&lt;/div&gt;

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

*prek* is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; prek is not production-ready yet. Some subcommands and languages are not implemented. See the current gaps for drop-in parity: [TODO](https://prek.j178.dev/todo/).
&gt;
&gt; It&#039;s already being adopted by [some projects](#who-is-using-prek), please give it a try - we&#039;d love your feedback!

## Features

- üöÄ A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ‚ö° About [10x faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and uses only a third of disk space.
- üîÑ Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- üèóÔ∏è Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. [workspace mode](https://prek.j178.dev/workspace/)).
- üêç Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- üì¶ [Built-in](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/) Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.

## How to migrate

prek is designed as a drop-in replacement:

- [Install prek](#installation)
- Replace `pre-commit` with `prek` in your commands
- Your existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` works unchanged

```console
$ prek run
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
typos....................................................................Passed
cargo fmt................................................................Passed
cargo clippy.............................................................Passed
```

For configuring `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and writing hooks, you can refer to the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) as prek is fully compatible with it.

## Why prek?

### prek is way faster

- It is about [10x faster](https://prek.j178.dev/benchmark/) than `pre-commit` and uses only a third of disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, [built in prek](https://prek.j178.dev/builtin/), which are faster than their Python counterparts.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- Built-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- `prek run` has some nifty improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
    - `prek run --directory &lt;dir&gt;` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- &lt;dir&gt; | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
    - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
    - `prek run [HOOK] [HOOK]` selects and runs multiple hooks.
- `prek list` command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.
- prek provides shell completions for `prek run &lt;hook_id&gt;` command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.

For more detailed improvements prek offers, take a look at [Difference from pre-commit](https://prek.j178.dev/diff/).

## Who is using prek?

prek is pretty new, but it is already being used or recommend by some projects and organizations:

- [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44995)
- [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/pull/3593)
- [basedpyright](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/pull/1413)
- [OpenLineage](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/3965)
- [Authlib](https://github.com/authlib/authlib/pull/804)

## Installation

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Standalone installer&lt;/summary&gt;

prek provides a standalone installer script to download and install the tool,

On Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.4/prek-installer.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha.4/prek-installer.ps1 | iex&quot;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;PyPI&lt;/summary&gt;

prek is published as Python binary wheel to PyPI, you can install it using `pip`, `uv` (recommended), or `pipx`:

```console
pip install prek

# or

uv tool install prek

# or

pipx install prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Homebrew&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
brew install prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;mise&lt;/summary&gt;

To use prek with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev):

```bash
mise use prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cargo&lt;/summary&gt;

Build from source using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/j178/prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;GitHub Releases&lt;/summary&gt;

prek release artifacts can be downloaded directly from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/j178/prek/releases).
&lt;/details&gt;

If installed via the standalone installer, prek can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
prek self update
```

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn&#039;t be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I&#039;ve learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

Our key objectives include:
- Matching GNU&#039;s output (stdout and error code) exactly
- Better error messages
- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)
- Improved performances
- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

Use [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

# What&#039;s Hurl?

Hurl is a command line tool that runs &lt;b&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/b&gt; defined in a simple &lt;b&gt;plain text format&lt;/b&gt;.

It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very
versatile: it can be used for both &lt;b&gt;fetching data&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;testing HTTP&lt;/b&gt; sessions.

Hurl makes it easy to work with &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; content, &lt;b&gt;REST / SOAP / GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; APIs, or any other &lt;b&gt;XML / JSON&lt;/b&gt; based APIs. 

```hurl
# Go home and capture token
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
csrf_token: xpath &quot;string(//meta[@name=&#039;_csrf_token&#039;]/@content)&quot;


# Do login!
POST https://example.org/login
X-CSRF-TOKEN: {{csrf_token}}
[Form]
user: toto
password: 1234
HTTP 302
```

Chaining multiple requests is easy:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/health
GET https://example.org/api/step1
GET https://example.org/api/step2
GET https://example.org/api/step3
```

# Also an HTTP Test Tool

Hurl can run HTTP requests but can also be used to &lt;b&gt;test HTTP responses&lt;/b&gt;.
Different types of queries and predicates are supported, from [XPath] and [JSONPath] on body response,
to assert on status code and response headers.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://hurl.dev/player.html?id=starwars&amp;speed=3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/poster-starwars.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Hurl Demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


It is well adapted for &lt;b&gt;REST / JSON APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4568&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
header &quot;X-Frame-Options&quot; == &quot;SAMEORIGIN&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.status&quot; == &quot;RUNNING&quot;    # Check the status code
jsonpath &quot;$.tests&quot; count == 25      # Check the number of items
jsonpath &quot;$.id&quot; matches /\d{4}/     # Check the format of the id
```

&lt;b&gt;HTML content&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;normalize-space(//head/title)&quot; == &quot;Hello world!&quot;
```

&lt;b&gt;GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; 

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~

and even &lt;b&gt;SOAP APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/InStock
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
SOAPAction: &quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot; xmlns:m=&quot;https://example.org&quot;&gt;
  &lt;soap:Header&gt;&lt;/soap:Header&gt;
  &lt;soap:Body&gt;
    &lt;m:GetStockPrice&gt;
      &lt;m:StockName&gt;GOOG&lt;/m:StockName&gt;
    &lt;/m:GetStockPrice&gt;
  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
HTTP 200
```

Hurl can also be used to test the &lt;b&gt;performance&lt;/b&gt; of HTTP endpoints

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/v1/pets
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
duration &lt; 1000  # Duration in ms
```

And check response bytes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

Finally, Hurl is easy to &lt;b&gt;integrate in CI/CD&lt;/b&gt;, with text, JUnit, TAP and HTML reports

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: light)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-dark.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; alt=&quot;HTML report&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

# Why Hurl?

&lt;ul class=&quot;showcase-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Text Format:&lt;/b&gt; for both devops and developers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast CLI:&lt;/b&gt; a command line for local dev and continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single Binary:&lt;/b&gt; easy to install, with no runtime required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

# Powered by curl

Hurl is a lightweight binary written in [Rust]. Under the hood, Hurl HTTP engine is
powered by [libcurl], one of the most powerful and reliable file transfer libraries.
With its text file format, Hurl adds syntactic sugar to run and test HTTP requests,
but it&#039;s still the [curl] that we love: __fast__, __efficient__ and __IPv6 / HTTP/3 ready__.

# Feedbacks

To support its development, [star Hurl on GitHub]!

[Feedback, suggestion, bugs or improvements] are welcome.

```hurl
POST https://hurl.dev/api/feedback
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
  &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Hurl is awesome!&quot;
}
HTTP 200
```

# Samples

To run a sample, edit a file with the sample content, and run Hurl:

```shell
$ vi sample.hurl

GET https://example.org

$ hurl sample.hurl
```

By default, Hurl behaves like [curl] and outputs the last HTTP response&#039;s [entry]. To have a test
oriented output, you can use [`--test` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --test sample.hurl
```

A particular response can be saved with [`[Options] section`](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#options):

```hurl
GET https://example.ord/cats/123
[Options]
output: cat123.txt    # use - to output to stdout
HTTP 200

GET https://example.ord/dogs/567
HTTP 200
```

Finally, Hurl can take files as input, or directories. In the latter case, Hurl will search files with `.hurl` extension recursively.

```shell
$ hurl --test integration/*.hurl
$ hurl --test .
```

You can check [Hurl tests suite] for more samples.

## Getting Data

A simple GET:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
```

Requests can be chained:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/a
GET https://example.org/b
HEAD https://example.org/c
GET https://example.org/c
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#method)

### HTTP Headers

A simple GET with headers:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#headers)

### Query Params

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
[Query]
order: newest
search: something to search
count: 100
```

Or:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news?order=newest&amp;search=something%20to%20search&amp;count=100
```

&gt; With `[Query]` section, params don&#039;t need to be URL escaped.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#query-parameters)

### Basic Authentication

```hurl
GET https://example.org/protected
[BasicAuth]
bob: secret
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#basic-authentication)

This is equivalent to construct the request with a [Authorization] header:

```hurl
# Authorization header value can be computed with `echo -n &#039;bob:secret&#039; | base64`
GET https://example.org/protected
Authorization: Basic Ym9iOnNlY3JldA== 
```

Basic authentication section allows per request authentication. If you want to add basic authentication to all the
requests of a Hurl file you could use [`-u/--user` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --user bob:secret login.hurl
```

[`--user`] option can also be set per request:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: bob:secret
HTTP 200

GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: alice:secret
HTTP 200
```

### Passing Data between Requests 

[Captures] can be used to pass data from one request to another:

```hurl
POST https://sample.org/orders
HTTP 201
[Captures]
order_id: jsonpath &quot;$.order.id&quot;

GET https://sample.org/orders/{{order_id}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/capturing-response.html)

## Sending Data

### Sending HTML Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/contact
[Form]
default: false
token: {{token}}

### Sending Multipart Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
[Multipart]
field1: value1
field2: file,example.txt;
# One can specify the file content type:
field3: file,example.zip; application/zip
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multipart-form-data)

Multipart forms can also be sent with a [multiline string body]:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=&quot;boundary&quot;
```
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;key1&quot;

value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload1&quot;; filename=&quot;data.txt&quot;
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello World!
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload2&quot;; filename=&quot;data.html&quot;
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;div&gt;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
--boundary--
```
~~~

In that case, files have to be inlined in the Hurl file.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)

### Posting a JSON Body

With an inline JSON:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;456&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#json-body)

With a local file:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
Content-Type: application/json
file,data.json;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#file-body)

### Templating a JSON Body

```hurl
PUT https://example.org/api/hits
Content-Type: application/json
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;{{a_string}}&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: {{a_bool}},
    &quot;key2&quot;: {{a_null}},
    &quot;key3&quot;: {{a_number}}
}
```

Variables can be initialized via command line:

```shell
$ hurl --variable a_string=apple \
       --variable a_bool=true \
       --variable a_null=null \
       --variable a_number=42 \
       test.hurl
```

Resulting in a PUT request with the following JSON body:

```
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;apple&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: true,
    &quot;key2&quot;: null,
    &quot;key3&quot;: 42
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html)

### Templating a XML Body

Using templates with [XML body] is not currently supported in Hurl. You can use templates in
[XML multiline string body] with variables to send a variable XML body:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/echo/post/xml
```xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Request&gt;
    &lt;Login&gt;{{login}}&lt;/Login&gt;
    &lt;Password&gt;{{password}}&lt;/Password&gt;
&lt;/Request&gt;
```
~~~

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)

### Using GraphQL Query

A simple GraphQL query:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
~~~

A GraphQL query with variables:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
query Hero($episode: Episode, $withFriends: Boolean!) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends @include(if: $withFriends) {
      name
    }
  }
}

variables {
  &quot;episode&quot;: &quot;JEDI&quot;,
  &quot;withFriends&quot;: false
}
```
~~~

GraphQL queries can also use [Hurl templates].

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#graphql-body)

### Using Dynamic Datas

[Functions] like `newUuid` and `newDate` can be used in templates to create dynamic datas:


A file that creates a dynamic email (i.e `0531f78f-7f87-44be-a7f2-969a1c4e6d97@test.com`):

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/foo
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;,
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;{{newUuid}}@test.com&quot;
}
```

A file that creates a dynamic query parameter (i.e `2024-12-02T10:35:44.461731Z`):

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/foo
[Query]
date: {{newDate}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html#functions)

## Testing Response

Responses are optional, everything after `HTTP` is part of the response asserts.

```hurl
# A request with (almost) no check:
GET https://foo.com

# A status code check:
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200

# A test on response body
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; == &quot;running&quot;
```

### Testing Status Code

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#version-status)

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
# Testing status code is in a 200-300 range
HTTP *
[Asserts]
status &gt;= 200
status &lt; 300
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#status-assert)

### Testing Response Headers

Use implicit response asserts to test header values:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#headers)


Or use explicit response asserts with [predicates]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 302
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#header-assert)

Implicit and explicit asserts can be combined:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

### Testing REST APIs

Asserting JSON body response (node values, collection count etc...) with [JSONPath]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order
screencapability: low
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.validated&quot; == true
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.firstName&quot; == &quot;Franck&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.lastName&quot; == &quot;Herbert&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.hasDevice&quot; == false
jsonpath &quot;$.links&quot; count == 12
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; != null
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches &quot;^order-\\d{8}$&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches /^order-\d{8}$/  # Alternative syntax with regex literal
jsonpath &quot;$.id&quot; matches /(?i)[a-z]*/        # See syntax for flags &lt;https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#grouping-and-flags&gt;
jsonpath &quot;$.created&quot; isIsoDate
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#jsonpath-assert)

### Testing HTML Response

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;string(/html/head/title)&quot; contains &quot;Example&quot; # Check title
xpath &quot;count(//p)&quot; == 2  # Check the number of p
xpath &quot;//p&quot; count == 2  # Similar assert for p
xpath &quot;boolean(count(//h2))&quot; == false  # Check there is no h2  
xpath &quot;//h2&quot; not exists  # Similar assert for h2
xpath &quot;string(//div[1])&quot; matches /Hello.*/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#xpath-assert)

### Testing Set-Cookie Attributes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Value]&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Expires]&quot; contains &quot;Wed, 13 Jan 2021&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Secure]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[HttpOnly]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[SameSite]&quot; == &quot;Lax&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#cookie-assert)

### Testing Bytes Content

Check the SHA-256 response body hash:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#sha-256-assert)

### SSL Certificate

Check the properties of a SSL certificate:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
certificate &quot;Subject&quot; == &quot;CN=example.org&quot;
certificate &quot;Issuer&quot; == &quot;C=US, O=Let&#039;s Encrypt, CN=R3&quot;
certificate &quot;Expire-Date&quot; daysAfterNow &gt; 15
certificate &quot;Serial-Number&quot; matches /[\da-f]+/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#ssl-certificate-assert)

### Checking Full Body

Use implicit body to test an exact JSON body match:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/cats/123
HTTP 200
{
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Purrsloud&quot;,
  &quot;species&quot; : &quot;Cat&quot;,
  &quot;favFoods&quot; : [&quot;wet food&quot;, &quot;dry food&quot;, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; food&quot;],
  &quot;birthYear&quot; : 2016,
  &quot;photo&quot; : &quot;https://learnwebcode.github.io/json-example/images/cat-2.jpg&quot;
}
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mullvad VPN desktop and mobile app

Welcome to the Mullvad VPN client app source code repository.
This is the VPN client software for the Mullvad VPN service.
For more information about the service, please visit our website,
[mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net) (Also accessible via Tor on our
[onion service](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/)).

This repository contains all the source code for the
desktop and mobile versions of the app. For desktop this includes the system service/daemon
([`mullvad-daemon`](mullvad-daemon/)), a graphical user interface ([GUI](desktop/)) and a command
line interface ([CLI](mullvad-cli/)). The Android app uses the same backing system service for the
tunnel and security but has a dedicated frontend in [android/](android/). iOS consists of a
completely standalone implementation that resides in [ios/](ios/).

## Releases

There are built and signed releases for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android available on
[our website](https://mullvad.net/download/) and on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/). The Android app is also available
on [Google Play] and [F-Droid] and the iOS version on [App Store].

[Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn
[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/
[App Store]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513

You can find our code signing keys as well as instructions for how to cryptographically verify
your download on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Platform/OS support

These are the operating systems and their versions that the app officially supports. It might
work on many more versions, but we don&#039;t test for those and can&#039;t guarantee the quality or
security.

| OS/Platform | Supported versions |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Windows     | 10 and 11          |
| macOS       | The three latest major releases |
| Linux (Ubuntu)| The two latest LTS releases and the latest non-LTS releases |
| Linux (Fedora) | The versions that are not yet [EOL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life) |
| Linux (Debian) | 12 and newer    |
| Android     | 8 and newer        |
| iOS         | 15.0 and newer     |

On Linux we test using the Gnome desktop environment. The app should, and probably does work
in other DEs, but we don&#039;t regularly test those.

## Features

Here is a table containing the features of the app across platforms. This is intended to reflect
the current state of the latest code in git, not necessarily any existing release.

## Security and anonymity

This app is a privacy preserving VPN client. As such it goes to great lengths to stop traffic
leaks. And basically all settings default to the more secure/private option. The user has to
explicitly allow more loose rules if desired. See the [dedicated security document] for details
on what the app blocks and allows, as well as how it does it.

[dedicated security document]: docs/security.md

## Checking out the code

This repository contains submodules needed for building the app. However, some of those submodules
also have further submodules that are quite large and not needed to build the app. So unless
you want the source code for OpenSSL, OpenVPN and a few other projects you should avoid a recursive
clone of the repository. Instead clone the repository normally and then get one level of submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app.git
cd mullvadvpn-app
git submodule update --init
```

On Android, Windows, Linux and macOS you also want to checkout the wireguard-go submodule:
```bash
git submodule update --init wireguard-go-rs/libwg/wireguard-go
```
Further details on why this is necessary can be found in the [wireguard-go-rs crate](./wireguard-go-rs/README.md).

We sign every commit on the `main` branch as well as our release tags. If you would like to verify
your checkout, you can find our developer keys on [Mullvad&#039;s Open Source page].

### Binaries submodule

This repository has a git submodule at `dist-assets/binaries`. This submodule contains binaries and
build scripts for third party code we need to bundle with the app. Such as OpenVPN, Wintun
etc.

This submodule conforms to the same integrity/security standards as this repository. Every merge
commit should be signed. And this main repository should only ever point to a signed merge commit
of the binaries submodule.

See the [binaries submodule&#039;s](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries) README for more
details about that repository.

## Building the app

See the [build instructions](BuildInstructions.md) for help building the app on desktop platforms.

For building the Android app, see the [instructions](./android/BuildInstructions.md) for Android.

For building the iOS app, see the [instructions](./ios/BuildInstructions.md) for iOS.

## Releasing the app

See [this](Release.md) for instructions on how to make a new release.

## Environment variables used by the service

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` - Helps debugging the firewall. Does different things depending on
  platform:
  * Linux: Set to `&quot;1&quot;` to add packet counters to all firewall rules.
  * macOS: Makes rules log the packets they match to the `pflog0` interface.
    * Set to `&quot;all&quot;` to add logging to all rules.
    * Set to `&quot;pass&quot;` to add logging to rules allowing packets.
    * Set to `&quot;drop&quot;` to add logging to rules blocking packets.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_SRC_VALID_MARK` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark` kernel parameter to `1` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise strict reverse path filtering
    may prevent relay traffic from reaching the daemon. If `rp_filter` is set to `1` on the interface
    that will be receiving relay traffic, and `src_valid_mark` is not set to `1`, the daemon will
    not be able to receive relay traffic.

* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_ARP_IGNORE` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from
    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` kernel parameter to `2` on Linux when a tunnel
    is established.
    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise an attacker who can send ARP
    requests to the device running Mullvad can figure out the in-tunnel IP.

* `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` - Allows changing the method that will be used for DNS configuration.
  By default this is automatically detected, but you can set it to one of the options below to
  choose a specific method.

  * Linux
    * `&quot;static-file&quot;`: change the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly
    * `&quot;resolvconf&quot;`: use the `resolvconf` program
    * `&quot;systemd&quot;`: use systemd&#039;s `resolved` service through DBus
    * `&quot;network-manager&quot;`: use `NetworkManager` service through DBus

  * Windows
    * `iphlpapi`: use the IP helper API
    * `netsh`: use the `netsh` program
    * `tcpip`: set TCP/IP parameters in the registry

* `TALPID_DISABLE_LOCAL_DNS_RESOLVER` - Set this variable to `1` to disable the local DNS resolver
  (macOS only).

* `TALPID_NEVER_FILTER_AAAA_QUERIES` - Set this variable to `1` to never ignore DNS AAAA queries
  (macOS only).

* `TALPID_FORCE_USERSPACE_WIREGUARD` - Forces the daemon to use the userspace implementation of
   WireGuard on Linux.

* `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` - Forces the daemon to always assume the host is online.

* `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR` - On Linux, forces the daemon to mount the `net_cls` controller in the
  specified directory if it isn&#039;t mounted already.

* `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` - On Linux and macOS, this restricts access to the management
  interface UDS socket to users in the specified group. This means that only users in that group can
  use the CLI and GUI. By default, everyone has access to the socket.

* `MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT` - When enabled, if the daemon encounters a fault (e.g. `SIGSEGV`),
  it will log a backtrace to stdout, and to `daemon.log`. By default, this is disabled in
  release-builds and enabled in debug-builds. Set variable to `1` or `0` to explicitly enable or
  disable this feature. Logging the backtrace causes heap allocation. Allocation is not signal safe,
  but here it runs in the signal handler. This is technically undefined behavior and therefore
  disabled by default. This usually works, but enable at your own risk.

### Development builds only

* `MULLVAD_API_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in API requests. E.g. `api.mullvad.net`.

* `MULLVAD_API_ADDR` - Set the IP address and port to use in API requests. E.g. `10.10.1.2:443`.

* `MULLVAD_API_DISABLE_TLS` - Use plain HTTP for API requests.

* `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in connection check requests. E.g. `am.i.mullvad.net`.

* `MULLVAD_ENABLE_DEV_UPDATES` - Enable version checks in development builds.

### Setting environment variables

#### Windows

Use `setx` from an elevated shell:

```bat
setx TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE 1 /m
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bat
sc.exe stop mullvadvpn
sc.exe start mullvadvpn
```

#### Linux

Edit the systemd unit file via `systemctl edit mullvad-daemon.service`:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR=1&quot;
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mullvad-daemon
```

#### macOS

Use `plutil`:

```bash
sudo plutil -replace EnvironmentVariables -json &#039;{&quot;TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR&quot;: &quot;1&quot;}&#039; /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

For the change to take effect, restart the daemon:

```bash
launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist
```

## Environment variables used by the desktop frontend

* `MULLVAD_PATH` - Allows changing the path to the folder with the `mullvad-problem-report` tool
   when running in development mode. Defaults to: `&lt;repo&gt;/target/debug/`.
* `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION` - If set to `1`, notification will be disabled when
   an update is available.


## Command line tools for Electron app development

- `$ npm run develop` - develop app with live-reload enabled
- `$ npm run lint` - lint code
- `$ npm run pack:&lt;OS&gt;` - prepare app for distribution for your platform. Where `&lt;OS&gt;` can be
  `linux`, `mac` or `win`
- `$ npm test` - run tests


## Tray icon on Linux

The requirements for displaying a tray icon vary between different desktop environments. If the

### Mullvad Daemon

The daemon is implemented in Rust and is implemented in several crates. The main, or top level,
crate that builds the final daemon binary is `mullvad-daemon` which then depend on the others.

In general one can look at the daemon as split into two parts, the crates starting with `talpid`
and the crates starting with `mullvad`. The `talpid` crates are supposed to be completely unrelated
to Mullvad specific things. A `talpid` crate is not allowed to know anything about the API through
which the daemon fetch Mullvad account details or download VPN server lists for example. The
`talpid` components should be viewed as a generic VPN client with extra privacy and anonymity
preserving features. The crates having `mullvad` in their name on the other hand make use of the
`talpid` components to build a secure and Mullvad specific VPN client.


- **Cargo.toml** - Main Rust workspace definition. See this file for which folders here are daemon
  Rust crates.
- **mullvad-daemon/** - Main Rust crate building the daemon binary.
- **talpid-core/** - Main crate of the VPN client implementation itself. Completely Mullvad agnostic
  privacy preserving VPN client library.


## Vocabulary

Explanations for some common words used in the documentation and code in this repository.

- **App** - This entire product (everything in this repository) is the &quot;Mullvad VPN App&quot;, or App for
  short.
  - **Daemon** - Refers to the `mullvad-daemon` Rust program. This headless program exposes a
    management interface that can be used to control the daemon
  - **Frontend** - Term used for any program or component that connects to the daemon management
    interface and allows a user to control the daemon.
    - **GUI** - The Electron + React program that is a graphical frontend for the Mullvad VPN App.
    - **CLI** - The Rust program named `mullvad` that is a terminal based frontend for the Mullvad
      VPN app.


## File paths used by Mullvad VPN app

A list of file paths written to and read from by the various components of the Mullvad VPN app

### Daemon

On Windows, when a process runs as a system service the variable `%LOCALAPPDATA%` expands to
`C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local`.

All directory paths are defined in, and fetched from, the `mullvad-paths` crate.

#### Settings

The settings directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_SETTINGS_DIR` environment variable.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `/etc/mullvad-vpn/` |
| macOS | `/etc/mullvad-vpn/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mullvad VPN\` |
| Android | [`getFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getFilesDir()) |

#### Logs

The log directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_LOG_DIR` environment variable.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `/var/log/mullvad-vpn/` + systemd |
| macOS | `/var/log/mullvad-vpn/` |
| Windows | `C:\ProgramData\Mullvad VPN\` |
| Android | [`getFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getFilesDir()) |

#### Cache

The cache directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

| Windows | `C:\ProgramData\Mullvad VPN\cache` |
| Android | [`getCacheDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getCacheDir())  |

#### RPC address file

The full path to the RPC address file can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`
environment variable.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `/var/run/mullvad-vpn` |
| macOS | `/var/run/mullvad-vpn` |
| Windows | `//./pipe/Mullvad VPN` |
| Android | [`getNoBackupFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContextWrapper#getNoBackupFilesDir()) |

### Desktop Electron app

The desktop Electron app has a specific settings file that is configured for each user. The path is
set in the `desktop/packages/mullvad-vpn/src/main/gui-settings.ts` file.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Mullvad VPN/gui_settings.json` |

&lt;br&gt;

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; The web-vault requires the use a secure context for the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
&gt; That means it will only work via `http://localhost:8000` (using the port from the example below) or if you [enable HTTPS](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS).

The recommended way to install and use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).
See [which container image to use](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Which-container-image-to-use) for an explanation of the provided tags.

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

Alternatively, you can also [build Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Building-binary) yourself.

While Vaultwarden is based upon the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs) which has built-in support for TLS our recommendation would be that you setup a reverse proxy (see [proxy examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80
```

&gt; üöß **Beta Software**
&gt;
&gt; Rolldown is currently in beta status. While it can already handle most production use cases, there may still be bugs and rough edges. Most notably, the built-in minification feature is still in alpha status.

# Rolldown

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

For more information, please check out the documentation at [rolldown.rs](https://rolldown.rs/about).

## VoidZero Inc.

Rolldown is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## Contributing

## ‚öì Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Our goal is to enable a new generation of faster, more reliable development tools by providing:

- **Performance**: 2-100x faster than existing JavaScript tools
- **Reliability**: 100% compatibility with JavaScript and TypeScript standards
- **Modularity**: Use individual tools or compose them into complete toolchains
- **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and seamless editor integration

We are building a parser, linter, formatter, transformer, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

For more information, check out our documentation at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs) and architecture guide in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## VoidZero Inc.

Oxc is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/blog).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## üôãWho&#039;s using Oxc?

- [Rolldown] uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing and transformation.
- [Nova engine](https://trynova.dev) uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing.
- [Rolldown][rolldown], [swc-node](https://github.com/swc-project/swc-node) and [knip](https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip) use the [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] crate for module resolution.
- Projects and companies like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/4c20c23c16dd60f380ce9fe98afc93041a7e1562/oxlint.json), [Shopify](https://oxc.rs/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html#_50-100-times-faster-than-eslint), ByteDance and Shopee uses oxlint for linting.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ‚å®Ô∏è Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

We have optimized Rust compilation speed to ensure developing your own Oxc-based tools remains efficient.
Our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain) complete in approximately 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

## üéØ Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### üî∏ AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling, any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.

#### üèÜ Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

### üî∏ Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### üèÜ Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

### üî∏ Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### üî∏ Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript, React, ES6 transforms are complete.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### üî∏ Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indicates that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### üî∏ Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

See [minification benchmarks](https://github.com/privatenumber/minification-benchmarks) for comparisons.

### üî∏ Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

---

## üß™Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front-end to your dev env.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.9.8 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-09-10)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ‚úì installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># cs2-dumper

An external offset/interface dumper for Counter-Strike 2, with support for both Windows &amp; Linux. Powered
by [memflow](https://github.com/memflow/memflow).

The native Linux version is available in the [linux](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/tree/linux) branch (currently
outdated).

For a work-in-progress offline version, check out the [cs2-analyzer](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-analyzer) repository or
view its included web demo [here](https://a2x.github.io/cs2-analyzer).

## Getting Started

You can download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/releases) or compile it yourself.
Note that compiling it yourself requires your Rust compiler version to be at least 1.74.0 or newer.

## Usage

1. Ensure the game is running (Being in the main menu should suffice).
2. Run the `cs2-dumper` executable.

_Note:_ If you run the executable without specifying an optional memflow connector name, it will automatically use the
[memflow-native](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-native) OS layer to read the memory of the game process. If you
wish to use an existing memflow connector instead, such as **pcileech** or **kvm**, you can pass the `connector` and
optional `connector-args` arguments to the program. These connectors can be installed and managed using
the [memflowup](https://github.com/memflow/memflowup) tool.

E.g (for pcileech). `cs2-dumper -c pcileech -a :device=FPGA -vv`

Certain connectors, such as the [kvm](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-kvm) connector on Linux or
the [pcileech](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-pcileech) / [winio](https://github.com/a2x/memflow-winio)
connectors on Windows, require elevated privileges to work. So either run the `cs2-dumper` executable with `sudo` on
Linux or as an administrator on Windows.

### Available Arguments

- `-c, --connector &lt;connector&gt;`: The name of the memflow connector to use.
- `-a, --connector-args &lt;connector-args&gt;`: Additional arguments to pass to the memflow connector.
- `-f, --file-types &lt;file-types&gt;`: The types of files to generate. Default: `cs`, `hpp`,  `json`, `rs`.
- `-i, --indent-size &lt;indent-size&gt;`: The number of spaces to use per indentation level. Default: `4`.
- `-o, --output &lt;output&gt;`: The output directory to write the generated files to. Default: `output`.
- `-p, --process-name &lt;process-name&gt;`: The name of the game process. Default: `cs2.exe`.
- `-v...`: Increase logging verbosity. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-h, --help`: Print help.
- `-V, --version`: Print version.

## Running Tests

To run the few basic provided tests, use the following command: `cargo test -- --nocapture`.

![Rayhunter Logo - An Orca taking a bite out of a cellular signal bar](https://www.eff.org/files/styles/media_browser_preview/public/banner_library/rayhunter-banner.png)

Rayhunter is a project for detecting IMSI catchers, also known as cell-site simulators or stingrays. It was first designed to run on a cheap mobile hotspot called the Orbic RC400L, but thanks to community efforts can [support some other devices as well](https://efforg.github.io/rayhunter/supported-devices.html).
It&#039;s also designed to be as easy to install and use as possible, regardless of your level of technical skills, and to minimize false positives. 

&amp;rarr;  Check out the [installation guide](https://efforg.github.io/rayhunter/installation.html) to get started.

&amp;rarr; To learn more about the aim of the project, and about IMSI catchers in general, please check out our [introductory blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/meet-rayhunter-new-open-source-tool-eff-detect-cellular-spying). 

&amp;rarr; For discussion, help, or to join the mattermost channel and get involved with the project and community check out the [many ways listed here](https://efforg.github.io/rayhunter/support-feedback-community.html)!

  &lt;/p&gt;

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew install codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you&#039;re having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex CLI supports [MCP servers](./docs/advanced.md#model-context-protocol-mcp). Enable by adding an `mcp_servers` section to your `~/.codex/config.toml`.


### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

### RustFS vs Other object storage

| RustFS | Other object storage|
| - | - |
| Powerful Console | Simple and useless Console |
| Developed based on Rust language, memory is safer | Developed in Go or C, with potential issues like memory GC/leaks |
| Does not report logs to third-party countries  | Reporting logs to other third countries may violate national security laws |
| Licensed under Apache, more business-friendly  | AGPL V3 License and other License, polluted open source and License traps, infringement of intellectual property rights |
| Comprehensive S3 support, works with domestic and international cloud providers  | Full support for S3, but no local cloud vendor support |
| Rust-based development, strong support for secure and innovative devices  | Poor support for edge gateways and secure innovative devices|
| Stable commercial prices, free community support | High pricing, with costs up to $250,000 for 1PiB |
| No risk | Intellectual property risks and risks of prohibited uses |

## Quickstart

To get started with RustFS, follow these steps:

1. **One-click installation script (Option 1)‚Äã‚Äã**

   ```bash
   curl -O  https://rustfs.com/install_rustfs.sh &amp;&amp; bash install_rustfs.sh
   ```

2. **Docker Quick Start (Option 2)‚Äã‚Äã**

  ```bash
   # create data and logs directories
   mkdir -p data logs

   # using latest alpha version
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:alpha

   # Specific version
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0.alpha.45
   ```

3. **Build from Source (Option 3) - Advanced Users**

   For developers who want to build RustFS Docker images from source with multi-architecture support:

   ```bash
   # Build multi-architecture images locally
   ./docker-buildx.sh --build-arg RELEASE=latest

   # Build and push to registry
   ./docker-buildx.sh --push

   # Build specific version
   ./docker-buildx.sh --release v1.0.0 --push

   # Build for custom registry
   ./docker-buildx.sh --registry your-registry.com --namespace yourname --push
   ```

   The `docker-buildx.sh` script supports:
   - **Multi-architecture builds**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
   - **Automatic version detection**: Uses git tags or commit hashes
   - **Registry flexibility**: Supports Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
   - **Build optimization**: Includes caching and parallel builds

   You can also use Make targets for convenience:

   ```bash
   make docker-buildx                    # Build locally
   make docker-buildx-push               # Build and push
   make docker-buildx-version VERSION=v1.0.0  # Build specific version
   make help-docker                      # Show all Docker-related commands
   ```

4. **Access the Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000` to access the RustFS console, default username and password is `rustfsadmin` .
5. **Create a Bucket**: Use the console to create a new bucket for your objects.
6. **Upload Objects**: You can upload files directly through the console or use S3-compatible APIs to interact with your RustFS instance.

## Overview

Lighthouse is:

- Ready for use on Ethereum consensus mainnet.
- Fully open-source, licensed under Apache 2.0.
- Security-focused. Fuzzing techniques have been continuously applied and several external security reviews have been performed.
- Built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), a modern language providing unique safety guarantees and
	excellent performance (comparable to C++).
- Funded by various organisations, including Sigma Prime, the
	Ethereum Foundation, Consensys, the Decentralization Foundation and private individuals.
- Actively involved in the specification and security analysis of the
	Ethereum proof-of-stake consensus specification.

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

Just &quot;uv&quot;, please. See the [style guide](./STYLE.md#styling-uv) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

  &lt;h3&gt;
    Welcome to the era of Sovereign Computing
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    StartOS is an open source Linux distribution optimized for running a personal server. It facilitates the discovery, installation, network configuration, service configuration, data backup, dependency management, and health monitoring of self-hosted software services.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/StartOS.png&quot; alt=&quot;StartOS&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

## Running StartOS
&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; StartOS is in beta. It lacks features. It doesn&#039;t always work perfectly. Start9 servers are not plug and play. Using them properly requires some effort and patience. Please do not use StartOS or purchase a server if you are unable or unwilling to follow instructions and learn new concepts.

### üí∞ Buy a Start9 server
This is the most convenient option. Simply [buy a server](https://store.start9.com) from Start9 and plug it in.

### üë∑ Build your own server
This option is easier than you might imagine, and there are 4 reasons why you might prefer it:
1. You already have hardware
1. You want to save on shipping costs
1. You prefer not to divulge your physical address
1. You just like building things

To pursue this option, follow one of our [DIY guides](https://start9.com/latest/diy).

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing
There are multiple ways to contribute: work directly on StartOS, package a service for the marketplace, or help with documentation and guides. To learn more about contributing, see [here](https://start9.com/contribute/).

To report security issues, please email our security team - security@start9.com.

## üåé Marketplace
There are dozens of services available for StartOS, and new ones are being added all the time. Check out the full list of available services [here](https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace). To read more about the Marketplace ecosystem, check out this [blog post](https://blog.start9.com/start9-marketplace-strategy/)

## Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust

Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use
and expressive. Key features are:

- Lazy | Eager execution
- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Query optimization
- Multi-threaded
- Written in Rust
- SIMD
- Powerful expression API
- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL
- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming.

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

## Contributing

## Managed/Distributed Polars

Do you want a managed solution or scale out to distributed clusters? Consider our
[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

packaging as Debian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

If you&#039;re an **ALT** user, you can install ripgrep from the

If you&#039;re a **Rust programmer**, ripgrep can be installed with `cargo`.

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.88.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.88.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your friendly neighborhood package manager).
Then you just need to add MUSL support to your Rust toolchain and rebuild
ripgrep, which yields a fully static executable:

```
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Applying the `--features` flag from above works as expected. If you want to
build a static executable with MUSL and with PCRE2, then you will need to have
`musl-gcc` installed, which might be in a separate package from the actual
MUSL library, depending on your Linux distribution.


### Running tests

ripgrep is relatively well-test

# Time-aware multimodal data stack and visualizations
Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It&#039;s used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

Rerun is easy to use!
Use the Rerun SDK (available for C++, Python and Rust) to log data like images, tensors, point clouds, and text.
Logs are streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.
You can also query the logged data through [our dataframe API](https://rerun.io/docs/howto/dataframe-api).

[Get started](#getting-started) in minutes ‚Äì no account needed.

* [Run the Rerun Viewer in your browser](https://www.rerun.io/viewer)
* [Read about what Rerun is and who it is for](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-rerun)

### A short taste
```py
import rerun as rr  # pip install rerun-sdk

rr.init(&quot;rerun_example_app&quot;)

rr.spawn()  # Spawn a child process with a viewer and connect
# rr.save(&quot;recording.rrd&quot;)  # Stream all logs to disk
# rr.connect_grpc()  # Connect to a remote viewer

# Associate subsequent data with 42 on the ‚Äúframe‚Äù timeline
rr.set_time(&quot;frame&quot;, sequence=42)

# Log colored 3D points to the entity at `path/to/points`
rr.log(&quot;path/to/points&quot;, rr.Points3D(positions, colors=colors))
‚Ä¶
```

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting started
* [**C++**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/cpp)
* [**Python**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python): `pip install rerun-sdk` or on [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock)
* [**Rust**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/rust): `cargo add rerun`

### Installing the Rerun Viewer binary
To stream log data over the network or load our `.rrd` data files you also need the `rerun` binary.
It can be installed with `pip install rerun-sdk` or with `cargo install rerun-cli --locked --features nasm` (see note below).
Note that only the Python SDK comes bundled with the Viewer whereas C++ &amp; Rust always rely on a separate install.

**Note**: the `nasm` Cargo feature requires the [`nasm`](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) CLI to be installed and available in your path.
Alternatively, you may skip enabling this feature, but this may result in inferior video decoding performance.

You should now be able to run `rerun --help` in any terminal.

## Status
We are in active development.
There are many features we want to add, and the API is still evolving.
_Expect breaking changes!_

Some shortcomings:
* [The viewer slows down when there are too many entities](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7115)
* [We don&#039;t support transparency yet](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1611)
* The data you want to visualize must fit in RAM
  - See &lt;https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/limit-ram&gt; for how to bound memory use.
  - We plan on having a disk-based data store some time in the future.
* [Multi-million point clouds can be slow](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1136)


## What is Rerun for?

Rerun is built to help you understand and improve complex processes that include rich multimodal data, like 2D, 3D, text, time series, tensors, etc.
It is used in many industries, including robotics, simulation, computer vision,
or anything that involves a lot of sensors or other signals that evolve over time.

### Example use case
Say you&#039;re building a vacuum cleaning robot and it keeps running into walls. Why is it doing that? You need some tool to debug it, but a normal debugger isn&#039;t gonna be helpful. Similarly, just logging text won&#039;t be very helpful either. The robot may log &quot;Going through doorway&quot; but that won&#039;t explain why it thinks the wall is a door.

What you need is a visual and temporal debugger, that can log all the different representations of the world the robots holds in its little head, such as:

* RGB camera feed
* depth images
* lidar scan
* segmentation image (how the robot interprets what it sees)
* its 3D map of the apartment
* all the objects the robot has detected (or thinks it has detected), as 3D shapes in the 3D map
* its confidence in its prediction
* etc

You also want to see how all these streams of data evolve over time so you can go back and pinpoint exactly what went wrong, when and why.

Maybe it turns out that a glare from the sun hit one of the sensors in the wrong way, confusing the segmentation network leading to bad object detection. Or maybe it was a bug in the lidar scanning code. Or maybe the robot thought it was somewhere else in the apartment, because its odometry was broken. Or it could be one of a thousand other things. Rerun will help you find out!

But seeing the world from the point of the view of the robot is not just for debugging - it will also give you ideas on how to improve the algorithms, new test cases to set up, or datasets to collect. It will also let you explain the brains of the robot to your colleagues, boss, and customers. And so on. Seeing is believing, and an image is worth a thousand words, and multimodal temporal logging is worth a thousand images :)

While seeing and understanding your data is core to making progress in robotics, there is one more thing:
You can also use the data you collected for visualization to create new datasets for training and evaluating the models and algorithms that run on your robot.
Rerun provides query APIs to make it easy to extract clean datasets from your recording for exactly that purpose.

Of course, Rerun is useful for much more than just robots. Any time you have any form of sensors, or 2D or 3D state evolving over time, Rerun is a great tool.


## Business model
Rerun uses an open-core model. Everything in this repository will stay open source and free (both as in beer and as in freedom).

We are also building a commercial data platform.
Right now that is only available for a few select design partners.
[Click here if you&#039;re interested](https://rerun.io/pricing).

The Rerun open source project targets the needs of individual developers.
The commercial product targets the needs specific to teams that build and run computer vision and robotics products.
