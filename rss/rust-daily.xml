[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the open-source reactive database designed to
make life easy for web app developers, whether human or LLM. Fetch data and
perform business logic with strong consistency by writing pure TypeScript.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client
libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.
[Read the docs to learn more](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/).

Development of the Convex backend is led by the Convex team. We
[welcome bug fixes](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[love receiving feedback](https://discord.gg/convex). We keep this repository
synced with any internal development work within a handful of days.

## Getting Started

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/) to learn more about Convex
and follow our getting started guides.

The easiest way to build with Convex is through our
[cloud platform](https://www.convex.dev/plans), which includes a generous free
tier and lets you focus on building your application without worrying about
infrastructure. Many small applications and side-projects can operate entirely
on the free tier with zero cost and zero maintenance.

## Self Hosting

The self-hosted product includes most features of the cloud product, including
the dashboard and CLI. Self-hosted Convex works well with a variety of tools
including Neon, Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, RDS, Sqlite, Postgres, and more.

You can either use Docker (recommended) or a prebuilt binary to self host
Convex. Check out our [self-hosting guide](./self-hosted/README.md) for detailed
instructions. Community support for self-hosting is available in the
`#self-hosted` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/convex).

## Community &amp; Support

- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/convex) for help and
  discussions.
- Report issues when building and using the open source Convex backend through
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/issues)

## Building from source

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).

## Disclaimers

- If you choose to self-host, we recommend following the self-hosting guide. If
  you are instead building from source, make sure to change your instance secret
  and admin key from the defaults in the repo.
- Convex is battle tested most thoroughly on Linux and Mac. On Windows, it has
  less experience. If you run into issues, please message us on
  [Discord](https://convex.dev/community) in the `#self-hosted` channel.
- Convex self-hosted builds contain a beacon to help Convex improve the product.
  The information is minimal and anonymous and helpful to Convex, but if you
  really want to disable it, you can set the `--disable-beacon` flag on the
  backend binary. The beacon&#039;s messages print in the log and only include
  - A random identifier for your deployment (not used elsewhere)
  - Migration version of your database
  - Git rev of the backend
  - Uptime of the backend

## Repository layout

- `crates/` contains Rust code

  - Main binary
    - `local_backend/` is an application server on top of the `Runtime`. This is
      the serving edge for the Convex cloud.

- `npm-packages/` contains both our public and internal TypeScript packages.
  - Internal packages
    - `udf-runtime/` sets up the user-defined functions JS environment for
      queries and mutations
    - `udf-tests/` is a collection of functions used in testing the isolate
      layer
    - `system-udfs/` contains functions used by the Convex system e.g. the CLI

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use‚Äîwhether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]‚Äîwith a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes‚Äîwhich is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains ‚Äî such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations‚Ä¶. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.

CocoIndex makes it effortless to transform data with AI, and keep source data and target in sync. Whether you‚Äôre building a vector index for RAG, creating knowledge graphs, or performing any custom data transformations ‚Äî goes beyond SQL.

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot; src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/venn2.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;



## Exceptional velocity
Just declare transformation in dataflow with ~100 lines of python

```python
# import
data[&#039;content&#039;] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data[&#039;out&#039;] = data[&#039;content&#039;]
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, developers don&#039;t explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. They just need to define transformation/formula for a set of source data.

## Plug-and-Play Building Blocks
Native builtins for different source, targets and transformations. Standardize interface, make it 1-line code switch between different components - as easy as assembling building blocks.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/components.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Data Freshness
CocoIndex keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4eb29b3-84ee-4fa0-a1e2-80eedeeabde6&quot; alt=&quot;Incremental Processing&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It has out-of-box support for incremental indexing:
- minimal recomputation on source or logic change.
- (re-)processing necessary portions; reuse cache when possible

## Quick Start:
If you&#039;re new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out
- üìñ [Documentation](https://cocoindex.io/docs)
- ‚ö°  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- üé¨ [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```bash
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don&#039;t have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.


## Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name=&quot;TextEmbedding&quot;)
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path=&quot;markdown_files&quot;))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc[&quot;chunks&quot;] = doc[&quot;content&quot;].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=&quot;markdown&quot;, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc[&quot;chunks&quot;].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;] = chunk[&quot;text&quot;].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model=&quot;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&quot;))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc[&quot;filename&quot;], location=chunk[&quot;location&quot;],
                                   text=chunk[&quot;text&quot;], embedding=chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        &quot;doc_embeddings&quot;,
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=[&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;location&quot;],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name=&quot;embedding&quot;,
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:

  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/releases/tag/v0.7.0-alpha.0&quot;&gt;‚ú® Dioxus 0.7 is in alpha - test it out! ‚ú®&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Build for web, desktop, and mobile, and more with a single codebase. Zero-config setup, integrated hot-reloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        h1 { &quot;High-Five counter: {count}&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, &quot;Up high!&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, &quot;Down low!&quot; }
    }
}
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Unique features:

- Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more)
- [Ergonomic state management](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/release-050) combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte
- Built-in featureful, type-safe, fullstack web framework
- Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Subsecond Rust hot-patching and asset hot-reloading
- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup, styles, and see changes in milliseconds. Use our experimental `dx serve --hotpatch` to update Rust code in real time.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Build Beautiful Apps

Dioxus apps are styled with HTML and CSS. Use the built-in TailwindCSS support or load your favorite CSS library. Easily call into native code (objective-c, JNI, Web-Sys) for a perfect native touch.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/ebou2.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Experimental Native Renderer

Render using web-sys, webview, server-side-rendering, liveview, or even with our experimental WGPU-based renderer. Embed Dioxus in Bevy, WGPU, or even run on embedded Linux!

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/native-blitz-wgpu.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## First-party primitive components

Get started quickly with a complete set of primitives modeled after shadcn/ui and Radix-Primitives.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/primitive-components.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Productive, typesafe, fullstack web framework

Directly call your backend from your frontend with our built-in type-safe RPC using [`server_fn`](http://crates.io/crates/server_fn). Supports streaming, suspense, bundle splitting, websockets, and more.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
  let mut fortune = use_signal(|| &quot;Fetch a fortune!&quot;);
  rsx! {
    h1 { &quot;{fortune}&quot; }
    button {
      onclick: move |_| async move {
        fortune.set(fetch_fortune().await.unwrap());
      }
    }
  }
}

#[server]
async fn fetch_fortune() -&gt; ServerFnResult&lt;String&gt; {
  &quot;Dioxus is super productive!&quot;.to_string()
}
```

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/bundle.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/docs.avif&quot;&gt;

## Running the examples

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli to test out features like hot-reloading. To install the most recent binary CLI, you can use cargo binstall.

```sh
cargo binstall dioxus-cli@0.7.0-rc.0 --force
```

If this CLI is out-of-date, you can install it directly from git

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You will need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui ÁöÑ‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØëÊñáÊ°£ / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies.
Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, ‚Ä¶)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

#### Render-to-texture
You can also render your 3D scene to a texture and display it using [`ui.image(‚Ä¶)`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Ui.html#method.image). You first need to convert the native texture to an [`egui::TextureId`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display

There is an ESP32 with a built in 320 x 240 2.8&quot; LCD display with a touch screen called the &quot;ESP32-2432S028R&quot;, since this doesn&#039;t roll of the tongue, I propose it should be renamed the &quot;Cheap Yellow Display&quot; or CYD for short. This display is only about $15 delivered so I think it&#039;s really good value.

![image](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display/assets/1562562/76c3d481-2523-4b6f-881c-2e29f9368cd0)

## Features

The CYD has the following features:

- ESP32 (With Wifi and Bluetooth)
- 320 x 240 LCD Display (2.8&quot;)
- Touch Screen (Resistive)
- USB for powering and programming
- SD Card Slot, LED and some additional pins broken out

## Who is it good for?

I think it&#039;s useful for the following types of people:

- **People just getting started with working hardware** - as everything is already connected, there is no soldering or additional components required
- **People who are familiar with working with hardware, but are lazy** - (like me) Sometimes you just want to build a project without having to assemble any hardware
- **People who aren&#039;t really looking to learn anything, but just want to build some cool things** - More about this later.

## What is the purpose of this page?

So this is pretty nice hardware and a cheap price, but the software instructions/support around it is pretty poor. Just a single link to a zip file on a random website.

A couple of years ago I released the [ESP32 Trinity](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Trinity), which is an open source ESP32 board for controlling Matrix panels. I think the main benefit people get out of the work I did on the Trinty is not the hardware, but the documentation, example code and ready to go projects.

I&#039;m no longer creating hardware products, but I think it would be interesting if we could create the same kind of community around this display, where people can share examples and projects made for this display.

## How do I know if a display is a CYD?

## Status

This project has reached a minimum-viable-product level of quality. Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu&#039;s design is subject to change as it matures.

## Learning About Nu

The [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).

We&#039;re also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn); come and chat with us!

## Installation

To quickly install Nu:

```bash
# Linux and macOS
brew install nushell
# Windows
winget install nushell
```

To use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)

For details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

## Configuration

The default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)
which are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.

It sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can
then customize this file for their specific needs.

To see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.

```rust
$nu.config-path
```

Please see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.


## Philosophy

Nu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.
Rather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.
For example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.
These values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a &#039;pipeline&#039;.

### Pipelines

In Unix, it&#039;s common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.
Nu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.
As in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.
Additionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).
Commands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:

-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)
-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == &quot;dir&quot;`)
-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)

Commands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot; | table
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ

```

Because most of the time you&#039;ll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.
We could have also written the above:

```shell
ls | where type == &quot;dir&quot;
```

Being able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.
For example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.

```shell
ps | where cpu &gt; 0
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ

```

### Opening files

Nu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).
For example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:

```shell
open Cargo.toml
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ bin              ‚îÇ [table 1 row]      ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ dependencies     ‚îÇ {record 25 fields} ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ dev-dependencies ‚îÇ {record 8 fields}  ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ features         ‚îÇ {record 10 fields} ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ package          ‚îÇ {record 13 fields} ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ patch            ‚îÇ {record 1 field}   ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ profile          ‚îÇ {record 3 fields}  ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ target           ‚îÇ {record 3 fields}  ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚îÇ workspace        ‚îÇ {record 1 field}   ‚îÇ
# =&gt; ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ
```

We can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package
# =&gt; ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ

And if needed we can drill down further:

```shell
open Cargo.toml | get package.version
# =&gt; 0.72.0
```

### Plugins

Nu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.

Plugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.
These binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.
If the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.
If the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.

The [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical
topics that have been presented.

## Goals

Nu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.

-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).

-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.

-   Nu&#039;s workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).

-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.

-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.

Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>ripgrep (rg)
------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

```

If you&#039;re an **Ubuntu Cosmic (18.10)** (or newer) user, ripgrep is
[available](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rust-ripgrep) using the same
packaging as Debian:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

If you&#039;re an **ALT** user, you can install ripgrep from the

```
$ sudo xbps-install -Syv ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re a **Rust programmer**, ripgrep can be installed with `cargo`.

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.85.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.85.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your

# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet

Welcome to the [Rust][rust] implementation of [Apache Arrow], the popular in-memory columnar format.

This repository contains the following crates:

| Crate              | Description                                                                  | Latest API Docs                                  | README                            |

The current development version the API documentation in this repo can be found [here](https://arrow.apache.org/rust).

Note: previously the [`object_store`] crate was also part of this repository,
but it has been moved to the [arrow-rs-object-store repository]

## Release Versioning and Schedule

The Arrow Rust project releases approximately monthly and follows [Semantic
Versioning].

Due to available maintainer and testing bandwidth, [`arrow`] crates ([`arrow`],
[`arrow-flight`], etc.) are released on the same schedule with the same versions
as the [`parquet`] and [`parquet-derive`] crates.

This crate releases every month. We release new major versions (with potentially
breaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor
versions in the intervening months. See [ticket #5368] for more details.

To keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major
and minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes
is described in the [contributing] guide.

[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes

Planned Release Schedule

### Rust Version Compatibility Policy

arrow-rs and parquet are built and tested with stable Rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) that can only be updated in major releases on a need by basis (e.g. project dependencies bump their MSRV or a particular Rust feature is useful for us etc.). The new MSRV if selected will be at least 6 months old. The minor releases are guaranteed to have the same MSRV.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

### Guidelines for `panic` vs `Result`

In general, use panics for bad states that are unreachable, unrecoverable or harmful.
For those caused by invalid user input, however, we prefer to report that invalidity
gracefully as an error result instead of panicking. In general, invalid input should result
in an `Error` as soon as possible. It _is_ ok for code paths after validation to assume
validation has already occurred and panic if not. See [ticket #6737] for more nuances.

[ticket #6737]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6737

### Deprecation Guidelines

Minor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows
downstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This
gives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.

To deprecate an API:

- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated
- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition

The deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please
consult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the
`#[deprecated(since = &quot;...&quot;, note = &quot;...&quot;)]` attribute.

For example

```rust
#[deprecated(since = &quot;51.0.0&quot;, note = &quot;Use `date_part` instead&quot;)]
```

In general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after
they were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API
deprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs
may be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the
maintainers.

[object_store-readme]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store/blob/main/README.md

Collectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.

For example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the
[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),
evaluate it in-memory using Arrow&#039;s columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),
and send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).

Generally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow
arrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,
including `join`s and window functions.

You can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.

## Arrow Rust Community

The `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.

The Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is
a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:

1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list
2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]
3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)

The Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and
this plays a critical role in the release process.

For design discussions we generally use GitHub issues.

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

[examples/]: quiche/examples/

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.82 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[BoringSSL]: https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

2025.10.2 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-10-03)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ‚úì installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

This repository has the source code for Comprehensive Rust ü¶Ä, a multi-day Rust
course developed by the Android team. The course covers all aspects of Rust,
from basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on
[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].

[Android]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/android.html
[Chromium]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/chromium.html
[bare-metal]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html
[concurrency]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html

Read the course at **https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/**.

## Course Format and Target Audience

The course is used internally at Google to teach Rust to experienced software
engineers, typically with a background in C++ or Java.

The course is taught in a classroom setting, and we hope it will be useful for
others who want to teach Rust to their team. The course is less ideal for
self-study, since you would miss out on classroom discussions. You would not see
the questions and answers, nor the compiler errors we trigger when going through
the code samples. We hope to improve the self-study experience via
[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by
[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).

## Setup

The course is built using a few tools:

- [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)
- [mdbook-svgbob](https://github.com/boozook/mdbook-svgbob)
- [mdbook-i18n-helpers and i18n-report](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers)
- [mdbook-exerciser](mdbook-exerciser/)
- [mdbook-course](mdbook-course/)
- [mdbook-linkcheck2](https://github.com/marxin/mdbook-linkcheck2)

First, install Rust by following the instructions on https://rustup.rs/. Then
clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/
cd comprehensive-rust
```

Then run the following command to install the correct versions of all tools
mentioned above:

```shell
cargo xtask install-tools
```

This uses `cargo install` to install the tools, so you will find them in your
`~/.cargo/bin/` directory afterwards.

## Commands

Here are some of the commonly used commands you can run in the project. Run
`cargo xtask` to view all available commands.

| Command                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `cargo xtask web-tests`     | Run the web driver tests in the tests directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `cargo xtask build`         | Create a static version of the course in the `book/` directory. Note that you have to separately build and zip exercises and add them to book/html. To build any of the translated versions of the course, add the language flag (--language or -l) followed by xx, where xx is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. cargo xtask build -l da for the Danish translation). [TRANSLATIONS.md](TRANSLATIONS.md) contains further instructions. |

&gt; **Note** On Windows, you need to enable symlinks
&gt; (`git config --global core.symlinks true`) and Developer Mode.

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

# Vello

**A GPU compute-centric 2D renderer**

&lt;/div&gt;

Vello is a 2D graphics rendering engine written in Rust, with a focus on GPU compute.
It can draw large 2D scenes with interactive or near-interactive performance, using [`wgpu`] for GPU access.

Quickstart to run an example program:

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit
```

![image](https://github.com/linebender/vello/assets/8573618/cc2b742e-2135-4b70-8051-c49aeddb5d19)

It is used as the rendering backend for [Xilem], a Rust GUI toolkit.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Vello can currently be considered in an alpha state. In particular, we&#039;re still working on the following:
&gt;
&gt; - [Implementing blur and filter effects](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/476).
&gt; - [Conflations artifacts](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/49).
&gt; - [GPU memory allocation strategy](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/366)
&gt; - [Glyph caching](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/204)

Significant changes are documented in [the changelog].

## Motivation

Vello is meant to fill the same place in the graphics stack as other vector graphics renderers like [Skia](https://skia.org/), [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), and its predecessor project [Piet](https://github.com/linebender/piet).
On a basic level, that means it provides tools to render shapes, images, gradients, text, etc, using a PostScript-inspired API, the same that powers SVG files and [the browser `&lt;canvas&gt;` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).

Vello&#039;s selling point is that it gets better performance than other renderers by better leveraging the GPU.
In traditional PostScript-style renderers, some steps of the render process like sorting and clipping either need to be handled in the CPU or done through the use of intermediary textures.
Vello avoids this by using prefix-sum algorithms to parallelize work that usually needs to happen in sequence, so that work can be offloaded to the GPU with minimal use of temporary buffers.

This means that Vello needs a GPU with support for compute shaders to run.

## Getting started

Vello is meant to be integrated deep in UI render stacks.
While drawing in a Vello scene is easy, actually rendering that scene to a surface requires setting up a wgpu context, which is a non-trivial task.

To use Vello as the renderer for your PDF reader / GUI toolkit / etc, your code will have to look roughly like this:

```rust
use vello::{
    kurbo::{Affine, Circle},
    peniko::{Color, Fill},
    *,
};

// Initialize wgpu and get handles
let (width, height) = ...;
let device: wgpu::Device = ...;
let queue: wgpu::Queue = ...;
let mut renderer = Renderer::new(
   &amp;device,
   RendererOptions::default()
).expect(&quot;Failed to create renderer&quot;);
// Create scene and draw stuff in it
let mut scene = vello::Scene::new();
scene.fill(
   vello::peniko::Fill::NonZero,
   vello::Affine::IDENTITY,
   vello::Color::from_rgb8(242, 140, 168),
   None,
   &amp;vello::Circle::new((420.0, 200.0), 120.0),
);
// Draw more stuff
scene.push_layer(...);
scene.fill(...);
scene.stroke(...);
scene.pop_layer(...);
let texture = device.create_texture(&amp;...);

// Render to a wgpu Texture
renderer
   .render_to_texture(
      &amp;device,
      &amp;queue,
      &amp;scene,
      &amp;texture,
      &amp;vello::RenderParams {
         base_color: palette::css::BLACK, // Background color
         width,
         height,
         antialiasing_method: AaConfig::Msaa16,
      },
   )
   .expect(&quot;Failed to render to a texture&quot;);
// Do things with `texture`, such as blitting it to the Surface using
// wgpu::util::TextureBlitter
```

See the [`examples`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) directory for code that integrates with frameworks like winit.

## Performance

We&#039;ve observed 177 fps for the paris-30k test scene on an M1 Max, at a resolution of 1600 pixels square, which is excellent performance and represents something of a best case for the engine.

More formal benchmarks are on their way.

## Integrations

### SVG

A separate Linebender integration for rendering SVG files is available through [`vello_svg`](https://github.com/linebender/vello_svg).

### Lottie

A separate Linebender integration for playing Lottie animations is available through [`velato`](https://github.com/linebender/velato).

### Bevy

A separate Linebender integration for rendering raw scenes or Lottie and SVG files in [Bevy] through [`bevy_vello`](https://github.com/linebender/bevy_vello).

## Examples

Our examples are provided in separate packages in the [`examples`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) directory.
This allows them to have independent dependencies and faster builds.
Examples must be selected using the `--package` (or `-p`) Cargo flag.

### Winit

Our [winit] example ([examples/with_winit](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples/with_winit)) demonstrates rendering to a [winit] window.
By default, this renders the [GhostScript Tiger] as well as all SVG files you add in the [examples/assets/downloads](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples/assets/downloads) directory.
A custom list of SVG file paths (and directories to render all SVG files from) can be provided as arguments instead.
It also includes a collection of test scenes showing the capabilities of `vello`, which can be shown with `--test-scenes`.

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit
```

&lt;!-- ### Headless --&gt;

## Platforms

We aim to target all environments which can support WebGPU with the [default limits](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#limits).
We defer to [`wgpu`] for this support.
Other platforms are more tricky, and may require special building/running procedures.

### Web

Because Vello relies heavily on compute shaders, we rely on the emerging WebGPU standard to run on the web.
Browser support for WebGPU is still evolving.
Vello has been tested using production versions of Chrome, but WebGPU support in Firefox and Safari is still experimental.
It may be necessary to use development browsers and explicitly enable WebGPU.

The following command builds and runs a web version of the [winit demo](#winit).
This uses [`cargo-run-wasm`](https://github.com/rukai/cargo-run-wasm) to build the example for web, and host a local server for it

```shell
# Make sure the Rust toolchain supports the wasm32 target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# The binary name must also be explicitly provided as it differs from the package name
cargo run_wasm -p with_winit --bin with_winit_bin
```

There is also a web demo [available here](https://linebender.github.io/vello) on supporting web browsers.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The web is not currently a primary target for Vello, and WebGPU implementations are incomplete, so you might run into issues running this example.

### Android

The [`with_winit`](#winit) example supports running on Android, using [cargo apk](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk).

```shell
cargo apk run -p with_winit --lib
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; cargo apk doesn&#039;t support running in release mode without configuration.
&gt; See [their crates page docs](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk) (around `package.metadata.android.signing.&lt;profile&gt;`).
&gt;
&gt; See also [cargo-apk#16](https://github.com/rust-mobile/cargo-apk/issues/16).
&gt; To run in release mode, you must add the following to `examples/with_winit/Cargo.toml` (changing `$HOME` to your home directory):

```toml
[package.metadata.android.signing.release]
path = &quot;$HOME/.android/debug.keystore&quot;
keystore_password = &quot;android&quot;
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; As `cargo apk` does not allow passing command line arguments or environment variables to the app when ran, these can be embedded into the
&gt; program at compile time (currently for Android only)
&gt; `with_winit` currently supports the environment variables:
&gt;
&gt; - `VELLO_STATIC_LOG`, which is equivalent to `RUST_LOG`
&gt; - `VELLO_STATIC_ARGS`, which is equivalent to passing in command line arguments

For example (with unix shell environment variable syntax):

```sh
VELLO_STATIC_LOG=&quot;vello=trace&quot; VELLO_STATIC_ARGS=&quot;--test-scenes&quot; cargo apk run -p with_winit --lib
```

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.86** and later.

Future versions of Vello might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click here if compiling fails.&lt;/summary&gt;

As time has passed, some of Vello&#039;s dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don&#039;t want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency&#039;s name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## History

Vello was previously known as `piet-gpu`.
This prior incarnation used a custom cross-API hardware abstraction layer, called `piet-gpu-hal`, instead of [`wgpu`].

An archive of this version can be found in the branches [`custom-hal-archive-with-shaders`] and [`custom-hal-archive`].
This succeeded the previous prototype, [piet-metal], and included work adapted from [piet-dx12].

The decision to lay down `piet-gpu-hal` in favor of WebGPU is discussed in detail in the blog post [Requiem for piet-gpu-hal].

A [vision](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/doc/vision.md) document dated December 2020 explained the longer-term goals of the project, and how we might get there.
Many of these items are out-of-date or completed, but it still may provide some useful background.

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).

`just` is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

This readme is also available as a [book](https://just.systems/man/en/). The
book reflects the latest release, whereas the
[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.md)
reflects latest master.

(‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£Âú® [ËøôÈáå](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.‰∏≠Êñá.md),
Âø´ÁúãËøáÊù•!)

Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax
inspired by `make`:

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/screenshot.png)

You can then run them with `just RECIPE`:

```console
$ just test-all
cc *.c -o main
./test --all
Yay, all your tests passed!
```

`just` has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over `make`:

- `just` is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of
  [`make`&#039;s complexity and idiosyncrasies](#what-are-the-idiosyncrasies-of-make-that-just-avoids).
  No need for `.PHONY` recipes!

- Linux, MacOS, Windows, and other reasonable unices are supported with no
  additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn&#039;t have an `sh`,
  you&#039;ll need to [choose a different shell](#shell).)

- Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along
  with their source context.

- Recipes can accept [command line arguments](#recipe-parameters).

- Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and
  circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.

- `just` [loads `.env` files](#dotenv-settings), making it easy to populate
  environment variables.

- Recipes can be [listed from the command line](#listing-available-recipes).

- Command line completion scripts are
  [available for most popular shells](#shell-completion-scripts).

- Recipes can be written in
  [arbitrary languages](#shebang-recipes), like Python or NodeJS.

- `just` can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that
  contains the `justfile`.

- And [much more](https://just.systems/man/en/)!

If you need help with `just` please feel free to open an issue or ping me on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/ezYScXR). Feature requests and bug reports are
always welcome!

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

`just` should run on any system with a reasonable `sh`, including Linux, MacOS,
and the BSDs.

#### Windows

On Windows, `just` works with the `sh` provided by
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com),
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), or
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com). After installation, `sh` must be
available in the `PATH` of the shell you want to to invoke `just` from.

If you&#039;d rather not install `sh`, you can use the `shell` setting to use the
shell of your choice.

Like PowerShell:

```just
# use PowerShell instead of sh:
set shell := [&quot;powershell.exe&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;]

hello:
  Write-Host &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
```

‚Ä¶or `cmd.exe`:

```just
# use cmd.exe instead of sh:
set shell := [&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;/c&quot;]

list:
  dir
```

You can also set the shell using command-line arguments. For example, to use
PowerShell, launch `just` with `--shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c`.

(PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2
S1 and later, and `cmd.exe` is quite fiddly, so PowerShell is recommended for
most Windows users.)

### Packages

#### Cross-platform

      &lt;td&gt;just&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;arkade get just&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

### Pre-Built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows can be found on
[the releases page](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).

You can use the following command on Linux, MacOS, or Windows to download the
latest release, just replace `DEST` with the directory where you&#039;d like to put
`just`:

```console
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to DEST
```

For example, to install `just` to `~/bin`:

```console
# create ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/bin

# download and extract just to ~/bin/just
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin

# add `~/bin` to the paths that your shell searches for executables
# this line should be added to your shells initialization file,
# e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$HOME/bin&quot;

# just should now be executable
just --help
```

Note that `install.sh` may fail on GitHub Actions, or in other environments
where many machines share IP addresses. `install.sh` calls GitHub APIs in order
to determine the latest version of `just` to install, and those API calls are
rate-limited on a per-IP basis. To make `install.sh` more reliable in such
circumstances, pass a specific tag to install with `--tag`.

Another way to avoid rate-limiting is to pass a GitHub authentication token to
`install.sh` as an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`, allowing it to
authenticate its requests.

[Releases](https://github.com/casey/just/releases) include a `SHA256SUM` file
which can be used to verify the integrity of pre-built binary archives.

To verify a release, download the pre-built binary archive along with the
`SHA256SUM` file and run:

```sh
shasum --algorithm 256 --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
```

### GitHub Actions

`just` can be installed on GitHub Actions in a few ways.

Using package managers pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners on MacOS with
`brew install just`, and on Windows with `choco install just`.

With [extractions/setup-just](https://github.com/extractions/setup-just):

```yaml
- uses: extractions/setup-just@v3
  with:
    just-version: 1.5.0  # optional semver specification, otherwise latest
```

Or with [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action):

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/install-action@just
```

### Release RSS Feed

An [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of `just` releases is available [here](https://github.com/casey/just/releases.atom).

### Node.js Installation

[just-install](https://npmjs.com/package/just-install) can be used to automate
installation of `just` in Node.js applications.

`just` is a great, more robust alternative to npm scripts. If you want to
include `just` in the dependencies of a Node.js application, `just-install`
will install a local, platform-specific binary as part of the `npm install`
command. This removes the need for every developer to install `just`
independently using one of the processes mentioned above. After installation,
the `just` command will work in npm scripts or with npx. It&#039;s great for teams
who want to make the set up process for their project as easy as possible.

For more information, see the
[just-install README file](https://github.com/brombal/just-install#readme).

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

With the release of version 1.0, `just` features a strong commitment to
backwards compatibility and stability.

Future releases will not introduce backwards incompatible changes that make
existing `justfile`s stop working, or break working invocations of the
command-line interface.

This does not, however, preclude fixing outright bugs, even if doing so might
break `justfiles` that rely on their behavior.

There will never be a `just` 2.0. Any desirable backwards-incompatible changes
will be opt-in on a per-`justfile` basis, so users may migrate at their
leisure.

Features that aren&#039;t yet ready for stabilization are marked as unstable and may
be changed or removed at any time. Using unstable features produces an error by
default, which can be suppressed with by passing the `--unstable` flag,
`set unstable`, or setting the environment variable `JUST_UNSTABLE`, to any
value other than `false`, `0`, or the empty string.

Editor Support
--------------

`justfile` syntax is close enough to `make` that you may want to tell your
editor to use `make` syntax highlighting for `just`.

### Vim and Neovim

Vim version 9.1.1042 or better and Neovim version 0.11 or better support
Justfile syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to
[pbnj](https://github.com/pbnj).

#### `vim-just`

The [vim-just](https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just) plugin provides syntax
highlighting for `justfile`s.

Install it with your favorite package manager, like
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
call plug#begin()

Plug &#039;NoahTheDuke/vim-just&#039;

call plug#end()
```

Or with Vim&#039;s built-in package support:

```console
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
git clone https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just.git
```

#### `tree-sitter-just`

[tree-sitter-just](https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just) is an
[Nvim Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin
for Neovim.

#### Makefile Syntax Highlighting

Vim&#039;s built-in makefile syntax highlighting isn&#039;t perfect for `justfile`s, but
it&#039;s better than nothing. You can put the following in `~/.vim/filetype.vim`:

```vimscript
if exists(&quot;did_load_filetypes&quot;)
  finish
endif

augroup filetypedetect
  au BufNewFile,BufRead justfile setf make
augroup END
```

Or add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on a
per-file basis:

```text
# vim: set ft=make :
```

### Emacs

[just-mode](https://github.com/leon-barrett/just-mode.el) provides syntax
highlighting and automatic indentation of `justfile`s. It is available on
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/) as [just-mode](https://melpa.org/#/just-mode).

[justl](https://github.com/psibi/justl.el) provides commands for executing and
listing recipes.

You can add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on
a per-file basis:

```text
# Local Variables:
# mode: makefile
# End:
```

### Visual Studio Code

An extension for VS Code is [available here](https://github.com/nefrob/vscode-just).

Unmaintained VS Code extensions include
[skellock/vscode-just](https://github.com/skellock/vscode-just) and
[sclu1034/vscode-just](https://github.com/sclu1034/vscode-just).

### JetBrains IDEs

A plugin for JetBrains IDEs by [linux_china](https://github.com/linux-china) is
[available here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18658-just).

### Kakoune

Kakoune supports `justfile` syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to
TeddyDD.

### Helix

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) supports `justfile` syntax highlighting
out-of-the-box since version 23.05.

### Sublime Text

The [Just package](https://github.com/nk9/just_sublime) by
[nk9](https://github.com/nk9) with `just` syntax and some other tools is
available on [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Just).

### Micro

[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) supports Justfile syntax highlighting
out of the box, thanks to [tomodachi94](https://github.com/tomodachi94).

### Zed

The [zed-just](https://github.com/jackTabsCode/zed-just/) extension by
[jackTabsCode](https://github.com/jackTabsCode) is avilable on the
[Zed extensions page](https://zed.dev/extensions?query=just).

### Other Editors

Feel free to send me the commands necessary to get syntax highlighting working
in your editor of choice so that I may include them here.

### Model Context Protocol

[just-mcp](http://github.com/promptexecution/just-mcp) provides a
[model context protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)
adapter to allow LLMs to query the contents of `justfiles` and run recipes.

Quick Start

A Minecraft 1.20.4 creative server built for redstone. Each 512x512 plot runs on a separate thread, allowing for less lag, more concurrency, and many awesome extra features!

MCHPRS is very different from traditional servers. Because this server is tailored to the use of computation redstone, many things that are a part of Vanilla Minecraft servers don&#039;t exist here. That being said, MCHPRS comes with many of its own unique features.

MCHPRS has made it possible to run programs such as [a limited form of Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BP7DhHTU-I) on CPUs in Minecraft. To accomplish these speeds, we created [Redpiler](docs/Redpiler.md), the &quot;Redstone Compiler&quot;.

## Building

If the Rust compiler is not already installed, you can find out how [on their official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRS.git
cd MCHPRS
cargo build --release
```

Once complete, the optimized executable will be located at `./target/release/mchprs` or `./target/release/mchprs.exe` depending on your operating system.

## Configuration

MCHPRS will generate a `Config.toml` file in the current working directory when starting the server if it does not exist.

The folowing options are available at the toplevel (under no header):
| Field | Description | Default |
| --- | --- |--- |
| `bind_address` | Bind address and port | `0.0.0.0:25565` |
| `motd` | Message of the day | `&quot;Minecraft High Performance Redstone Server&quot;` |
| `chat_format` | How to format chat message interpolating `username` and `message` with curly braces | `&lt;{username}&gt; {message}` |
| `max_players` | Maximum number of simultaneous players | `99999` |
| `view_distance` | Maximal distance (in chunks) between players and loaded chunks | `8` |
| `whitelist` | Whether or not the whitelist (in `whitelist.json`) shoud be enabled | `false` |
| `schemati` | Mimic the verification and directory layout used by the Open Redstone Engineers [Schemati plugin](https://github.com/OpenRedstoneEngineers/Schemati) | `false` |
| `block_in_hitbox` | Allow placing blocks inside of players (hitbox logic is simplified) | `true` |
| `auto_redpiler` | Use redpiler automatically | `false` |

To change the plot size edit the constants defined in [plot/mod.rs](./crates/core/src/plot/mod.rs).

### Velocity

MCHPRS has no support for player authentication on its own, but supports Velocity modern ip-forwarding.

To use [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) ip-forwarding, you must have a Velocity proxy set up and configured. Make sure `player-info-forwarding-mode` is set to `modern` in your Velocity config. Then, append this to your `Config.toml`:

```toml
[velocity]
enabled = true
# This is the secret contained within `forwarding-secret-file` from your velocity config,
# NOT the path to the file.
secret = &quot;&lt;secret&gt;&quot;
```

### LuckPerms

MCHPRS has basic support for LuckPerms with MySQL or MariaDB remote database storage. This implementation has no commands or interface and would have to be manged through LuckPerms running on a proxy (`/lpb`) or other server (`/lp`)

To use LuckPerms, append this to your `Config.toml`:

```toml
[luckperms]
# Define the address for the database.
host = &quot;localhost&quot;
# The name of the database the LuckPerms data is in.
db_name = &quot;minecraft&quot;
# Credentials for the database.
username = &quot;minecraft&quot;
password = &quot;minecraft&quot;
# The name of the server, used for server specific permissions.
# See: https://luckperms.net/wiki/Context
server_context = &quot;global&quot;
```

## Usage

### General Commands
| Command | Alias | Description |

| `/radvance [ticks]` | `/radv` | Advances the plot by `[ticks]` redstone ticks. |
| `/teleport [player]` | `/tp` | Teleports you to `[player]`. |
| `/teleport [x] [y] [z]` | `/tp` | Teleports you to `[x] [y] [z]`. Supports relative coordinates. Floats can be expressed as described [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html#grammar). |
| `/speed [speed]` | None | Sets your flyspeed. |
| `/gamemode [mode]` | `/gmc`, `/gmsp` | Sets your gamemode. |
| `/container [type] [power]` | None | Gives you a container (e.g. barrel) which outputs a specified amount of power when used with a comparator. |
| `/toggleautorp` | None | Toggles automatic redpiler compilation. |
| `/stop` | None | Stops the server. |

### Plot Ownership
The plot ownership system in MCHPRS is very incomplete.
These are the commands that are currently implemented:
| Command | Alias | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |
| `/plot info` | `/p i` | Gets the owner of the plot you are in. |
| `/plot claim` | `/p c` | Claims the plot you are in if it is not already claimed. |
| `/plot auto` | `/p a` | Automatically finds an unclaimed plot and claims. |
| `/plot middle` | None | Teleports you to the center of the plot you are in. |
| `/plot visit [player]` | `/p v` | Teleports you to a player&#039;s plot. |
| `/plot tp [x] [z]` | None | Teleports you to the plot at `[x] [y]`. Supports relative coordinates. |
| `/plot lock` | None | Locks the player into the plot so moving outside of the plot bounds does not transfer you to other plots. |
| `/plot unlock` | None | Reverses the locking done by `/plot lock`. |
| `/plot select` | `/p sel` | Uses WorldEdit to select the entire plot. |

### Redpiler

MCHPRS provides Redpiler, the redstone compiler. This allows redstone simulation much faster than otherwise possible.
While redpiler is running, all redstone connections are pre-computed, thus interaction with the world is limited in this state.
Placing or breaking blocks while redpiler is running will cause a reset and disable redpiler.

| Command | Alias | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/redpiler compile` | `/rp c` | Manually starts redpiler compilation. There are several flags available, described below. |
| `/redpiler reset` | `/rp r` | Stops redpiler. |

| Flag | Short | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--optimize` | `-o` | Enable redpiler optimizations. WARNING: This can, and will, break the state of your build. Use backups when using this flag. |
| `--io-only` | `-i` | Only send blocks updates of relavent input/output blocks. This includes trapdoors, lamps, note blocks, buttons, levers, and pressure plates. Using this flag can significantly reduce lag and improve simulation speed. |
| `--wire-dot-out` | `-d` | Consider wires in the dot shape as an output block for `-i`. Useful for e.g. color displays. |
| `--update` | `-u` | Update all blocks after redpiler resets. |
| `--export` | `-e` | Export the compile graph using a binary format. This can be useful for developing out-of-tree uses of redpiler graphs. |
| `--export-dot` | None | Create a graphvis dot file of backend graph. Used for debugging/development. |
