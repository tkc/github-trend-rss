## Yazi - ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üîå **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- üì° **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- üì¶ **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- üß∞ Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- üîÑ Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- üé® Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

A secure, stable and high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal, written in Rust

rathole, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

&lt;!-- /TOC --&gt;

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections. See [Benchmark](#benchmark)
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. See [Benchmark](#benchmark). [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `rathole` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**. A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapiz1/rathole) is also available.

The usage of `rathole` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `rathole`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # `2333` specifies the port that rathole listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:5202&quot; # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;myserver.com:2333&quot; # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot; # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client&#039;s port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `rathole` run as a background service on Linux, checkout the [systemd examples](./examples/systemd).

## Configuration

`rathole` can automatically determine to run in the server mode or the client mode, according to the content of the configuration file, if only one of `[server]` and `[client]` block is present, like the example in [Quickstart](#quickstart).

But the `[client]` and `[server]` block can also be put in one file. Then on the server side, run `rathole --server config.toml` and on the client side, run `rathole --client config.toml` to explicitly tell `rathole` the running mode.

Before heading to the full configuration specification, it&#039;s recommend to skim [the configuration examples](./examples) to get a feeling of the configuration format.

See [Transport](./docs/transport.md) for more details about encryption and the `transport` block.

Here is the full configuration specification:

```toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;example.com:2333&quot; # Necessary. The address of the server
default_token = &quot;default_token_if_not_specify&quot; # Optional. The default token of services, if they don&#039;t define their own ones
heartbeat_timeout = 40 # Optional. Set to 0 to disable the application-layer heartbeat test. The value must be greater than `server.heartbeat_interval`. Default: 40 seconds
retry_interval = 1 # Optional. The interval between retry to connect to the server. Default: 1 second

[client.transport] # The whole block is optional. Specify which transport to use
type = &quot;tcp&quot; # Optional. Possible values: [&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;tls&quot;, &quot;noise&quot;]. Default: &quot;tcp&quot;

[client.transport.tcp] # Optional. Also affects `noise` and `tls`
proxy = &quot;socks5://user:passwd@127.0.0.1:1080&quot; # Optional. The proxy used to connect to the server. `http` and `socks5` is supported.
nodelay = true # Optional. Determine whether to enable TCP_NODELAY, if applicable, to improve the latency but decrease the bandwidth. Default: true
keepalive_secs = 20 # Optional. Specify `tcp_keepalive_time` in `tcp(7)`, if applicable. Default: 20 seconds
keepalive_interval = 8 # Optional. Specify `tcp_keepalive_intvl` in `tcp(7)`, if applicable. Default: 8 seconds

[client.transport.tls] # Necessary if `type` is &quot;tls&quot;
trusted_root = &quot;ca.pem&quot; # Necessary. The certificate of CA that signed the server&#039;s certificate
hostname = &quot;example.com&quot; # Optional. The hostname that the client uses to validate the certificate. If not set, fallback to `client.remote_addr`

[client.transport.noise] # Noise protocol. See `docs/transport.md` for further explanation
pattern = &quot;Noise_NK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s&quot; # Optional. Default value as shown

### Logging

`rathole`, like many other Rust programs, use environment variables to control the logging level. `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace` are available.

```shell
RUST_LOG=error ./rathole config.toml
```

will run `rathole` with only error level logging.

If `RUST_LOG` is not present, the default logging level is `info`.

### Tuning

From v0.4.7, rathole enables TCP_NODELAY by default, which should benefit the latency and interactive applications like rdp, Minecraft servers. However, it slightly decreases the bandwidth.

If the bandwidth is more important, TCP_NODELAY can be opted out with `nodelay = false`.

## Benchmark

rathole has similar latency to [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), but can handle a more connections, provide larger bandwidth, with less memory usage.

For more details, see the separate page [Benchmark](./docs/benchmark.md).

**However, don&#039;t take it from here that `rathole` can magically make your forwarded service faster several times than before.** The benchmark is done on local loopback, indicating the performance when the task is cpu-bounded. One can gain quite a improvement if the network is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not true for many users. In that case, the main benefit is lower resource consumption, while the bandwidth and the latency may not improved significantly.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ÀàdiÀêno ä/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant
preview, you can also check out [Typst&#039;s free web app][app].

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /ta…™pst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

&lt;/p&gt;

Difftastic is a structural diff tool that compares files based on
their syntax.

**For installation instructions, see
[Installation](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/installation.html) in
[the manual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/).**

## Basic Example

![Screenshot of difftastic and JS](img/js.png)

In this JavaScript example, we can see:

(1) Difftastic understands nesting. It highlights the matching `{` and
`}`, but understands that `foo()` hasn&#039;t changed despite the leading
whitespace.

(2) Difftastic understands which lines should be aligned. It&#039;s aligned
`bar(1)` on the left with `bar(2)` on the right, even though the
textual content isn&#039;t identical.

(3) Difftastic understands that line-wrapping isn&#039;t
meaningful. `&quot;eric&quot;` is now on a new line, but it hasn&#039;t changed.

## One Minute Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/480875.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/480875)

This one minute screencast demonstrates difftastic usage with both
standalone files and git.

## Languages

Difftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.

If a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a
textual diff with word highlighting.

## Known Issues

Performance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large
number of changes, and can use a lot of memory.

Display. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can
be confusing.

Robustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.

## Non-goals

Patching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it
does not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you
need a patch.

(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for
difftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same
line, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old
and new file.)

Merging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not
address.

## FAQ

### Isn&#039;t this basically `--word-diff --ignore-all-space`?

Word diffing [can&#039;t do
this](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1510139929971421191/photo/1).

Difftastic parses your code. It understands when whitespace matters,
such as inside string literals or languages like Python. It understands
that `x-1` is three tokens in JS but one token in Lisp.

### Can I use difftastic with git?

You can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git
usage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it
[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).

If you&#039;re an Emacs user, check out [this blog
post](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)
showing one way to use difftastic with magit, as well as
[difftastic.el](https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el).

### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?

Probably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your
favourite tool, and I will link it in the README!

### What about parse errors?

By default, difftastic falls back to a line-oriented diff whenever
parse errors are encountered.

This is a conservative choice to ensure that difftastic never claims
two syntactically different files are the same.

Parse errors can occur if the file uses language features that the
parser does not understand, if the language relies on a preprocessor
before parsing (e.g. C++), or if the file has genuine syntactic
mistakes.

In practice, difftastic virtually always produces a good result when
there are a few minor parse errors. Consider allowing a small number
of parse errors when using difftastic.

```
$ export DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT=20
$ difft foo1.c foo2.c
```

### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?

Yes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers
(i.e. `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`).

Pass your file with conflicts as a single argument to
difftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and
diff those.

```
$ difft file_with_conflicts.js
```

### Can difftastic do merges?

No. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.

AST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text
diff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn&#039;t syntactically
significant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.

The [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on
a tree-sitter AST however.

### Can difftastic ignore reordering?

No. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing
e.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.

If you&#039;re diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them
to difftastic.

```
$ difft &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_1.json) &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_2.json)
```

See also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data
Types](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)
in the manual.

### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?

Yes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without
calculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and
useful for building tools that check for changes.

For example:

```
$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js
```

This will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or
1 if there are changes found.

### Why aren&#039;t colours appearing in my terminal?

Difftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal
themes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that
does this.

If you&#039;re a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to
disable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.

### How does it work?

Difftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses
Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm.

My [blog
post](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)
describes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it), supports video thumbnails

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome.

You can help by creating:

- Bug reports - memory leaks, unexpected behavior, crashes
- Feature proposals - proposal to change/add/delete some features
- Pull Requests - implementing a new feature yourself or fixing bugs.
  If the change is bigger, then it&#039;s a good idea to open a new issue to discuss changes, but issues with
  label `PR welcome` are already checked and accepted.
- Documentation - There is an [instruction](instructions/Instruction.md) which you can improve.
- Translations - Instruction how to translate files is available [here](instructions/Translations.md)
- External contributions - App use big number of external libraries
  like [lofty](https://github.com/Serial-ATA/lofty-rs), [image-rs](https://github.com/image-rs/image)
  or [symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia) so improving this libraries will automatically improve Czkawka

## Thanks

Big thanks to P√°draig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

&lt;/div&gt;

Buck2 is a fast, hermetic, multi-language build system, and a direct successor
to the original [Buck build system](https://buck.build) (&quot;Buck1&quot;) &amp;mdash; both
designed by Meta.

But what do those words really mean for a build system &amp;mdash; and why might
they interest you? &quot;But why Buck2?&quot; you might ask, when so many build systems
already exist?

- **Fast**. It doesn&#039;t matter whether a single build command takes 60 seconds to
  complete, or 0.1 seconds: when you have to build things, Buck2 doesn&#039;t waste
  time &amp;mdash; it calculates the critical path and gets out of the way, with
  minimal overhead. It&#039;s not just the core design, but also careful attention to
  detail that makes Buck2 so snappy. Buck2 is up to 2x faster than Buck1 _in
  practice_[^perf-note]. So you spend more time iterating, and less time
  waiting.
- **Hermetic**. When using Remote Execution[^hermetic-re-only], Buck2 becomes
  _hermetic_: it is required for a build rule to correctly declare all of its
  inputs; if they aren&#039;t specified correctly (e.g. a `.c` file needs a `.h` file
  that isn&#039;t correctly specified), the build will fail. This enforced
  correctness helps avoids entire classes of errors that most build systems
  allow, and helps ensure builds work everywhere for all users. And Buck2
  correctly tracks dependencies with far better accuracy than Buck1, in more
  languages, across more scenarios. That means &quot;it compiles on my machine&quot; can
  become a thing of the past.
- **Multi-language**. Many teams have to deal with multiple programming
  languages that have complex inter-dependencies, and struggle to express that.
  Most people settle with `make` and tie together `dune` to `pip` and `cargo`.
  But then how do you run test suites, code coverage, or query code databases?
  Buck2 is designed to support multiple languages from the start, with
  abstractions for interoperation. And because it&#039;s completely scriptable, and
  _users_ can implement language support &amp;mdash; it&#039;s incredibly flexible. Now
  your Python library can depend on an OCaml library, and your OCaml library can
  depend on a Rust crate &amp;mdash; and with a single build tool, you have a
  consistent UX to build and test and integrate all of these components.

[^perf-note]:
    This number comes from internal usage of Buck1 versus Buck2 at Meta. Please
    note that _appropriate_ comparisons with systems like Bazel have yet to be
    performed; Buck1 is the baseline because it&#039;s simply what existed and what
    had to be replaced. Please benchmark Buck2 against your favorite tools and
    let us know how it goes!

[^hermetic-re-only]:
    Buck2 currently does not sandbox _local-only_ build steps; in contrast,
    Buck2 using Remote Execution is _always_ hermetic by design. The vast
    majority of build rules are remote compatible, as well. Despite that, we
    hope to lift this restriction in the (hopefully short-term) future so that
    local-only builds are hermetic as well.

If you&#039;re familiar with systems like Buck1, [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), or
[Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) &amp;mdash; then Buck2 will feel warm and cozy,
and these ideas will be familiar. But then why create Buck2 if those already
exist? Because that isn&#039;t all &amp;mdash; the page
_[&quot;Why Buck2?&quot;](https://buck2.build/docs/about/why/)_ on our website goes into
more detail on several other important design critera that separate Buck2 from
the rest of the pack, including:

- Support for ultra-large repositories, through filesystem virtualization and
  watching for changes to the filesystem.
- Totally language-agnostic core executable, with a small API &amp;mdash; even C/C++
  support is written as a library. You can write everything from scratch, if you
  wanted.
- &quot;Buck Extension Language&quot; (BXL) can be used for self-introspection of the
  build system, allowing automation tools to inspect and run actions in the
  build graph. This allows you to more cleanly support features that need graph
  introspection, like LSPs or compilation databases.
- Support for distributed compilation, using the same Remote Execution API that
  is supported by Bazel. Existing solutions like BuildBarn, BuildBuddy, EngFlow,
  and NativeLink all work today.
- An efficient, robust, and sound design &amp;mdash; inspired by modern theory of
  build systems and incremental computation.
- And more!

If these headline features make you interested &amp;mdash; check out the
[Getting Started](https://buck2.build/docs/getting_started/) guide!

## üößüößüöß **Warning** üößüößüöß &amp;mdash; rough terrain lies ahead

Buck2 currently **does not have a stable release tag at this time**. Pre-release
tags/binaries, and stable tags/binaries, will come at later dates. Despite that,
it is used extensively inside of Meta on vast amounts of code every day, and
[buck2-prelude](/prelude/) is the same code used internally for all these
builds, as well.

Meta just uses the latest committed `HEAD` version of Buck2 at all times. Your
mileage may vary &amp;mdash; but at the moment, tracking `HEAD` is ideal for
submitting bug reports and catching regressions.

The short of this is that you should consider this project and its code to be
battle-tested and working, but outside consumers will encounter quite a lot of
rough edges right now &amp;mdash; several features are missing or in progress, some
toolchains from Buck1 are missing, and you&#039;ll probably have to fiddle with
things more than necessary to get it nice and polished.

Please provide feedback by submitting
[issues and questions!](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues)

## Installing Buck2

You can get started by downloading a
[bi-monthly version](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tags) or the
[latest](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/latest) built binary for
your platform. The `latest` tag always refers to a recent commit; it is updated
on every single push to the GitHub repository, so it will always be a recent
version.

Alternately, you can use [dotslash](https://dotslash-cli.com/) with the
bi-monthly releases where it&#039;s easy to deploy into a repo with a single text
file and auto pull the correct platform as needed.

You can also compile Buck2 from source, if a binary isn&#039;t immediately available
for your use; check out the [HACKING.md](./HACKING.md) file for information.

## Terminology conventions

Frequently used terms and their definitions can be found on the
[glossary page](https://buck2.build/docs/concepts/glossary/).

## License

Buck2 is licensed under both the MIT license and Apache-2.0 license; the exact
terms can be found in the [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) and
[LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) files, respectively.

This repository has the source code for Comprehensive Rust ü¶Ä, a multi-day Rust
course developed by the Android team. The course covers all aspects of Rust,
from basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on
[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].

## Course Format and Target Audience

The course is used internally at Google when teaching Rust to experienced
software engineers. They typically have a background in C++ or Java.

The course is taught in a classroom setting and we hope it will be useful for
others who want to teach Rust to their team. The course will be less useful for
self-study since you miss out on the discussions happening in the classroom. You
don&#039;t see the questions and answers and you don&#039;t see the compiler errors we
trigger when going through the code samples. We hope to improve on this via
[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by
[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).

| `cargo xtask build`         | Create a static version of the course in the `book/` directory. Note that you have to separately build and zip exercises and add them to book/html. To build any of the translated versions of the course, run MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=xx mdbook build -d book/xx where xx is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. da for the Danish translation). [TRANSLATIONS.md](TRANSLATIONS.md) contains further instructions. |

&gt; **Note** On Windows, you need to enable symlinks
&gt; (`git config --global core.symlinks true`) and Developer Mode.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee¬†PC¬†900 from¬†2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, ‚Ä¶)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

## What does this do?

This is a cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and Windows.
A short summary of the features:

- multiple layers of key functionality
- advanced key behaviour customization (e.g. tap-hold, macros, unicode)

To see all of the features, see the [configuration guide](./docs/config.adoc).

You can find pre-built binaries in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
or read on for build instructions.

You can see a [list of known issues here](./docs/platform-known-issues.adoc).

### Demo

#### Demo video
[Showcase of multi-layer functionality (30s, 1.7 MB)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6634136/183001314-f64a7e26-4129-4f20-bf26-7165a6e02c38.mp4).

#### Online simulator

You can check out the [online simulator](https://jtroo.github.io)
to test configuration validity and test input simulation.

## Why is this useful?

Imagine if, instead of pressing Shift to type uppercase letters, we had giant
keyboards with separate keys for lowercase and uppercase letters. I hope we can
all agree: that would be a terrible user experience!

A way to think of how Shift keys work is that they switch your input to another
layer of functionality where you now type uppercase letters and symbols
instead of lowercase letters and numbers.

What kanata allows you to do is take this alternate layer concept that Shift
keys have and apply it to any key. You can then customize what those layers do
to suit your exact needs and workflows.

## Usage

Running kanata currently does not start it in a background process.
You will need to keep the window that starts kanata running to keep kanata active.
Some tips for running kanata in the background:

- Windows: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/193
- Linux: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130#discussioncomment-10227272
- Run from tray icon: [kanata-tray](https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray)

### Pre-built executables

See the
[releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
for executables and instructions.

### Build it yourself

This project uses the latest Rust stable toolchain. If you installed the
Rust toolchain using `rustup`, e.g. by using the instructions from the
[official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started),
you can get the latest stable toolchain with `rustup update stable`.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

Using `cargo install`:

    cargo install kanata

    # On Linux and macOS, this may not work without `sudo`, see below
    kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is used because kanata opens /dev/ files
    #
    # See below if you want to avoid needing sudo:
    # https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/wiki/Avoid-using-sudo-on-Linux
    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Windows.

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive
    target\debug\kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in macOS:

First install the Karabiner driver by following the macOS documentation
in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/).

Then you can compile and run with the instructions below:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is needed to gain permission to intercept the keyboard

    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

The full configuration guide is [found here](./docs/config.adoc).

Sample configuration files are found in [cfg_samples](./cfg_samples). The
[simple.kbd](./cfg_samples/simple.kbd) file contains a basic configuration file
that is hopefully easy to understand but does not contain all features. The
`kanata.kbd` contains an example of all features with documentation. The
release assets also have a `kanata.kbd` file that is tested to work with that
release. All key names can be found in the [keys module](./src/keys/mod.rs),
and you can also define your own key names.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Feature flags

When either building yourself or using `cargo install`,
you can add feature flags that
enable functionality that is turned off by default.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

If you want to enable the `cmd` actions,
add the flag `--features cmd`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd
cargo install --features cmd
```

On Windows,
if you want to compile a binary that uses the Interception driver,
you should add the flag `--features interception_driver`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features interception_driver
cargo install --features interception_driver
```

To combine multiple flags,
use a single `--features` flag
and use a comma to separate the features.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd,interception_driver
cargo install --features cmd,interception_driver
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## What does the name mean?

I wanted a &quot;k&quot; word since this relates to keyboards. According to Wikipedia,
kanata is an indigenous Iroquoian word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; and is
the origin of Canada&#039;s name.

There&#039;s also PPT‚úß.

## Motivation

TLDR: QMK features but for any keyboard, not just fancy mechanical ones.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Long version&lt;/summary&gt;

I have a few keyboards that run [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/). QMK allows the
user to customize the functionality of their keyboard to their heart&#039;s content.

One great use case of QMK is its ability map keys so that they overlap with the
home row keys but are accessible on another layer. I won&#039;t comment on
productivity, but I find this greatly helps with my keyboard comfort.

For example, these keys are on the right side of the keyboard:

    7 8 9
    u i o
    j k l
    m , .

On one layer I have arrow keys in the same position, and on another layer I
have a numpad.

    arrows:       numpad:
    - - -         7 8 9
    - ‚Üë -         4 5 6
    ‚Üê ‚Üì ‚Üí         1 2 3
    - - -         0 * .

One could add as many customizations as one likes to improve comfort, speed,
etc. Personally my main motivator is comfort due to a repetitive strain injury
in the past.

However, QMK doesn&#039;t run everywhere. In fact, it doesn&#039;t run on **most**
hardware you can get. You can&#039;t get it to run on a laptop keyboard or any
mainstream office keyboard. I believe that the comfort and empowerment QMK
provides should be available to anyone with a computer on their existing
hardware, instead of having to purchase an enthusiast mechanical keyboard
(which are admittedly very nice ‚Äî I own a few ‚Äî but can be costly).

The best alternative solution that I found for keyboards that don&#039;t run QMK was
[kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad). This is an excellent project
and I recommend it if you want to try something similar.

The reason for this project&#039;s existence is that kmonad is written in Haskell
and I have no idea how to begin contributing to a Haskell project. From an
outsider&#039;s perspective I think Haskell is a great language but I really can&#039;t
wrap my head around it. And there are a few [outstanding issues](./docs/kmonad_comparison.md)
at the time of writing that make kmonad suboptimal for my personal workflows.

This project is written in Rust because Rust is my favourite programming
language and the prior work of the awesome [keyberon crate](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon)
exists.
&lt;/details&gt;

### Why the list?

While kanata is the best tool for some, it may not be the best tool for
you. I&#039;m happy to introduce you to tools that may better suit your needs. This
list is also useful as reference/inspiration for functionality that could be
added to kanata.
