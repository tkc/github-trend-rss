## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

you get involved in the project. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## FAQ

#### How do you pronounce uv?

It&#039;s pronounced as &quot;you - vee&quot; ([`/juÀê viÀê/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key))

#### How should I stylize uv?

Just &quot;uv&quot;, please. See the [style guide](./STYLE.md#styling-uv) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [üìñ Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[‚†ä] Compiling...
[‚†î] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[‚†í] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[‚†ä] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, Œº: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[‚†ä] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
‚ûú uint256 a = 123;
‚ûú a
Type: uint256
‚îú Hex: 0x7b
‚îú Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
‚îî Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic ‚Äî with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting ‚Äî enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust‚Äôs rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically ‚Äî
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)‚Äîno Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; ‚ÄúThe intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.‚Äù

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren‚Äôt officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ‚úì       | ‚úì       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ‚úì       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ‚úì       | ‚úì       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ‚úì       | ‚úì       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.221.0a20250912` for September 12, 2025):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.221.0a20250912 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; On Linux, confirm your glibc version with `ldd --version` and ensure it reports **2.35** or newer before installing binary wheels.

#### Branch updates

- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Build and publish continuously with every merged commit.
- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Build and publish daily whe

## What is iroh?

Iroh gives you an API for dialing by public key.
You say ‚Äúconnect to that phone‚Äù, iroh will find &amp; maintain the fastest connection for you, regardless of where it is.

### Hole-punching

The fastest route is a direct connection, so if necessary, iroh tries to hole-punch.
Should this fail, it can fall back to an open ecosystem of public relay servers.
To ensure these connections are as fast as possible, we [continuously measure iroh][iroh-perf].

### Built on [QUIC]

Iroh uses [Quinn] to establish [QUIC] connections between endpoints.
This way you get authenticated encryption, concurrent streams with stream priorities, a datagram transport and avoid head-of-line-blocking out of the box.

## Compose Protocols

Use pre-existing protocols built on iroh instead of writing your own:
- [iroh-blobs] for [BLAKE3]-based content-addressed blob transfer scaling from kilobytes to terabytes
- [iroh-gossip] for establishing publish-subscribe overlay networks that scale, requiring only resources that your average phone can handle
- [iroh-docs] for an eventually-consistent key-value store of [iroh-blobs] blobs
- [iroh-willow] for an (in-construction) implementation of the [willow protocol]

## Getting Started

### Rust Library

It&#039;s easiest to use iroh from rust.
Install it using `cargo add iroh`, then on the connecting side:

```rs
const ALPN: &amp;[u8] = b&quot;iroh-example/echo/0&quot;;

let endpoint = Endpoint::bind().await?;

// Open a connection to the accepting endpoint
let conn = endpoint.connect(addr, ALPN).await?;

// Open a bidirectional QUIC stream
let (mut send, mut recv) = conn.open_bi().await?;

// Send some data to be echoed
send.write_all(b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;).await?;
send.finish()?;

// Receive the echo
let response = recv.read_to_end(1000).await?;
assert_eq!(&amp;response, b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

// As the side receiving the last application data - say goodbye
conn.close(0u32.into(), b&quot;bye!&quot;);

// Close the endpoint and all its connections
endpoint.close().await;
```

And on the accepting side:
```rs
let endpoint = Endpoint::bind().await?;

let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
    .accept(ALPN.to_vec(), Arc::new(Echo))
    .spawn()
    .await?;

// The protocol definition:
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Echo;

impl ProtocolHandler for Echo {
    async fn accept(&amp;self, connection: Connection) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let (mut send, mut recv) = connection.accept_bi().await?;

        // Echo any bytes received back directly.
        let bytes_sent = tokio::io::copy(&amp;mut recv, &amp;mut send).await?;

        send.finish()?;
        connection.closed().await;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

The full example code with more comments can be found at [`echo.rs`][echo-rs].

Or use one of the pre-existing protocols, e.g. [iroh-blobs] or [iroh-gossip].

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world&#039;s code and human engineers now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Easily switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Quickly review work and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server

You can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).

## Installation

Make sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

## Documentation

Please head to the [website](https://vibekanban.com/docs) for the latest documentation and user guides.

## Support

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) for feature requests. Please open a discussion to create a feature request. For bugs please open an issue on this repo.

## Contributing

We would prefer that ideas and changes are first raised with the core team via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) or Discord, where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (&gt;=18)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (&gt;=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the backend. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Building the frontend

To build just the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

### Build from source

1. Run `build-npm-package.sh`
2. In the `npx-cli` folder run `npm pack`
3. You can run your build with `npx [GENERATED FILE].tgz`


### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | Build-time | `Ov23li9bxz3kKfPOIsGm` | GitHub OAuth app client ID for authentication |
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend development server port |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable git worktree cleanup (for debugging) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Custom GitHub OAuth App (Optional)

By default, Vibe Kanban uses Bloop AI&#039;s GitHub OAuth app for authentication. To use your own GitHub app for self-hosting or custom branding:

1. Create a GitHub OAuth App at [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Enable &quot;Device Flow&quot; in the app settings
3. Set scopes to include `user:email,repo`
4. Build with your client ID:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here pnpm run build
   ```

### Remote Deployment

When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:

1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI
2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings ‚Üí Editor Integration:
   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP
   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server
   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)
   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension

When configured, the &quot;Open in VSCode&quot; buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.

See the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.

## ‚öì Oxc

_/o ä …õks siÀê/_

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Oxc is part of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/)&#039;s vision for a unified, high-performance toolchain for JavaScript. It powers [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) ([Vite]&#039;s future bundler) and enables the next generation of ultra-fast development tools that work seamlessly together.

For more information, check out our website at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs).

&lt;sub&gt;* Oxidation is the chemical process that creates rust&lt;/sub&gt;

## üèóÔ∏è Design Principles

- **Performance**: Through rigorous performance engineering.
- **Correctness**: Through conformance testing to standards and similar projects.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and sensible configuration.
- **Modular composability**: Use individual components independently or compose them into complete toolchains.

# Time-aware multimodal data stack and visualizations
Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It&#039;s used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

Rerun is easy to use!
Use the Rerun SDK (available for C++, Python and Rust) to log data like images, tensors, point clouds, and text.
Logs are streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.
You can also query the logged data through [our dataframe API](https://rerun.io/docs/howto/dataframe-api).

[Get started](#getting-started) in minutes ‚Äì no account needed.

* [Run the Rerun Viewer in your browser](https://www.rerun.io/viewer)
* [Read about what Rerun is and who it is for](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-rerun)

### A short taste
```py
import rerun as rr  # pip install rerun-sdk

rr.init(&quot;rerun_example_app&quot;)

rr.spawn()  # Spawn a child process with a viewer and connect
# rr.save(&quot;recording.rrd&quot;)  # Stream all logs to disk
# rr.connect_grpc()  # Connect to a remote viewer

# Associate subsequent data with 42 on the ‚Äúframe‚Äù timeline
rr.set_time(&quot;frame&quot;, sequence=42)

# Log colored 3D points to the entity at `path/to/points`
rr.log(&quot;path/to/points&quot;, rr.Points3D(positions, colors=colors))
‚Ä¶
```

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting started
* [**C++**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/cpp)
* [**Python**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python): `pip install rerun-sdk` or on [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock)
* [**Rust**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/rust): `cargo add rerun`

### Installing the Rerun Viewer binary
To stream log data over the network or load our `.rrd` data files you also need the `rerun` binary.
It can be installed with `pip install rerun-sdk` or with `cargo install rerun-cli --locked --features nasm` (see note below).
Note that only the Python SDK comes bundled with the Viewer whereas C++ &amp; Rust always rely on a separate install.

**Note**: the `nasm` Cargo feature requires the [`nasm`](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) CLI to be installed and available in your path.
Alternatively, you may skip enabling this feature, but this may result in inferior video decoding performance.

You should now be able to run `rerun --help` in any terminal.

## Status
We are in active development.
There are many features we want to add, and the API is still evolving.
_Expect breaking changes!_

Some shortcomings:
* [The viewer slows down when there are too many entities](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7115)
* [We don&#039;t support transparency yet](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1611)
* The data you want to visualize must fit in RAM
  - See &lt;https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/limit-ram&gt; for how to bound memory use.
  - We plan on having a disk-based data store some time in the future.
* [Multi-million point clouds can be slow](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1136)


## What is Rerun for?

Rerun is built to help you understand and improve complex processes that include rich multimodal data, like 2D, 3D, text, time series, tensors, etc.
It is used in many industries, including robotics, simulation, computer vision,
or anything that involves a lot of sensors or other signals that evolve over time.

### Example use case
Say you&#039;re building a vacuum cleaning robot and it keeps running into walls. Why is it doing that? You need some tool to debug it, but a normal debugger isn&#039;t gonna be helpful. Similarly, just logging text won&#039;t be very helpful either. The robot may log &quot;Going through doorway&quot; but that won&#039;t explain why it thinks the wall is a door.

What you need is a visual and temporal debugger, that can log all the different representations of the world the robots holds in its little head, such as:

* RGB camera feed
* depth images
* lidar scan
* segmentation image (how the robot interprets what it sees)
* its 3D map of the apartment
* all the objects the robot has detected (or thinks it has detected), as 3D shapes in the 3D map
* its confidence in its prediction
* etc

You also want to see how all these streams of data evolve over time so you can go back and pinpoint exactly what went wrong, when and why.

Maybe it turns out that a glare from the sun hit one of the sensors in the wrong way, confusing the segmentation network leading to bad object detection. Or maybe it was a bug in the lidar scanning code. Or maybe the robot thought it was somewhere else in the apartment, because its odometry was broken. Or it could be one of a thousand other things. Rerun will help you find out!

But seeing the world from the point of the view of the robot is not just for debugging - it will also give you ideas on how to improve the algorithms, new test cases to set up, or datasets to collect. It will also let you explain the brains of the robot to your colleagues, boss, and customers. And so on. Seeing is believing, and an image is worth a thousand words, and multimodal temporal logging is worth a thousand images :)

While seeing and understanding your data is core to making progress in robotics, there is one more thing:
You can also use the data you collected for visualization to create new datasets for training and evaluating the models and algorithms that run on your robot.
Rerun provides query APIs to make it easy to extract clean datasets from your recording for exactly that purpose.

Of course, Rerun is useful for much more than just robots. Any time you have any form of sensors, or 2D or 3D state evolving over time, Rerun is a great tool.


## Business model
Rerun uses an open-core model. Everything in this repository will stay open source and free (both as in beer and as in freedom).

We are also building a commercial data platform.
Right now that is only available for a few select design partners.
[Click here if you&#039;re interested](https://rerun.io/pricing).

The Rerun open source project targets the needs of individual developers.
The commercial product targets the needs specific to teams that build and run computer vision and robotics products.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

### Windows

You can install the latest version with WinGet:
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Edit
```

## Build Instructions

* [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Install the nightly toolchain: `rustup install nightly`
  * Alternatively, set the environment variable `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`
* Clone the repository
* For a release build, run:
  * Rust 1.90 or earlier: `cargo build --config .cargo/release.toml --release`
  * otherwise: `cargo build --config .cargo/release-nightly.toml --release`

### Build Configuration

During compilation you can set various environment variables to configure the build. The following table lists the available configuration options:

Environment variable | Description
--- | ---
`EDIT_CFG_ICU*` | See [ICU library name (SONAME)](#icu-library-name-soname) for details.
`EDIT_CFG_LANGUAGES` | A comma-separated list of languages to include in the build. See [i18n/edit.toml](i18n/edit.toml) for available languages.

## Notes to Package Maintainers

### Package Naming

The canonical executable name is &quot;edit&quot; and the alternative name is &quot;msedit&quot;.
We&#039;re aware of the potential conflict of &quot;edit&quot; with existing commands and recommend alternatively naming packages and executables &quot;msedit&quot;.
Names such as &quot;ms-edit&quot; should be avoided.
Assigning an &quot;edit&quot; alias is recommended, if possible.

### ICU library name (SONAME)

This project _optionally_ depends on the ICU library for its Search and Replace functionality.
By default, the project will look for a SONAME without version suffix:
* Windows: `icuuc.dll`
* macOS: `libicuuc.dylib`
* UNIX, and other OS: `libicuuc.so`

If your installation uses a different SONAME, please set the following environment variable at build time:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicuuc.so.76`.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicui18n.so.76`.

Additionally, this project assumes that the ICU exports are exported without `_` prefix and without version suffix, such as `u_errorName`.
If your installation uses versioned exports, please set:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_CPP_EXPORTS`:
  If set to `true`, it&#039;ll look for C++ symbols such as `_u_errorName`.
  Enabled by default on macOS.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION`:
  If set to a version number, such as `76`, it&#039;ll look for symbols such as `u_errorName_76`.

Finally, you can set the following environment variables:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_AUTO_DETECT`:
  If set to `true`, the executable will try to detect the `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION` value at runtime.
  The way it does this is not officially supported by ICU and as such is not recommended to be relied upon.
  Enabled by default on UNIX (excluding macOS) if no other options are set.

To test your settings, run `cargo test` again but with the `--ignored` flag. For instance:
```sh
cargo test -- --ignored
```

OpenObserve (O2 for short) is a cloud-native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, RUM (Real User Monitoring - Performance, Errors, Session Replay) designed to work at petabyte scale.

It is straightforward and easy to operate, in contrast to Elasticsearch, which requires understanding and tuning numerous settings. Get OpenObserve up and running in under 2 minutes.

OpenObserve serves as a seamless replacement for Elasticsearch for users who ingest data using APIs and perform searches. OpenObserve comes with its own user interface, eliminating the need for separate installation.

You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch by using OpenObserve. Below, we present the results from pushing logs from our production Kubernetes cluster to both Elasticsearch and OpenObserve using Fluent Bit.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Typst Packages
The package repository for Typst, where package authors submit their packages.
The packages submitted here are available on [Typst Universe][universe].

## Package format

A package is a collection of Typst files and assets that can be imported as a
unit. A `typst.toml` manifest with metadata is required at the root of a
package. [Read more about the manifest format][manifest].

## Published packages

This repository contains a collection of published packages. Due to its early
and experimental nature, all packages in this repository are scoped in a
`preview` namespace. A package that is stored in
`packages/preview/{name}/{version}` in this repository will become available in
Typst as `#import &quot;@preview/{name}:{version}&quot;`. You must always specify the full
package version.

You can use template packages to create new Typst projects with the CLI with
the `typst init` command or the web application by clicking the _Start from
template_ button.

If you want to submit your own package, you can follow [our documentation on
publishing packages][publishing] that will guide you through the process and
give you some tips.

### Downloads

The Typst compiler downloads packages from the `preview` namespace on-demand.
Once used, they are cached in `{cache-dir}/typst/packages/preview` where
`{cache-dir}` is

- `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache` on Linux
- `~/Library/Caches` on macOS
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows

Importing a cached package does not result in network access.

## Local packages

Want to install a package locally on your system without publishing it or
experiment with it before publishing? You can store packages in
`{data-dir}/typst/packages/{namespace}/{name}/{version}` to make them available
locally on your system. Here, `{data-dir}` is

- `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `~/.local/share` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS
- `%APPDATA%` on Windows

You can create an arbitrary `{namespace}`. A good namespace for system-local
packages is `local`. Using this namespace:

- Store a package in `{data-dir}/typst/packages/local/mypkg/1.0.0`

## Features

1. Async

    Relying on [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), SeaORM is a new library with async support from day 1.

2. Dynamic

    Built upon [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query), SeaORM allows you to build complex dynamic queries.

3. Service Oriented

    Quickly build services that join, filter, sort and paginate data in REST, GraphQL and gRPC APIs.

4. Production Ready

    SeaORM is feature-rich, well-tested and used in production by companies and startups.

Let&#039;s have a quick walk through of the unique features of SeaORM.

## Expressive Entity format
You don&#039;t have to write this by hand! Entity files can be generated from an existing database using `sea-orm-cli`,
following is generated with `--entity-format dense` *(new in 2.0)*.
```rust
mod cake {
    use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

    #[sea_orm::model]
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq)]
    #[sea_orm(table_name = &quot;cake&quot;)]
    pub struct Model {
        #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
        pub id: i32,
        pub name: String,
        #[sea_orm(has_one)]
        pub fruit: HasOne&lt;super::fruit::Entity&gt;,
        #[sea_orm(has_many, via = &quot;cake_filling&quot;)] // M-N relation with junction
        pub fillings: HasMany&lt;super::filling::Entity&gt;,
    }
}
mod fruit {
    use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

    #[sea_orm::model]
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq)]
    #[sea_orm(table_name = &quot;fruit&quot;)]
    pub struct Model {
        #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
        pub id: i32,
        pub name: String,
        #[sea_orm(unique)]
        pub cake_id: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
        #[sea_orm(belongs_to, from = &quot;cake_id&quot;, to = &quot;id&quot;)]
        pub cake: HasOne&lt;super::cake::Entity&gt;,
    }
}
```

## Smart Entity Loader
The Entity Loader intelligently uses join for 1-1 and data loader for 1-N relations,
eliminating the N+1 problem even when performing nested queries.
```rust
// join paths:
// cake -&gt; fruit
// cake -&gt; cake_filling -&gt; filling
//                         filling -&gt; ingredient
let super_cake = cake::Entity::load()
    .filter_by_id(42) // shorthand for .filter(cake::Column::Id.eq(42))
    .with(fruit::Entity) // 1-1 uses join
    .with((filling::Entity, ingredient::Entity)) // 1-N uses data loader
    .one(db)
    .await?
    .unwrap();

// 3 queries are executed under the hood:
// 1. SELECT FROM cake JOIN fruit WHERE id = $
// 2. SELECT FROM filling JOIN cake_filling WHERE cake_id IN (..)
// 3. SELECT FROM ingredient WHERE filling_id IN (..)

super_cake
    == cake::ModelEx {
        id: 42,
        name: &quot;Black Forest&quot;.into(),
        fruit: HasOne::Loaded(
            fruit::ModelEx {
                name: &quot;Cherry&quot;.into(),
            }
            .into(),
        ),
        fillings: HasMany::Loaded(vec![filling::ModelEx {
            name: &quot;Chocolate&quot;.into(),
            ingredients: HasMany::Loaded(vec![ingredient::ModelEx {
                name: &quot;Syrup&quot;.into(),
            }]),
        }]),
    };
```

## Schema first or Entity first? Your choice

SeaORM provides a powerful migration system that lets you create tables, modify schemas, and seed data with ease.

With SeaORM 2.0, you also get a first‚Äëclass [Entity First Workflow](https://www.sea-ql.org/blog/2025-10-30-sea-orm-2.0/):
simply define new entities or add columns to existing ones,
and SeaORM will automatically detect the changes and create the new tables, columns, unique keys, and foreign keys.

```rust
// SeaORM resolves foreign key dependencies and creates the tables in topological order.
// Requires the `entity-registry` and `schema-sync` feature flags.
db.get_schema_registry(&quot;my_crate::entity::*&quot;).sync(db).await;
```

## Ergonomic Raw SQL

Let SeaORM handle 95% of your transactional queries.
For the remaining cases that are too complex to express,
SeaORM still offers convenient support for writing raw SQL.
```rust
let item = Item { name: &quot;Chocolate&quot; }; // nested parameter access
let ids = [2, 3, 4]; // expanded by the `..` operator

let cake: Option&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find()
    .from_raw_sql(raw_sql!(
        Sqlite,
        r#&quot;SELECT &quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot; FROM &quot;cake&quot;
           WHERE &quot;name&quot; LIKE {item.name}
           AND &quot;id&quot; in ({..ids})
        &quot;#
    ))
    .one(db)
    .await?;
```

## Basics

### Select
SeaORM models 1-N and M-N relationships at the Entity level,
letting you traverse many-to-many links through a junction table in a single call.
```rust
// find all models
let cakes: Vec&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find().all(db).await?;

// find and filter
let chocolate: Vec&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find()
    .filter(cake::Column::Name.contains(&quot;chocolate&quot;))
    .all(db)
    .await?;

// find one model
let cheese: Option&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let cheese: cake::Model = cheese.unwrap();

// find related models (lazy)
let fruit: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = cheese.find_related(Fruit).one(db).await?;

// find related models (eager): for 1-1 relations
let cake_with_fruit: Vec&lt;(cake::Model, Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt;)&gt; =
    Cake::find().find_also_related(Fruit).all(db).await?;

// find related models (eager): works for both 1-N and M-N relations
let cake_with_fillings: Vec&lt;(cake::Model, Vec&lt;filling::Model&gt;)&gt; = Cake::find()
    .find_with_related(Filling) // for M-N relations, two joins are performed
    .all(db) // rows are automatically consolidated by left entity
    .await?;
```
### Nested Select

Partial models prevent overfetching by letting you querying only the fields
you need; it also makes writing deeply nested relational queries simple.
```rust
use sea_orm::DerivePartialModel;

#[derive(DerivePartialModel)]
#[sea_orm(entity = &quot;cake::Entity&quot;)]
struct CakeWithFruit {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    #[sea_orm(nested)]
    fruit: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt;, // this can be a regular or another partial model
}

let cakes: Vec&lt;CakeWithFruit&gt; = Cake::find()
    .left_join(fruit::Entity) // no need to specify join condition
    .into_partial_model() // only the columns in the partial model will be selected
    .all(db)
    .await?;
```

### Insert
SeaORM&#039;s ActiveModel lets you work directly with Rust data structures and
persist them through a simple API.
It&#039;s easy to insert large batches of rows from different data sources.
```rust
let apple = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set(&quot;Apple&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default() // no need to set primary key
};

let pear = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set(&quot;Pear&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// insert one: Active Record style
let apple = apple.insert(db).await?;
apple.id == 1;

// insert one: repository style
let result = Fruit::insert(apple).exec(db).await?;
result.last_insert_id == 1;

// insert many returning last insert id
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear]).exec(db).await?;
result.last_insert_id == Some(2);
```

### Insert (advanced)
You can take advantage of database specific features to perform upsert and idempotent insert.
```rust
// insert many with returning (if supported by database)
let models: Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .exec_with_returning(db)
    .await?;
models[0]
    == fruit::Model {
        id: 1, // database assigned value
        name: &quot;Apple&quot;.to_owned(),
        cake_id: None,
    };

// insert with ON CONFLICT on primary key do nothing, with MySQL specific polyfill
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .on_conflict_do_nothing()
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

matches!(result, TryInsertResult::Conflicted);
```

### Update
ActiveModel avoids race conditions by updating only the fields you&#039;ve changed,
never overwriting untouched columns.
You can also craft complex bulk update queries with a fluent query building API.
```rust
use fruit::Column::CakeId;
use sea_orm::sea_query::{Expr, Value};

let pear: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let mut pear: fruit::ActiveModel = pear.unwrap().into();

pear.name = Set(&quot;Sweet pear&quot;.to_owned()); // update value of a single field

// update one: only changed columns will be updated
let pear: fruit::Model = pear.update(db).await?;

// update many: UPDATE &quot;fruit&quot; SET &quot;cake_id&quot; = &quot;cake_id&quot; + 2
//               WHERE &quot;fruit&quot;.&quot;name&quot; LIKE &#039;%Apple%&#039;
Fruit::update_many()
    .col_expr(CakeId, Expr::col(CakeId).add(Expr::val(2)))
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains(&quot;Apple&quot;))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;
```
### Save
You can perform &quot;insert or update&quot; operation with ActiveModel, making it easy to compose transactional operations.
```rust
let banana = fruit::ActiveModel {
    id: NotSet,
    name: Set(&quot;Banana&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// create, because primary key `id` is `NotSet`
let mut banana = banana.save(db).await?;

banana.id == Unchanged(2);
banana.name = Set(&quot;Banana Mongo&quot;.to_owned());

// update, because primary key `id` is present
let banana = banana.save(db).await?;
```
### Delete
The same ActiveModel API consistent with insert and update.
```rust
// delete one: Active Record style
let orange: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();
orange.delete(db).await?;

// delete one: repository style
let orange = fruit::ActiveModel {
    id: Set(2),
    ..Default::default()
};
fruit::Entity::delete(orange).exec(db).await?;

// delete many: DELETE FROM &quot;fruit&quot; WHERE &quot;fruit&quot;.&quot;name&quot; LIKE &#039;%Orange%&#039;
fruit::Entity::delete_many()
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains(&quot;Orange&quot;))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

```
### Raw SQL Query
The `raw_sql!` macro is like the `format!` macro but without the risk of SQL injection.
It supports nested parameter interpolation, array and tuple expansion, and even repeating group,
offering great flexibility in crafting complex queries.

```rust
#[derive(FromQueryResult)]
struct CakeWithBakery {
    name: String,
    #[sea_orm(nested)]
    bakery: Option&lt;Bakery&gt;,
}

#[derive(FromQueryResult)]
struct Bakery {
    #[sea_orm(alias = &quot;bakery_name&quot;)]
    name: String,
}

let cake_ids = [2, 3, 4]; // expanded by the `..` operator

// can use many APIs with raw SQL, including nested select
let cake: Option&lt;CakeWithBakery&gt; = CakeWithBakery::find_by_statement(raw_sql!(
    Sqlite,
    r#&quot;SELECT &quot;cake&quot;.&quot;name&quot;, &quot;bakery&quot;.&quot;name&quot; AS &quot;bakery_name&quot;
       FROM &quot;cake&quot;
       LEFT JOIN &quot;bakery&quot; ON &quot;cake&quot;.&quot;bakery_id&quot; = &quot;bakery&quot;.&quot;id&quot;
       WHERE &quot;cake&quot;.&quot;id&quot; IN ({..cake_ids})&quot;#
))
.one(db)
.await?;
```

Pyrefly is a type checker and language server for Python, which provides
lightning-fast type checking along with IDE features such as code navigation,
semantic highlighting, and code completion. It is available as a
[command-line tool](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) and a
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly).

See the [Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org) for full documentation and how to
add Pyrefly to your editor of choice.

Currently under active development with known issues. Please open an issue if
you find bugs.

### Getting Started

- Try out pyrefly in your browser: [Sandbox](https://pyrefly.org/sandbox/)
- Get the command-line tool: `pip install pyrefly`
- Get the VSCode extension:
  [Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly)

### Key Features:

- Type Inference: Pyrefly infers types in most locations, apart from function
  parameters. It can infer types of variables and return types.
- Flow Types: Pyrefly can understand your program&#039;s control flow to refine
  static types.
- Incrementality: Pyrefly aims for large-scale incrementality at the module
  level, with optimized checking and parallelism.

## Getting Involved

and types. This is also where we hold biweekly office hours.

## Choices

There are a number of choices when writing a Python type checker. We are taking
inspiration from [Pyre1](https://pyre-check.org/),
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Some notable choices:

- We infer types in most locations, apart from parameters to functions. We do
  infer types of variables and return types. As an example,
  `def foo(x): return True` would result in something equivalent to had you
  written `def foo(x: Any) -&gt; bool: ...`.
- We attempt to infer the type of `[]` to however it is used first, then fix it
  after. For example `xs = []; xs.append(1); xs.append(&quot;&quot;)` will infer that
  `xs: List[int]` and then error on the final statement.
- We use flow types which refine static types, e.g. `x: int = 4` will both know
  that `x` has type `int`, but also that the immediately next usage of `x` will
  be aware the type is `Literal[4]`.
- We aim for large-scale incrementality (at the module level) and optimized
  checking with parallelism, aiming to use the advantages of Rust to keep the
  code a bit simpler.
- We expect large strongly connected components of modules, and do not attempt
  to take advantage of a DAG-shape in the source code.

## Code layout

Pyrefly is split into a number of crates (mostly under `crates/`):

- `pyrefly_util` are general purpose utilities, which have nothing to do with
  Python or type checking. Examples include IO wrappers, locking, command line
  helpers etc.
- `pyrefly_derive` are proc-macros for deriving traits such as `TypeEq` and
  `Visit`.
- `pyrefly_python` are Python utilities with no type-checking aspects, such as
  modelling modules or `sys.info`.
- `pyrefly_bundled` are the third-party
  [typeshed stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
- `pyrefly_config` defines the Pyrefly configuration, along with support for
  reading Mypy/Pyright configuration.
- `pyrefly_types` defines the Pyrefly type along with operations on it.
- `pyrefly_wasm` defines the sandbox code that compiles to WASM.
- `pyrefly` itself is the type checker and everything else.

## Design

There are many nuances of design that change on a regular basis. But the basic
substrate on which the checker is built involves three steps:

1. Figure out what each module exports. That requires solving all `import *`
   statements transitively.
2. For each module in isolation, convert it to bindings, dealing with all
   statements and scope information (both static and flow).
3. Solve those bindings, which may require the solutions of bindings in other
   modules.

If we encounter unknowable information (e.g. recursion) we use `Type::Var` to
insert placeholders which are filled in later.

For each module, we solve the steps sequentially and completely. In particular,
we do not try and solve a specific identifier first (like
[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), and do not use fine-grained
incrementality (like [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
using [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)). Instead, we aim for raw
performance and a simpler module-centric design - there&#039;s no need to solve a
single binding in isolation if solving all bindings in a module is fast enough.

### Example of bindings

Given the program:

```python
1: x: int = 4
2: print(x)
```

We might produce the bindings:

- `define int@0` = `from builtins import int`
- `define x@1` = `4: int@0`
- `use x@2` = `x@1`
- `anon @2` = `print(x@2)`
- `export x` = `x@2`

Of note:

- The keys are things like `define` (the definition of something), `use` (a
  usage of a thing) and `anon` (a statement we need to type check, but don&#039;t
  care about the result of).
- In many cases the value of a key refers to other keys.
- Some keys are imported from other modules, via `export` keys and `import`
  values.
- In order to disambiguate identifiers we use the textual position at which they
  occur (in the example we&#039;ve used `@line`, but in reality it&#039;s the byte offset
  in the file).

### Example of `Var`

Given the program:

```python
1: x = 1
2: while test():
3:     x = x
4: print(x)
```

We end up with the bindings:

- `x@1` = `1`
- `x@3` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`
- `x@4` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`

The expression `phi` is the join point of the two values, e.g. `phi(int, str)`
would be `int | str`. We skip the distinction between `define` and `use`, since
it is not necessary for this example.

When solving `x@3` we encounter recursion. Operationally:

- We start solving `x@3`.
- That requires us to solve `x@1`.
- We solve `x@1` to be `Literal[1]`
- We start solving `x@3`. But we are currently solving `x@3`, so we invent a
  fresh `Var` (let&#039;s call it `?1`) and return that.
- We conclude that `x@3` must be `Literal[1] | ?1`.
- Since `?1` was introduced by `x@3` we record that `?1 = Literal[1] | ?1`. We
  can take the upper reachable bound of that and conclude that
  `?1 = Literal[1]`.
- We simplify `x@3` to just `Literal[1]`.

[tg-url]: https://t.me/ethrex_client

## Getting started

For instructions on how to get started using ethrex L1 and/or L2, please refer to the [&quot;Getting started&quot; section of the docs](https://docs.ethrex.xyz/getting-started/index.html).

## L1 and L2 support

This client supports running in two different modes:

- As a regular Ethereum execution client
- As a multi-prover ZK-Rollup (supporting SP1, RISC Zero and TEEs), where block execution is proven and the proof sent to an L1 network for verification, thus inheriting the L1&#039;s security. Support for based sequencing is currently in the works.

We call the first one ethrex L1 and the second one ethrex L2.

## Philosophy

Many long-established clients accumulate bloat over time. This often occurs due to the need to support legacy features for existing users or through attempts to implement overly ambitious software. The result is often complex, difficult-to-maintain, and error-prone systems.

In contrast, our philosophy is rooted in simplicity. We strive to write minimal code, prioritize clarity, and embrace simplicity in design. We believe this approach is the best way to build a client that is both fast and resilient. By adhering to these principles, we will be able to iterate fast and explore next-generation features early, either from the Ethereum roadmap or from innovations from the L2s.

Read more about our engineering philosophy [in this post of our blog](https://blog.lambdaclass.com/lambdas-engineering-philosophy/).

## Design Principles

- Ensure effortless setup and execution across all target environments.
- Be vertically integrated. Have the minimal amount of dependencies.
- Be structured in a way that makes it easy to build on top of it, i.e rollups, vms, etc.
- Have a simple type system. Avoid having generics leaking all over the codebase.
- Have few abstractions. Do not generalize until you absolutely need it. Repeating code two or three times can be fine.
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability over premature optimizations.
- Avoid concurrency split all over the codebase. Concurrency adds complexity. Only use where strictly necessary.

---

Warpgate is a smart &amp; fully transparent SSH, HTTPS, MySQL and PostgreSQL bastion host that doesn&#039;t require a client app or an SSH wrapper.

* Set it up in your DMZ, add user accounts and easily assign them to specific hosts and URLs within the network.
* Warpgate will record every session for you to view (live) and replay later through a built-in admin web UI.
* Not a jump host - forwards connection straight to the target in a way that&#039;s fully transparent to the client.
* Native 2FA and SSO support (TOTP &amp; OpenID Connect)
* Single binary with no dependencies.
* Written in 100% safe Rust.

## Getting started &amp; downloads

* See the [Getting started](https://warpgate.null.page/getting-started/) docs page (or [Getting started on Docker](https://warpgate.null.page/getting-started-on-docker/)).
* [Release / beta binaries](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/releases)
* [Nightly builds](https://nightly.link/warp-tech/warpgate/workflows/build/main)

## Reporting security issues

Please use GitHub&#039;s [vulnerability reporting system](https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/security/policy).

## Project Status

The project is ready for production.

## How it works

Warpgate is a service that you deploy on the bastion/DMZ host, which will accept SSH, HTTPS, MySQL and PostgreSQL connections and provide an (optional) web admin UI.

Run `warpgate setup` to interactively generate a config file, including port bindings. See [Getting started](https://warpgate.null.page/getting-started/) for details.

It receives connections with specifically formatted credentials, authenticates the user locally, connects to the target itself, and then connects both parties together while (optionally) recording the session.

When connecting through HTTPS, Warpgate presents a selection of available targets, and will then proxy all traffic in a session to the selected target. You can switch between targets at any time.

You manage the target and user lists and assign them to each other through the admin UI, and the session history is stored in an SQLite database (default: in `/var/lib/warpgate`).

You can also use the admin web interface to view the live session list, review session recordings, logs and more.

## Contributing / building from source

* You&#039;ll need Rust, NodeJS and NPM
* Clone the repo
* [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) is used to run tasks - install it: `cargo install just`
* Install the admin UI deps: `just npm install`
* Build the frontend: `just npm run build`
* Build Warpgate: `cargo build` (optionally `--release`)

The binary is in `target/{debug|release}`.

### Tech stack

* Rust ü¶Ä
  * HTTP: `poem-web`
  * Database: SQLite via `sea-orm` + `sqlx`
  * SSH: `russh`
* Typescript
  * Svelte
  * Bootstrap

### Backend API

* Warpgate admin and user facing APIs use autogenerated OpenAPI schemas and SDKs. To update the SDKs after changing the query/response structures, run `just openapi-all`.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># cs2-dumper

An external offset/interface dumper for Counter-Strike 2, with support for both Windows &amp; Linux. Powered
by [memflow](https://github.com/memflow/memflow).

The native Linux version is available in the [linux](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/tree/linux) branch (currently
outdated).

For a work-in-progress offline version, check out the [cs2-analyzer](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-analyzer) repository or
view its included web demo [here](https://a2x.github.io/cs2-analyzer).

## Getting Started

You can download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/releases) or compile it yourself.
Note that compiling it yourself requires your Rust compiler version to be at least 1.74.0 or newer.

## Usage

1. Ensure the game is running (Being in the main menu should suffice).
2. Run the `cs2-dumper` executable.

_Note:_ If you run the executable without specifying an optional memflow connector name, it will automatically use the
[memflow-native](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-native) OS layer to read the memory of the game process. If you
wish to use an existing memflow connector instead, such as **pcileech** or **kvm**, you can pass the `connector` and
optional `connector-args` arguments to the program. These connectors can be installed and managed using
the [memflowup](https://github.com/memflow/memflowup) tool.

E.g (for pcileech). `cs2-dumper -c pcileech -a :device=FPGA -vv`

Certain connectors, such as the [kvm](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-kvm) connector on Linux or
the [pcileech](https://github.com/memflow/memflow-pcileech) / [winio](https://github.com/a2x/memflow-winio)
connectors on Windows, require elevated privileges to work. So either run the `cs2-dumper` executable with `sudo` on
Linux or as an administrator on Windows.

### Available Arguments

- `-c, --connector &lt;connector&gt;`: The name of the memflow connector to use.
- `-a, --connector-args &lt;connector-args&gt;`: Additional arguments to pass to the memflow connector.
- `-f, --file-types &lt;file-types&gt;`: The types of files to generate. Default: `cs`, `hpp`,  `json`, `rs`.
- `-i, --indent-size &lt;indent-size&gt;`: The number of spaces to use per indentation level. Default: `4`.
- `-o, --output &lt;output&gt;`: The output directory to write the generated files to. Default: `output`.
- `-p, --process-name &lt;process-name&gt;`: The name of the game process. Default: `cs2.exe`.
- `-v...`: Increase logging verbosity. Can be specified multiple times.
- `-h, --help`: Print help.
- `-V, --version`: Print version.

## Running Tests

To run the few basic provided tests, use the following command: `cargo test -- --nocapture`.

# RMCP
[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rmcp)](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp)
&lt;!-- ![Release status](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg) --&gt;
&lt;!-- [![docs.rs](todo)](todo) --&gt;
![Coverage](docs/coverage.svg)

An official Rust Model Context Protocol SDK implementation with tokio async runtime.

This repository contains the following crates:

- [rmcp](crates/rmcp): The core crate providing the RMCP protocol implementation (If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp](crates/rmcp/README.md))
- [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros): A procedural macro crate for generating RMCP tool implementations (If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros/README.md))

## Usage

### Import the crate

```toml
rmcp = { version = &quot;0.8.0&quot;, features = [&quot;server&quot;] }
## or dev channel
rmcp = { git = &quot;https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk&quot;, branch = &quot;main&quot; }
```
### Third Dependencies
Basic dependencies:
- [tokio required](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
- [serde required](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)



### Build a Client
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start a client&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use rmcp::{ServiceExt, transport::{TokioChildProcess, ConfigureCommandExt}};
use tokio::process::Command;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = ().serve(TokioChildProcess::new(Command::new(&quot;npx&quot;).configure(|cmd| {
        cmd.arg(&quot;-y&quot;).arg(&quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything&quot;);
    }))?).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### Build a Server

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a transport&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use tokio::io::{stdin, stdout};
let transport = (stdin(), stdout());
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a service&lt;/summary&gt;

You can easily build a service by using [`ServerHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/server.rs) or [`ClientHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/client.rs).

```rust, ignore
let service = common::counter::Counter::new();
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start the server&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
// this call will finish the initialization process
let server = service.serve(transport).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Interact with the server&lt;/summary&gt;

Once the server is initialized, you can send requests or notifications:

```rust, ignore
// request
let roots = server.list_roots().await?;

// or send notification
server.notify_cancelled(...).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Waiting for service shutdown&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
let quit_reason = server.waiting().await?;
// or cancel it
let quit_reason = server.cancel().await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;Linting the CPython codebase from scratch.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- ‚ö°Ô∏è 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- üêç Installable via `pip`
- üõ†Ô∏è `pyproject.toml` support
- ü§ù Python 3.14 compatibility
- ‚öñÔ∏è Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- üì¶ Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- üîß Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- üìè Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ‚å®Ô∏è First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors) for [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- üåé Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23431#issuecomment-1302557034), lead developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) (also [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028)):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

### Installation

Ruff is available as [`ruff`](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) on PyPI.

Invoke Ruff directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```shell
uvx ruff check   # Lint all files in the current directory.
uvx ruff format  # Format all files in the current directory.
```

Or install Ruff with `uv` (recommended), `pip`, or `pipx`:

```shell
# With uv.
uv tool install ruff@latest  # Install Ruff globally.
uv add --dev ruff            # Or add Ruff to your project.

# With pip.
pip install ruff

# With pipx.
pipx install ruff
```

Starting with version `0.5.0`, Ruff can be installed with our standalone installers:

```shell
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/install.ps1 | iex&quot;

# For a specific version.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/0.14.3/install.sh | sh
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/0.14.3/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.14.3
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.
