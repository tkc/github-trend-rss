![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Layout.html#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config
- Works with [screen readers](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Accessibility.html)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

# librespot
*librespot* is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables applications to use Spotify&#039;s service to control and play music via various backends, and to act as a Spotify Connect receiver. It is an alternative to the official and [now deprecated](https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/#libspotify-s-deprecation) closed-source `libspotify`. Additionally, it will provide extra features which are not available in the official library.

_Note: librespot only works with Spotify Premium. This will remain the case. We will not support any features to make librespot compatible with free accounts, such as limited skips and adverts._

## Quick start
We&#039;re available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/librespot) as the _librespot_ package. Simply run `cargo install librespot` to install librespot on your system. Check the wiki for more info and possible [usage options](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).

After installation, you can run librespot from the CLI using a command such as `librespot -n &quot;Librespot Speaker&quot; -b 160` to create a speaker called _Librespot Speaker_ serving 160 kbps audio.

## This fork
As the origin by [plietar](https://github.com/plietar/) is no longer actively maintained, this organisation and repository have been set up so that the project may be maintained and upgraded in the future.

# Documentation
Documentation is currently a work in progress, contributions are welcome!

There is some brief documentation on how the protocol works in the [docs](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/tree/master/docs) folder.

[COMPILING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md) contains detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, and compiling librespot. More general usage and compilation information is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki).
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) also contains our contributing guidelines.

If you wish to learn more about how librespot works overall, the best way is to simply read the code, and ask any questions you have in our [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/librespot-org/spotify-connect-resources).

# Issues &amp; Discussions
**We have recently started using Github discussions for general questions and feature requests, as they are a more natural medium for such cases, and allow for upvoting to prioritize feature development. Check them out [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/discussions). Bugs and issues with the underlying library should still be reported as issues.**

If you run into a bug when using librespot, please search the existing issues before opening a new one. Chances are, we&#039;ve encountered it before, and have provided a resolution. If not, please open a new one, and where possible, include the backtrace librespot generates on crashing, along with anything we can use to reproduce the issue, e.g. the Spotify URI of the song that caused the crash.

# Building
A quick walkthrough of the build process is outlined below, while a detailed compilation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/COMPILING.md).

## Additional Dependencies
We recently switched to using [Rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) for audio playback by default, hence for macOS and Windows, you should just be able to clone and build librespot (with the command below).
For Linux, you will need to run the additional commands below, depending on your distro.

On Debian/Ubuntu, the following command will install these dependencies:
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev
```

On Fedora systems, the following command will install these dependencies:
```shell
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel make gcc
```

librespot currently offers the following selection of [audio backends](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends):
```
Rodio (default)
ALSA
GStreamer
PortAudio
PulseAudio
JACK
JACK over Rodio
SDL
Pipe
Subprocess
```
Please check [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md) for detailed information on TLS, audio, and discovery backend dependencies, or the [Compiling](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies) entry on the wiki for additional backend specific dependencies.

Once you&#039;ve installed the dependencies and cloned this repository you can build *librespot* with the default features using Cargo.
```shell
cargo build --release
```

By default, this builds with native-tls (system TLS), rodio audio backend, and libmdns discovery. See [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md) for information on selecting different TLS, audio, and discovery backends.

# Packages

librespot is also available via official package system on various operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD. [Repology](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions) offers a good overview.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/librespot.svg)](https://repology.org/project/librespot/versions)

## Usage
A sample program implementing a headless Spotify Connect receiver is provided.
Once you&#039;ve built *librespot*, run it using :
```shell
target/release/librespot --name DEVICENAME
```

The above is a minimal example. Here is a more fully fledged one:
```shell
target/release/librespot -n &quot;Librespot&quot; -b 320 -c ./cache --enable-volume-normalisation --initial-volume 75 --device-type avr
```
The above command will create a receiver named ```Librespot```, with bitrate set to 320 kbps, initial volume at 75%, with volume normalisation enabled, and the device displayed in the app as an Audio/Video Receiver. A folder named ```cache``` will be created/used in the current directory, and be used to cache audio data and credentials.

A full list of runtime options is available [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).

_Please Note: When using the cache feature, an authentication blob is stored for your account in the cache directory. For security purposes, we recommend that you set directory permissions on the cache directory to `700`._

[English] | [简体中文]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

## Community

### Forum

Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: https://forum.atuin.sh/

### Discord

Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here](https://discord.gg/jR3tfchVvW)

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

# Security

If you find any security issues, we&#039;d appreciate it if you could alert ellie@atuin.sh

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codex CLI&lt;/strong&gt; is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer.
&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;If you are looking for the &lt;em&gt;cloud-based agent&lt;/em&gt; from OpenAI, &lt;strong&gt;Codex Web&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/codex&quot;&gt;chatgpt.com/codex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

If you&#039;re running into upgrade issues with Homebrew, see the [FAQ entry on brew upgrade codex](./docs/faq.md#brew-upgrade-codex-isnt-upgrading-me).

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you&#039;re having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex can access MCP servers. To configure them, refer to the [config docs](./docs/config.md#mcp_servers).

### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

## Goals

uutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

Our key objectives include:
- Matching GNU&#039;s output (stdout and error code) exactly
- Better error messages
- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)
- Improved performances
- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

Use [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

To build SELinux-specific features, including `chcon` and `runcon`, ensure that `libselinux` 
and `libclang` are installed on your system. Then, run the following command:
```
cargo build --release --features unix,feat_selinux
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you want to build the utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible:

```shell
cargo build --release --bins --workspace --exclude coreutils --exclude uu_runcon --exclude uu_chcon
```
Each utility is contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build selected individual utilities, use the `--package` [aka `-p`] option. For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `uudoc` binary generates completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells to stdout.

Install `uudoc` by
```shell
cargo install --bin uudoc --features uudoc --path .
```

Then use the installed binary:
```shell
uudoc completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
uudoc completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls.bash
```

Completion for prefixed `cp` with `uu-` on `zsh` is generated by
```shell
env PROG_PREFIX=uu- uudoc completion cp zsh
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
uudoc manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
uudoc manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

## API

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!
    ids=[&quot;doc1&quot;, &quot;doc2&quot;], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=[&quot;This is a query document&quot;],
    n_results=2,
    # where={&quot;metadata_field&quot;: &quot;is_equal_to_this&quot;}, # optional filter
    # where_document={&quot;$contains&quot;:&quot;search_string&quot;}  # optional filter
)
```

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

To find out more see the [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), look
in the [docs/content](docs/content) folder of this repository or visit the [Zola community forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and its template engine [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for editor and markdown components using Tree Sitter.

## Showcase

Here is the first application: [Longbridge Pro](https://longbridge.com/desktop), built using GPUI Component.

&lt;img width=&quot;1763&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ecb9c3-2dd3-431e-bd97-5a819c30e551&quot; /&gt;

We built multi-theme support in the application. This feature is not included in GPUI Component itself, but is based on the `Theme` feature, so it&#039;s easy to implement.

## Usage

GPUI and GPUI Component are still in development, so you need to add dependencies by git.

```toml
gpui = &quot;0.2.2&quot;
gpui-component = &quot;0.4.0-preview1&quot;
```

### Basic Example

```rs
use gpui::*;
use gpui_component::{button::*, *};

pub struct HelloWorld;
impl Render for HelloWorld {
    fn render(&amp;mut self, _: &amp;mut Window, _: &amp;mut Context&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; impl IntoElement {
        div()
            .v_flex()
            .gap_2()
            .size_full()
            .items_center()
            .justify_center()
            .child(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
            .child(
                Button::new(&quot;ok&quot;)
                    .primary()
                    .label(&quot;Let&#039;s Go!&quot;)
                    .on_click(|_, _, _| println!(&quot;Clicked!&quot;)),
            )
    }
}

fn main() {
    let app = Application::new();

    app.run(move |cx| {
        // This must be called before using any GPUI Component features.
        gpui_component::init(cx);

        cx.spawn(async move |cx| {
            cx.open_window(WindowOptions::default(), |window, cx| {
                let view = cx.new(|_| HelloWorld);
                // This first level on the window, should be a Root.
                cx.new(|cx| Root::new(view.into(), window, cx))
            })?;

            Ok::&lt;_, anyhow::Error&gt;(())
        })
        .detach();
    });
}
```

### WebView

&gt; Still early and experimental; there are a lot of limitations.

GPUI Component has a `WebView` element based on [Wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry). This is an optional feature, which you can enable with a feature flag.

```toml
gpui-component = { version = &quot;0.4.0-preview1&quot;, features = [&quot;webview&quot;] }
wry = { version = &quot;0.53.3, package = &quot;lb-wry&quot; }
```

More usage examples can be found in the [story](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/tree/main/crates/story) directory.

### Icons

GPUI Component has an `Icon` element, but it does not include SVG files by default.

The example uses [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons, but you can use any icons you like. Just name the SVG files as defined in [IconName](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/ui/src/icon.rs#L86). You can add any icons you need to your project.

## Development

We have a gallery of applications built with GPUI Component.

```bash
cargo run
```

More examples can be found in the `examples` directory. You can run them with `cargo run --example &lt;example_name&gt;`.

&gt; An open source Spotify client running as a UNIX daemon.

[Project Website](https://spotifyd.rs)

Spotifyd streams music just like the official client, but is more lightweight and supports more platforms. Spotifyd also supports the Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it show up as a device that can be controlled from the official clients.

&gt; __Note:__ Spotifyd requires a Spotify Premium account.

__To read about how to install and configure Spotifyd, take a look at our [wiki][wiki]!__

## Contributing

We always appreciate help during the development of `spotifyd`! If you are new to programming, open source or Rust in general, take a look at issues tagged with [`good first issue`][good-first-issues]. These normally are easy to resolve and don&#039;t take much time to implement.

## Credits

This project would not have been possible without the amazing reverse engineering work done in [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), mostly by [plietar](https://github.com/plietar).

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

High-performance indexer for YGG Torrent written in Rust

**Key Features**:
- Automatic resolution of the current YGG Torrent domain
- Automated Cloudflare bypass (no manual challenge solving)
- Near-instant search
- Seamless reconnection to expired sessions
- Session caching
- Bypassing lying DNS
- Low memory usage (14.7MB in Linux release mode)
- Modular torrent search (by name, seeders, leechers, comments, release date, etc.)
- Detailed torrent metadata retrieval (description, size, seeders, leechers, etc.)
- Zero external dependencies
- No browser drivers required

## Compilation Requirements
- Rust 1.85.0+
- OpenSSL 3+
- All dependencies required for building [wreq](https://crates.io/crates/wreq)

# Installation

A ready-to-use Docker image is available for Ygégé.
To get started with Docker deployment and configuration, see the [dedicated Docker guide](docs/docker-guide.md).

## Docker

To create a custom Docker image with your own optimizations, refer to the [Docker build guide](docs/docker-dev.md).

## Manual Installation

To compile the application from sources, follow the [manual installation guide](docs/source-guide.md).

## Prowlarr integration

Ygégé can be used as a custom indexer for Prowlarr. To set it up, find your AppData directory (located in the `/system/status` page of Prowlarr) and copy the `ygege.yml` file on the repo in the `{your prowlarr appdata path}/Definitions/Custom` folder, you&#039;ll probably need to create the `Custom` folder.

Once it&#039;s done, restart Prowlarr and go to the indexer settings, you should see Ygégé in the list of available indexers.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Prowlarr doesn&#039;t allow custom &quot;Base URL&quot;. By default the URL is `http://localhost:8715/`. For Docker Compose setups, use `http://ygege:8715/`. Alternatively, use ygege-dns-redirect.local with custom DNS or hosts file redirection.


## Cloudflare Bypass
Ygégé bypasses Cloudflare challenges without browsers or third-party services.

YGG Torrent enforces a Cloudflare rule using the `account_created=true` cookie to prevent challenges, theoretically validating user accounts so we can just inject this cookie. However, Cloudflare still detects fake HTTPS clients and browser spoofing.

Ygégé uses the [wreq](https://crates.io/crates/wreq) library - an HTTP client based on `reqwest` and `tokio` that replicates 1:1 TLS and HTTP/2 exchanges to mimic legitimate browser behavior.

**Note**: Compatibility broke with Chrome 133 likely due to HTTP/3 integration, which `wreq` doesn&#039;t yet simulate.

- [TLS fingerprinting explained](https://fingerprint.com/blog/what-is-tls-fingerprinting-transport-layer-security/)
- [HTTP/2 fingerprinting and bypass techniques](https://www.trickster.dev/post/understanding-http2-fingerprinting/)

## Performance test

Query for search:
- Name: `Vaiana 2`
- Sort: `seeders`
- Order: `descending`

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is the open-source reactive database designed to
make life easy for web app developers, whether human or LLM. Fetch data and
perform business logic with strong consistency by writing pure TypeScript.

Convex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client
libraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.
[Read the docs to learn more](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/).

Development of the Convex backend is led by the Convex team. We
[welcome bug fixes](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[love receiving feedback](https://discord.gg/convex). We keep this repository
synced with any internal development work within a handful of days.

## Getting Started

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/) to learn more about Convex
and follow our getting started guides.

The easiest way to build with Convex is through our
[cloud platform](https://www.convex.dev/plans), which includes a generous free
tier and lets you focus on building your application without worrying about
infrastructure. Many small applications and side-projects can operate entirely
on the free tier with zero cost and zero maintenance.

## Self Hosting

The self-hosted product includes most features of the cloud product, including
the dashboard and CLI. Self-hosted Convex works well with a variety of tools
including Neon, Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, RDS, Sqlite, Postgres, and more.

You can either use Docker (recommended) or a prebuilt binary to self host
Convex. Check out our [self-hosting guide](./self-hosted/README.md) for detailed
instructions. Community support for self-hosting is available in the
`#self-hosted` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/convex).

## Community &amp; Support

- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/convex) for help and
  discussions.
- Report issues when building and using the open source Convex backend through
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/issues)

## Building from source

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).

## Disclaimers

- If you choose to self-host, we recommend following the self-hosting guide. If
  you are instead building from source, make sure to change your instance secret
  and admin key from the defaults in the repo.
- Convex is battle tested most thoroughly on Linux and Mac. On Windows, it has
  less experience. If you run into issues, please message us on
  [Discord](https://convex.dev/community) in the `#self-hosted` channel.
- Convex self-hosted builds contain a beacon to help Convex improve the product.
  The information is minimal and anonymous and helpful to Convex, but if you
  really want to disable it, you can set the `--disable-beacon` flag on the
  backend binary. The beacon&#039;s messages print in the log and only include
  - A random identifier for your deployment (not used elsewhere)
  - Migration version of your database
  - Git rev of the backend
  - Uptime of the backend

## Repository layout

- `crates/` contains Rust code

  - Main binary
    - `local_backend/` is an application server on top of the `Runtime`. This is
      the serving edge for the Convex cloud.

- `npm-packages/` contains both our public and internal TypeScript packages.
  - Internal packages
    - `udf-runtime/` sets up the user-defined functions JS environment for
      queries and mutations
    - `udf-tests/` is a collection of functions used in testing the isolate
      layer
    - `system-udfs/` contains functions used by the Convex system e.g. the CLI
