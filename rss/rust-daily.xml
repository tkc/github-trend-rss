## Description

Paru is your standard pacman wrapping AUR helper with lots of features and minimal interaction.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/sEh1ZpZZUgXUsgqKxuDdhpdEE.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/sEh1ZpZZUgXUsgqKxuDdhpdEE)

## Installation

```
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
cd paru
makepkg -si
```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## General Tips

- **Man pages**: For documentation on paru&#039;s options and config file see `paru(8)` and `paru.conf(5)` respectively.

- **Color**: Paru only enables color if color is enabled in pacman. Enable `color` in your `pacman.conf`.

- **File based review**: To get a more advanced review process enable `FileManager` with your file manager of choice in `paru.conf`.

- **Flip search order**: To get search results to start at the bottom and go upwards, enable `BottomUp` in `paru.conf`.

- **Editing PKGBUILDs**: When editing PKGBUILDs, you can commit your changes to make them permanent. When the package is upgraded, `git` will try to merge your changes with upstream&#039;s.

- **PKGBUILD syntax highlighting**: You can install [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to enable syntax highlighting during PKGBUILD review.

- **Tracking -git packages**: Paru tracks -git package by monitoring the upstream repository. Paru can only do this for packages that paru itself installed. `paru --gendb` will make paru aware of packages it did not install.

## Examples

`paru &lt;target&gt;` -- Interactively search and install `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru` -- Alias for `paru -Syu`.

`paru -S &lt;target&gt;` -- Install a specific package.

`paru -Sua` -- Upgrade AUR packages.

`paru -Qua` -- Print available AUR updates.

`paru -G &lt;target&gt;` -- Download the PKGBUILD and related files of `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru -Gp &lt;target&gt;` -- Print the PKGBUILD of `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru -Gc &lt;target&gt;` -- Print the AUR comments  of `&lt;target&gt;`.

`paru --gendb` -- Generate the devel database for tracking `*-git` packages. This is only needed when you initially start using paru.

`paru -Bi .` -- Build and install a PKGBUILD in the current directory.

## IRC

Paru now has an IRC. #paru on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/). Feel free to join for discussion and help with paru.

## Debugging

Paru is not an official tool. If paru can&#039;t build a package, you should first check if makepkg can successfully build the package. If it can&#039;t, then you should report the issue to the maintainer. Otherwise, it is likely an issue with paru and should be reported here.

![Screenshot of the app, showing a front/back flashcard.](screenshot.webp)

A plain text-based spaced repetition system. Features:

- **Plain Text:** all your flashcards are stored as plain text files, so you can
  operate on them with standard tools, write with your editor of choice, and
  track changes in a VCS.
- **Content Addressable:** cards are identified by the hash of their text. This
  means a card&#039;s progress is reset when the card is edited.
- **Low Friction:** you create flashcards by typing into a text file, using a
  lightweight notation to denote flashcard sides and cloze deletions.
- **Simple:** the only card types are front-back and cloze cards. More complex
  workflows (e.g.: Anki-style note types, card templates, automation) be can
  implemented using a Makefile and some scripts.
- **Efficient:** uses [FSRS] for scheduling reviews, maximizing learning while
  minimizing time spent reviewing.

Announcement blog post: [Hashcards: A Plain-Text Spaced Repetition System][blog].

## Example

The following Markdown file is a valid hashcards deck:

```
Q: How many neurons are there in the human brain?
A: ~80 billion.

C: An [agonist] is a ligand that binds to a receptor and [activates it].

Q: How many synapses are there in a human brain?
A: ~100 trillion

C: In the nervous system, [chemical] communication happens [between] neurons.
```

For a larger example, see [my personal flashcards repo][fc].

## Building

You need [cargo] installed. You can get it through [rustup]. Then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards.git
$ cd hashcards
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To drill flashcards in a directory, run:

```
$ hashcards drill $DIRNAME
```

## Tutorial

Create a directory for your flashcards, and add a Markdown file with some cards:

```bash
$ mkdir cards
$ cd cards
$ cat &gt; Geography.md &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
Q: What is Coulomb&#039;s constant?
A: The proportionality constant of the electric force.

Q: What is an object with zero net charge called?
A: Neutral.
EOF
```

A Markdown file is called a &quot;deck&quot;, and the name of the file, sans extension, is
the name of the deck. This will be shown on top of the flashcard during reviews,
this saves you from having to specify the context in each of the flashcards.

Start drilling:

```bash
$ hashcards drill
```

This opens a web interface at `http://localhost:8000` where you can review your
cards. The interface is simple: you read the question, mentally recall the
answer, and click reveal (or press space). Then you grade yourself on how you
did, with one of four choices:

1. Forgot (shortcut: `1`)
2. Hard (shortcut: `2`)
3. Good (shortcut: `3`)
4. Easy (shortcut: `4`)

Be honest. If you got the answer almost right, press &quot;Forgot&quot;. If you mis-grade
something, you can undo (shortcut: `u`). The session ends when every card has
been graded &quot;Good&quot; or higher. You can end the session prematurely by clicking
&quot;End&quot;, this will save your changes.

To learn how to write good flashcards, read [Effective Spaced Repetition][esr].

## Commands

This section documents the hashcards command line interface.

### `drill`

Start a drilling session.

```bash
$ hashcards drill [DIRECTORY]
```

Note: your progress is not saved until the session ends, either when you run out
of cards, or when you click &quot;End&quot;.

Options:

- `--card-limit=&lt;N&gt;`: Limit the session to at most N cards.
- `--new-card-limit=&lt;N&gt;`: Limit the number of new cards in the session.
- `--port=&lt;PORT&gt;`: Use a specific port (default: 8000).
- `--from-deck=&lt;NAME&gt;`: Only drill cards from a deck with the given name.
- `--open-browser=&lt;true|false&gt;`: Whether or not to open the browser after the
  server starts (default: true).

### `stats`

Print collection statistics to standard output.

```bash
$ hashcards stats [DIRECTORY]
```

Options:

- `--format=&lt;FORMAT&gt;`: Output format (`html` or `json`)

At present, only JSON output is supported.

### `check`

Check the integrity of a collection.

```bash
$ hashcards check [DIRECTORY]
```

### `orphans`

Manage orphan cards (cards that exist in the database, but not in the
collection, i.e., cards that were deleted from the collection).

```bash
$ hashcards orphans list [DIRECTORY]
$ hashcards orphans delete [DIRECTORY]
```

Example:

```
$ hashcards orphans list Cards
04effc035b71692b66a90a622559479516526e7720c41afa22b29562915d58af
059e4e0fd5c3d0ab7ef0cc902cdc402a555ec4152b842fe584109de6c8082ce3
061b8c27e0f437d0c6ae735e829b39cc3bf0ad8218cb16387dcb4271c20b244d
$ hashcards orphans delete Cards
04effc035b71692b66a90a622559479516526e7720c41afa22b29562915d58af
059e4e0fd5c3d0ab7ef0cc902cdc402a555ec4152b842fe584109de6c8082ce3
061b8c27e0f437d0c6ae735e829b39cc3bf0ad8218cb16387dcb4271c20b244d
$ hashcards orphans list Cards
# no output
```

### `export`

Export a collection to a JSON file.

```bash
$ hashcards export [DIRECTORY]
```

Options:

- `--output=&lt;PATH&gt;`: The path to the output. By default, the export is printed
  to stdout.

## Format

This section describes the text format used by hashcards.

### Basic Cards

Question-answer flashcards are written like this:

```
Q: What are the possible values of electric charge?
A: Any integer multiple of the fundamental charge.
```

Both the question and the answer can span multiple lines:

```
Q: List the elements of the Platinum group.
A:

- ruthenium
- rhodium
- palladium
- osmium
- iridium
- platinum
```

### Cloze Cards

Cloze cards start with the `C:` tag, and use square brackets to denote cloze
deletions:

```
C: The [order] of a group is [the cardinality of its underlying set].
```

Again, cloze cards can span multiple lines:

```
C:
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

— [Ecclesiastes] [6]:[9]
```

## Features

This section documents specific hashcards features.

### LaTeX Support

Cards support LaTeX math via KaTeX.

Use `$...$` for inline math:

```
Q: What is the combinatorial meaning of $\binom{n}{k}$?
A: From a set of size $n$, we can choose $\binom{n}{k}$ subsets of size $k$.
```

And `$$...$$` for display math:

```
C: The [amount of substance] of a sample, denoted $n$, is defined as:

$$
n = \frac{N}{N_A}
$$

where $N$ is [the number of elementary entities] and $N_A$ is [Avogadro&#039;s constant].
```

You can define custom LaTeX macros by creating a `macros.tex` file in your
collection root:

```
\C \mathbb{C}
\R \mathbb{R}
```

Macro definitions can refer to arguments: `#1` for the first, `#2` for the
second and so on.

### Images

Ordinary Markdown image syntax works:

```
Q: Identify this painting:

![](art/diagram.png)

A: _The Siren_, by John William Waterhouse.
```

By default, image paths are resolved relative to the deck (the Markdown file)
that contains the flashcard. For example, if you have:

```
cards/
  Art Theory/
    Art.md
    Images/
      TheMermaid.jpg
      Circe.jpg
      Odysseus.jpg
```

Then flashcards in `Art.md` can reference images with paths like
`Images/Circe.jpg`.

By prefixing a path with `@/`, you can point to images relative to the
collection root directory, e.g., a path like `@/Art Theory/Images/Circe.jpg`
will always resolve to the same path, even if the deck is moved around within
the collection.

### Audio

Works like images:

```
Q: How do you pronounce &quot;پرنده&quot; in Persian?
A: ![](audio/parande.mp3)
```

### Deck Names

By default, the filename of a deck is the name of a deck, e.g. a file
`Medicine.md` will be parsed as a deck called `Medicine`. It is possible to
override the name using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) frontmatter, like so:

```
---
name = &quot;Medicine&quot;
---

C: The mitochondria is the [powerhouse] of the cell.
```

Regardless of the filename, cards in this deck will have `Medicine` as their
deck name. This is particularly useful when you want to organize a large number
of cards into different files, while keeping their deck name the same. For
example, when taking notes from a textbook, you might have something like so:

```
Principles of Neural Science/
  Ch1.md
  Ch2.md
  ...
```

But you don&#039;t want the cards in those Markdown files to have `Ch1`, `Ch2`, etc.
as their deck name. TOML frontmatter allows you to give each chapter deck the same
deck name.

## Database

hashcards stores card performance data and the review history in an SQLite3
database. The file is called `hashcards.db` and is found in the root of the card
directory (i.e., the path you pass to the `drill` command).

The `cards` table has the following schema:

| Column             | Type               | Description                                                                                                                         |

| `review_count`     | `integer not null` | The number of times the card has been reviewed.                                                                                     |

The `sessions` table has the following schema:

| Column       | Type                  | Description                                                  |

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codex CLI&lt;/strong&gt; is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;If you want Codex in your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide&quot;&gt;install in your IDE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;If you are looking for the &lt;em&gt;cloud-based agent&lt;/em&gt; from OpenAI, &lt;strong&gt;Codex Web&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/codex&quot;&gt;chatgpt.com/codex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

If you&#039;re running into upgrade issues with Homebrew, see the [FAQ entry on brew upgrade codex](./docs/faq.md#brew-upgrade-codex-isnt-upgrading-me).

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you&#039;re having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex can access MCP servers. To configure them, refer to the [config docs](./docs/config.md#mcp_servers).

### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

### Execpolicy

See the [Execpolicy quickstart](./docs/execpolicy.md) to set up rules that govern what commands Codex can execute.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

## 👉 Live Demo: https://reacher.email

&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/saasify-uploads-prod/696e287ad79f0e0352bc201b36d701849f7d55e7.svg&quot; height=&quot;68&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;

This is open-source, but I also offer a **SaaS** solution that has `check-if-email-exists` packaged in a nice friendly web interface. If you are interested, find out more at [Reacher](https://reacher.email/?ref=github). If you have any questions, you can contact me at amaury@reacher.email.

&lt;br /&gt;

## Get Started

3 non-SaaS ways to get started with `check-if-email-exists`.

### 1. ⚙️ HTTP backend using Docker (popular method 🥇) [[Full docs](./backend/README.md)]

This option allows you to run a HTTP backend using Docker 🐳, on a cloud instance or your own server. Please note that outbound port 25 must be open.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 reacherhq/backend:latest
```

Then send a `POST http://localhost:8080/v0/check_email` request with the following body:

```js
{
    &quot;to_email&quot;: &quot;someone@gmail.com&quot;,
    &quot;proxy&quot;: {                        // (optional) SOCK5 proxy to run the verification through, default is empty
        &quot;host&quot;: &quot;my-proxy.io&quot;,
        &quot;port&quot;: 1080,
        &quot;username&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,             // (optional) Proxy username
        &quot;password&quot;: &quot;pass&quot;            // (optional) Proxy password
    },
}
```

### 2. Download the CLI [[Full docs](./cli/README.md)]

&gt; Note: The CLI binary doesn&#039;t connect to any backend, it checks the email directly from your computer.

Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists/releases) and download the binary for your platform.

```bash
&gt; $ check_if_email_exists --help
check_if_email_exists 0.9.1
Check if an email address exists without sending an email.

USAGE:
    check_if_email_exists [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [TO_EMAIL]
```

Check out the [dedicated README.md](./cli/README.md) for all options and flags.

### 3. Programmatic Usage [[Full docs](https://docs.rs/check-if-email-exists)]

In your own Rust project, you can add `check-if-email-exists` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
check-if-email-exists = &quot;0.9&quot;
```

And use it in your code as follows:

```rust
use check_if_email_exists::{check_email, CheckEmailInput, CheckEmailInputProxy};

async fn check() {
    // Let&#039;s say we want to test the deliverability of someone@gmail.com.
    let mut input = CheckEmailInput::new(vec![&quot;someone@gmail.com&quot;.into()]);

    // Verify this email, using async/await syntax.
    let result = check_email(&amp;input).await;

    // `result` is a `Vec&lt;CheckEmailOutput&gt;`, where the CheckEmailOutput
    // struct contains all information about our email.
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, result);
}
```

The reference docs are hosted on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/check-if-email-exists).

## ✈️ JSON Output

The output will be a JSON with the below format, the fields should be self-explanatory. For `someone@gmail.com` (note that it is disabled by Gmail), here&#039;s the exact output:

```json
{
	&quot;input&quot;: &quot;someone@gmail.com&quot;,
	&quot;is_reachable&quot;: &quot;invalid&quot;,
	&quot;misc&quot;: {
		&quot;is_disposable&quot;: false,
		&quot;is_role_account&quot;: false,
		&quot;is_b2c&quot;: true
	},
	&quot;mx&quot;: {
		&quot;accepts_mail&quot;: true,
		&quot;records&quot;: [
			&quot;alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.&quot;,
			&quot;gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.&quot;,
			&quot;alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.&quot;,
			&quot;alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.&quot;,
			&quot;alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.&quot;
		]
	},
	&quot;smtp&quot;: {
		&quot;can_connect_smtp&quot;: true,
		&quot;has_full_inbox&quot;: false,
		&quot;is_catch_all&quot;: false,
		&quot;is_deliverable&quot;: false,
		&quot;is_disabled&quot;: true
	},
	&quot;syntax&quot;: {
		&quot;domain&quot;: &quot;gmail.com&quot;,
		&quot;is_valid_syntax&quot;: true,
		&quot;username&quot;: &quot;someone&quot;,
		&quot;suggestion&quot;: null
	}
}
```

&lt;/div&gt;

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

Our key objectives include:
- Matching GNU&#039;s output (stdout and error code) exactly
- Better error messages
- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)
- Improved performances
- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

Use [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

Replace `--release` with `--profile=release-fast` or `--profile=release-small` to use all optimizations or save binary size.

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

To build SELinux-specific features, including `chcon` and `runcon`, ensure that `libselinux` 
and `libclang` are installed on your system. Then, run the following command:
```
cargo build --release --features unix,feat_selinux
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you want to build the utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible:

```shell
cargo build --release --bins --workspace --exclude coreutils --exclude uu_runcon --exclude uu_chcon
```
Each utility is contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build selected individual utilities, use the `--package` [aka `-p`] option. For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities (with debug profile):

```shell
make
```

In release-fast mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release-fast
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install all utilities with all possible optimizations:

```shell
make PROFILE=release-fast install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=uu- install
```

`PROG_PREFIX` requires separator `-`, `_`, or `=`.

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `uudoc` binary generates completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells to stdout.

Install `uudoc` by
```shell
cargo install --bin uudoc --features uudoc --path .
```

Then use the installed binary:
```shell
uudoc completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
uudoc completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls.bash
```

Completion for prefixed `cp` with `uu-` on `zsh` is generated by
```shell
env PROG_PREFIX=uu- uudoc completion cp zsh
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
uudoc manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
uudoc manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=uu- uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

**Iggy** is a persistent message streaming platform written in Rust, supporting QUIC, WebSocket, TCP (custom binary specification) and HTTP (regular REST API) transport protocols, **capable of processing millions of messages per second at ultra-low latency**.

Iggy provides **exceptionally high throughput and performance** while utilizing minimal computing resources.

This is **not yet another extension** running on top of existing infrastructure, such as Kafka or SQL database.

Iggy is a persistent message streaming log **built from the ground up** using low-level I/O with **thread-per-core shared nothing architecture**, `io_uring` and `compio` for maximum speed and efficiency.

The name is an abbreviation for the Italian Greyhound - small yet extremely fast dogs, the best in their class. See the lovely [Fabio &amp; Cookie](https://www.instagram.com/fabio.and.cookie/) ❤️

---

## Features

- **Highly performant**, persistent append-only log for message streaming
- **Very high throughput** for both writes and reads
- **Low latency and predictable resource usage** thanks to the Rust compiled language (no GC) and `io_uring`.
- **User authentication and authorization** with granular permissions and Personal Access Tokens (PAT)
- Support for multiple streams, topics and partitions
- Support for **multiple transport protocols** (QUIC, WebSocket, TCP, HTTP)
- Fully operational RESTful API which can be optionally enabled
- Available client SDK in multiple languages
- **Thread per core shared nothing design** together with `io_uring` guarantee the best possible performance on modern `Linux` systems.
- **Works directly with binary data**, avoiding enforced schema and serialization/deserialization overhead
- Custom **zero-copy (de)serialization**, which greatly improves the performance and reduces memory usage.
- Configurable server features (e.g. caching, segment size, data flush interval, transport protocols etc.)
- Server-side storage of **consumer offsets**
- Multiple ways of polling the messages:
  - By offset (using the indexes)
  - By timestamp (using the time indexes)
  - First/Last N messages
  - Next N messages for the specific consumer
- Possibility of **auto committing the offset** (e.g. to achieve *at-most-once* delivery)
- **Consumer groups** providing the message ordering and horizontal scaling across the connected clients
- **Message expiry** with auto deletion based on the configurable **retention policy**
- Additional features such as **server side message deduplication**
- **Multi-tenant** support via abstraction of **streams** which group **topics**
- **TLS** support for all transport protocols (TCP, WebSocket, QUIC, HTTPS)
- **[Connectors](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/connectors)** - sinks, sources and data transformations based on the **custom Rust plugins**
- **[Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/ai/mcp)** - provide context to LLM with **MCP server**
- Optional server-side as well as client-side **data encryption** using AES-256-GCM
- Optional metadata support in the form of **message headers**
- Optional **data backups and archiving** to disk or **S3** compatible cloud storage (e.g. AWS S3)
- Support for **OpenTelemetry** logs &amp; traces + Prometheus metrics
- Built-in **CLI** to manage the streaming server installable via `cargo install iggy-cli`
- Built-in **benchmarking app** to test the performance
- **Single binary deployment** (no external dependencies)
- Running as a single node (clustering based on Viewstamped Replication will be implemented in the near future)

## Architecture

This is the high-level architecture of the Iggy message streaming server, where extremely high performance and ultra low and stable tail latencies are the primary goals. The server is designed to handle high throughput and very low latency (sub-millisecond tail latencies), making it suitable for real-time applications. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/introduction/architecture).

![server](assets/iggy_architecture.png)

---

## Version

The official releases follow the regular semver (`0.5.0`) or have `latest` tag applied (`apache/iggy:latest`).

We do also publish edge/dev/nightly releases (e.g. `0.6.0-edge.1` or `apache/iggy:edge`), for both, SDKs and the Docker images, which are typically compatible with the latest changes, but are not guaranteed to be stable, and as the name states, are not recommended for production use.

---

## Roadmap

- **Clustering** &amp; data replication based on **[VSR](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf)** (on sandbox project using Raft, will be implemented after shared-nothing design is completed)

---

## Supported languages SDK

- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/iggy)
- [C#](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Iggy/)
- [Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.iggy/iggy)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/apache-iggy/)
- [Node.js (TypeScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-iggy)
- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/iggy/foreign/go)

C++ and Elixir are work in progress.

---

## CLI

The interactive CLI is implemented under the `cli` project, to provide the best developer experience. This is a great addition to the Web UI, especially for all the developers who prefer using the console tools.

Iggy CLI can be installed with `cargo install iggy-cli` and then simply accessed by typing `iggy` in your terminal.

![CLI](assets/cli.png)

## Web UI

There&#039;s a dedicated Web UI for the server, which allows managing the streams, topics, partitions, browsing the messages and so on. This is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive dashboard for administrative purposes of the Iggy server. Check the Web UI in the `/web` directory. The [docker image for Web UI](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iggy-web-ui) is available, and can be fetched via `docker pull apache/iggy-web-ui`.

![Web UI](assets/web_ui.png)

---

## Connectors

The highly performant and modular **[runtime](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/connectors)** for statically typed, yet dynamically loaded connectors. Ingest the data from the external sources and push it further to the Iggy streams, or fetch the data from the Iggy streams and push it further to the external sources. **Create your own Rust plugins** by simply implementing either the `Source` or `Sink` trait and **build custom pipelines for the data processing**.

```toml
## Configure a sink or source connector, depending on your needs in its own config file.
type = &quot;sink&quot;
key = &quot;quickwit&quot;
enabled = true
version = 0
name = &quot;Quickwit sink&quot;
path = &quot;target/release/libiggy_connector_quickwit_sink&quot;
plugin_config_format = &quot;yaml&quot;

[[streams]]
stream = &quot;qw&quot;
topics = [&quot;records&quot;]
schema = &quot;json&quot;
batch_length = 1000
poll_interval = &quot;5ms&quot;
consumer_group = &quot;qw_sink_connector&quot;

[transforms.add_fields]
enabled = true

[[transforms.add_fields.fields]]
key = &quot;service_name&quot;
value.static = &quot;qw_connector&quot;

[[transforms.add_fields.fields]]
key = &quot;timestamp&quot;
value.computed = &quot;timestamp_millis&quot;

[transforms.delete_fields]
enabled = true
fields = [&quot;email&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;]
```

---

## Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. The **[Iggy MCP Server](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/master/core/ai/mcp)** is an implementation of the MCP protocol for the message streaming infrastructure. It can be used to provide context to LLMs in real-time, allowing for more accurate and relevant responses.

![server](assets/iggy_mcp_server.png)

---

## Docker

The official Apache Iggy images can be found in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/iggy), simply type `docker pull apache/iggy` to pull the image.

You can also find the images for all the different tooling such as Connectors, MCP Server etc. at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/apache?page=1&amp;search=iggy).

Please note that the images tagged as `latest` are based on the official, stable releases, while the `edge` ones are updated directly from latest version of the `master` branch.

You can find the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` in the root of the repository. To build and start the server, run: `docker compose up`.

Additionally, you can run the `CLI` which is available in the running container, by executing: `docker exec -it iggy-server /iggy`.

Keep in mind that running the container on the OS other than Linux, where the Docker is running in the VM, might result in the performance degradation.

Also, when running the container, **make sure to include the additional capabilities**, as you can find in [docker-compose](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file:

```yml
cap_add:
  - SYS_NICE
security_opt:
  - seccomp:unconfined
ulimits:
  memlock:
    soft: -1
    hard: -1
```

---

## Configuration

The default configuration can be found in `server.toml` file in `configs` directory.

The configuration file is loaded from the current working directory, but you can specify the path to the configuration file by setting `IGGY_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, for example `export IGGY_CONFIG_PATH=configs/server.toml` (or other command depending on OS).

When config file is not found, the default values from embedded `server.toml` file are used.

For the detailed documentation of the configuration file, please refer to the [configuration](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/configuration) section.

---

## Quick start

Build the project (the longer compilation time is due to [LTO](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html) enabled in release [profile](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L2):

`cargo build`

Run the tests:

`cargo test`

Set root user credentials (OPTIONAL):

Iggy requires credentials to authenticate request to the server.
You can set the root user **before** starting the server.

(macOS/Linux)

```bash
export IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy
export IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy
```

(Windows(Powershell))

```bash
$env:IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME = &quot;iggy&quot;
$env:IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD = &quot;iggy&quot;
```

By default, `iggy-server` will generate a randomized root user password and print it to `stdout`, when there&#039;s
NO users created.

Start the server:

`cargo run --bin iggy-server`

All the data used by the server will be persisted under the `local_data` directory by default, unless specified differently in the configuration (see `system.path` in `server.toml`).

One can use default root credentials with optional `--with-default-root-credentials`.
This flag is equivalent to setting `IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy` and `IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy`, plus
it should only be used for development and testing.

`cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --with-default-root-credentials`

Root credentials are only set on the first server startup when the data directory doesn&#039;t exist yet. Once the server has been started and persisted data exists, the existing root credentials will be reused, and the `--with-default-root-credentials` flag or environment variables will have no effect. To reset credentials, delete the data directory.

For configuration options and detailed help:

`cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --help`

You can also use environment variables to override any configuration setting:

- Override TCP address
   `IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8090 cargo run --bin iggy-server`

- Set custom data path
   `IGGY_SYSTEM_PATH=/data/iggy cargo run --bin iggy-server`

- Enable HTTP transport
   `IGGY_HTTP_ENABLED=true cargo run --bin iggy-server`

- Set custom root user credentials
   `IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy cargo run --bin iggy-server`

To quickly generate the sample data:

`cargo run --bin data-seeder-tool`

*Please note that all commands below are using `iggy` binary, which is part of release (`cli` sub-crate).*

Create a stream with name `dev` (numerical ID will be assigned by server automatically) using default credentials and `tcp` transport (available transports: `quic`, `websocket`, `tcp`, `http`, default `tcp`):

`cargo run --bin iggy -- --transport tcp --username &lt;iggy_username&gt; --password &lt;iggy_password&gt; stream create dev`

List available streams:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- --username &lt;iggy_username&gt; --password &lt;iggy_password&gt; stream list`

Get `dev` stream details:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; stream get dev`

Create a topic named `sample` (numerical ID will be assigned by server automatically) for stream `dev`, with 2 partitions (IDs 1 and 2), disabled compression (`none`) and disabled message expiry (skipped optional parameter):

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; topic create dev sample 2 none`

List available topics for stream `dev`:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; topic list dev`

Get topic details for topic `sample` in stream `dev`:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; topic get dev sample`

Send a message &#039;hello world&#039; (message ID 1) to the stream `dev` to topic `sample` and partition 1:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; message send --partition-id 1 dev sample &quot;hello world&quot;`

Send another message &#039;lorem ipsum&#039; (message ID 2) to the same stream, topic and partition:

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; message send --partition-id 1 dev sample &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;`

Poll messages by a regular consumer with ID 1 from the stream `dev` for topic `sample` and partition with ID 1, starting with offset 0, messages count 2, without auto commit (storing consumer offset on server):

`cargo run --bin iggy -- -u &lt;iggy_username&gt; -p &lt;iggy_password&gt; message poll --consumer 1 --offset 0 --message-count 2 --auto-commit dev sample 1`

Finally, restart the server to see it is able to load the persisted data.

The HTTP API endpoints can be found in [server.http](https://github.com/apache/iggy/blob/master/core/server/server.http) file, which can be used with [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension for VS Code.

To see the detailed logs from the CLI/server, run it with `RUST_LOG=trace` environment variable. See images below:

## Examples

You can find comprehensive sample applications under the `examples/rust` directory. These examples showcase various usage patterns of the Iggy client SDK, from basic operations to advanced multi-tenant scenarios.

For detailed information about available examples and how to run them, please see the [Examples README](examples/rust/README.md).

---

## SDK

Iggy comes with the Rust SDK, which is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/iggy).

The SDK provides both, low-level client for the specific transport, which includes the message sending and polling along with all the administrative actions such as managing the streams, topics, users etc., as well as the high-level client, which abstracts the low-level details and provides the easy-to-use API for both, message producers and consumers.

You can find the more examples, including the multi-tenant one under the `examples` directory.

```rust
// Create the Iggy client
let client = IggyClient::from_connection_string(&quot;iggy://user:secret@localhost:8090&quot;)?;

// Create a producer for the given stream and one of its topics
let mut producer = client
    .producer(&quot;dev01&quot;, &quot;events&quot;)?
    .direct( // Use either direct (instant) or background message sending
        DirectConfig::builder()
            .batch_length(1000)
            .linger_time(IggyDuration::from_str(&quot;1ms&quot;)?)
            .build(),
    )
    .partitioning(Partitioning::balanced())
    .build();

producer.init().await?;

// Send some messages to the topic
let messages = vec![IggyMessage::from_str(&quot;Hello Apache Iggy&quot;)?];
producer.send(messages).await?;

// Create a consumer for the given stream and one of its topics
let mut consumer = client
    .consumer_group(&quot;my_app&quot;, &quot;dev01&quot;, &quot;events&quot;)?
    .auto_commit(AutoCommit::IntervalOrWhen(
        IggyDuration::from_str(&quot;1s&quot;)?,
        AutoCommitWhen::ConsumingAllMessages,
    ))
    .create_consumer_group_if_not_exists()
    .auto_join_consumer_group()
    .polling_strategy(PollingStrategy::next())
    .poll_interval(IggyDuration::from_str(&quot;1ms&quot;)?)
    .batch_length(1000)
    .build();

consumer.init().await?;

// Start consuming the messages
while let Some(message) = consumer.next().await {
    // Handle the message
}
```

## Benchmarks

**Benchmarks should be the first-class citizens**. We believe that performance is crucial for any system, and we strive to provide the best possible performance for our users. Please check, why we believe that the **[transparent
benchmarking](https://iggy.apache.org/blogs/2025/02/17/transparent-benchmarks)** is so important.

We&#039;ve also built the **[benchmarking platform](https://benchmarks.iggy.apache.org)** where anyone can upload the benchmarks and compare the results with others. Source code for the platform is available in the `core/bench/dashboard` directory.

![server](assets/benchmarking_platform.png)

For the benchmarking purposes, we&#039;ve developed the dedicated **iggy-bench** tool, which is a part of the **iggy** project. It is a command-line tool that allows you to run the variety of fully customizable benchmarks.

![server](assets/bench.png)

To benchmark the project, first build the project in release mode:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then, run the benchmarking app with the desired options:

1. Sending (writing) benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v pinned-producer tcp
   ```

2. Polling (reading) benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v pinned-consumer tcp
   ```

3. Parallel sending and polling benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v pinned-producer-and-consumer tcp
   ```

4. Balanced sending to multiple partitions benchmark

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v balanced-producer tcp
   ```

5. Consumer group polling benchmark:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v balanced-consumer-group tcp
   ```

6. Parallel balanced sending and polling from consumer group benchmark:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v balanced-producer-and-consumer-group tcp
   ```

7. End to end producing and consuming benchmark (single task produces and consumes messages in sequence):

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin iggy-bench -r -- -v end-to-end-producing-consumer tcp
   ```

These benchmarks would start the server with the default configuration, create a stream, topic and partition, and then send or poll the messages. The default configuration is o

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

See the [installation documentation](docs/install).

## Documentation

See the [official documentation](docs) including:

- [Installation guides](docs/install)
- [Developer guide](docs/Developer-Guide.md)
- [Design documents](docs/design)
  - [Architecture overview](docs/design/architecture)
  - [Architecture 3.0 overview](docs/design/architecture_3.0/)

## Configuration

Kata Containers uses a single
[configuration file](src/runtime/README.md#configuration)
which contains a number of sections for various parts of the Kata
Containers system including the [runtime](src/runtime), the
[agent](src/agent) and the [hypervisor](#hypervisors).

## Hypervisors

See the [hypervisors document](docs/hypervisors.md) and the
[Hypervisor specific configuration details](src/runtime/README.md#hypervisor-specific-configuration).

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **⚠️ Warning:** This software is in BETA. It may still contain bugs and unexpected behavior. Use caution with production data and ensure you have backups.

## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Multi-language support** for
  * [Go](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Encryption at rest** for protecting the data locally.
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view maintenance and query subscriptions.

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦫 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
go install github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;☕️ Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🤖 MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

### Configuration

Add Turso to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/path/to/your/database.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides nine tools for database interaction:

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant:

- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;

### MCP Clients

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Code&lt;/summary&gt;

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

#### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

#### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ↑            ↑       ↑                           ↑
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

#### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

#### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Desktop&lt;/summary&gt;

For Claude Desktop, add the configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;turso&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;/path/to/.turso/tursodb&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cursor&lt;/summary&gt;

For Cursor, configure MCP in your settings:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to Extensions → MCP
3. Add a new server with:
   - **Name**: `turso`
   - **Command**: `/path/to/.turso/tursodb`
   - **Args**: `[&quot;./path/to/your/database.db.db&quot;, &quot;--mcp&quot;]`

Alternatively, you can add it to your Cursor configuration file directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Direct JSON-RPC Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it directly:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Contributing

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](simulator/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

List of rewarded cases:

* B-Tree interior cell replacement issue in btrees with depth &gt;=3 ([#2106](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2106))
* Don&#039;t allow autovacuum to be flipped on non-empty databases ([#3830](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/pull/3830))

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

Turso core staff are not eligible.

## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12 3.13 3.14
Installed 3 versions in 972ms
 + cpython-3.12.12-macos-aarch64-none (python3.12)
 + cpython-3.13.9-macos-aarch64-none (python3.13)
 + cpython-3.14.0-macos-aarch64-none (python3.14)

```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

`wgpu` is a cross-platform, safe, pure-Rust graphics API. It runs natively on Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL; and on top of WebGL2 and WebGPU on wasm.

The API is based on the [WebGPU standard][webgpu], but is a fully native Rust library. It serves as the core of the WebGPU integration in Firefox, Servo, and Deno.

## Getting Started

See our examples online at &lt;https://wgpu.rs/examples/&gt;. You can see the Rust sources at [examples](examples) and run them directly with `cargo run --bin wgpu-examples &lt;example&gt;`.

### Learning `wgpu`

If you are new to `wgpu` and graphics programming, we recommend starting with [Learn Wgpu].
&lt;!-- Note, &quot;Learn Wgpu&quot; is using the capitalization style in their header, NOT our styling --&gt;

Additionally, [WebGPU Fundamentals] is a tutorial for WebGPU which is very similar to our API, minus differences between Rust and Javascript.

### Other Languages

To use wgpu in C or dozens of other languages, look at [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native). These are C bindings to wgpu and has an up-to-date list of libraries bringing support to other languages. 

[Learn WebGPU (for C++)] is a good resource for learning how to use wgpu-native from C++.

## Environment Variables

Testing, examples, and `::from_env()` methods use a standardized set of environment variables to control wgpu&#039;s behavior.

- `WGPU_BACKEND` with a comma-separated list of the backends you want to use (`vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12`, or `gl`).
- `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` with a case-insensitive substring of the name of the adapter you want to use (ex. `1080` will match `NVIDIA GeForce 1080ti`).
- `WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` with the DX12 shader compiler you wish to use (`dxc`, `static-dxc`, or `fxc`). Note that `dxc` requires `dxcompiler.dll` (min v1.8.2502) to be in the working directory, and `static-dxc` requires the `static-dxc` crate feature to be enabled. Otherwise, it will fall back to `fxc`.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/index.html?search=env) for more environment variables.

When running the CTS, use the variables `DENO_WEBGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`, `DENO_WEBGPU_BACKEND`, `DENO_WEBGPU_POWER_PREFERENCE`.

## Repo Overview

For an overview of all the components in the gfx-rs ecosystem, see [the big picture](./docs/big-picture.png).

## MSRV policy

TL;DR: If you&#039;re using `wgpu`, our MSRV is **1.88**.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt; Specific Details &lt;/summary&gt;

Due to complex dependants, we have two MSRV policies:

- `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types`&#039;s MSRV is **1.82**.
- The rest of the workspace has an MSRV of **1.88**.

It is enforced on CI (in &quot;/.github/workflows/ci.yml&quot;) with the `CORE_MSRV` and `REPO_MSRV` variables.
This version can only be upgraded in breaking releases, though we release a breaking version every three months.

The `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types` crates should never
require an MSRV ahead of Firefox&#039;s MSRV for nightly builds, as
determined by the value of `MINIMUM_RUST_VERSION` in
[`python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py`][util].

[util]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py

&lt;/details&gt;

## Testing and Environment Variables

## Tracking the WebGPU and WGSL draft specifications

The `wgpu` crate is meant to be an idiomatic Rust translation of the [WebGPU API][webgpu spec].
That specification, along with its shading language, [WGSL][wgsl spec],
are both still in the &quot;Working Draft&quot; phase,
and while the general outlines are stable,
details change frequently.
Until the specification is stabilized, the `wgpu` crate and the version of WGSL it implements
will likely differ from what is specified,
as the implementation catches up.

Exactly which WGSL features `wgpu` supports depends on how you are using it:

- When running as native code, `wgpu` uses [Naga][naga]
  to translate WGSL code into the shading language of your platform&#039;s native GPU API.
  Naga is working on catching up to the WGSL specification,
  with [bugs][naga bugs] tracking various issues,
  but there is no concise summary of differences from the specification.

- When running in a web browser (by compilation to WebAssembly)
  without the `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` relies on the browser&#039;s own WebGPU implementation.
  WGSL shaders are simply passed through to the browser,
  so that determines which WGSL features you can use.

- When running in a web browser with `wgpu`&#039;s `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` uses Naga to translate WGSL programs into GLSL.
  This uses the same version of Naga as if you were running `wgpu` as native code.

# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet

Welcome to the [Rust][rust] implementation of [Apache Arrow], the popular in-memory columnar format.

This repository contains the following crates:

| Crate              | Description                                                                  | Latest API Docs                                  | README                            |

| [`parquet_derive`] | A crate for deriving RecordWriter/RecordReader for arbitrary, simple structs | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/parquet-derive/latest) | [(README)][parquet-derive-readme] |

The current development version the API documentation in this repo can be found [here](https://arrow.apache.org/rust).

Note: previously the [`object_store`] crate was also part of this repository,
but it has been moved to the [arrow-rs-object-store repository]

## Release Versioning and Schedule

The Arrow Rust project releases approximately monthly and follows [Semantic
Versioning].

Due to available maintainer and testing bandwidth, [`arrow`] crates ([`arrow`],
[`arrow-flight`], etc.) are released on the same schedule with the same versions
as the [`parquet`] and [`parquet-derive`] crates.

This crate releases every month. We release new major versions (with potentially
breaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor
versions in the intervening months. See [ticket #5368] for more details.

To keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major
and minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes
is described in the [contributing] guide.

### Rust Version Compatibility Policy

arrow-rs and parquet are built and tested with stable Rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) that can only be updated in major releases on a need by basis (e.g. project dependencies bump their MSRV or a particular Rust feature is useful for us etc.). The new MSRV if selected will be at least 6 months old. The minor releases are guaranteed to have the same MSRV.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

### Guidelines for `panic` vs `Result`

In general, use panics for bad states that are unreachable, unrecoverable or harmful.
For those caused by invalid user input, however, we prefer to report that invalidity
gracefully as an error result instead of panicking. In general, invalid input should result
in an `Error` as soon as possible. It _is_ ok for code paths after validation to assume
validation has already occurred and panic if not. See [ticket #6737] for more nuances.

[ticket #6737]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6737

### Deprecation Guidelines

Minor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows
downstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This
gives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.

To deprecate an API:

- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated
- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition

The deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please
consult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the
`#[deprecated(since = &quot;...&quot;, note = &quot;...&quot;)]` attribute.

For example

```rust
#[deprecated(since = &quot;51.0.0&quot;, note = &quot;Use `date_part` instead&quot;)]
```

In general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after
they were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API
deprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs
may be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the
maintainers.

[object_store-readme]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store/blob/main/README.md

Collectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.

For example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the
[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),
evaluate it in-memory using Arrow&#039;s columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),
and send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).

Generally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow
arrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,
including `join`s and window functions.

You can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.

## Arrow Rust Community

The `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.

The Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is
a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:

1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list
2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]
3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)

The Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and
this plays a critical role in the release process.

For design discussions we generally use GitHub issues.

## Project Structure &amp; Releases

This repository contains all components that make up TrailBase including the
server, client libraries, tests, documentation and examples.
Only the [benchmarks](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark) are
kept separately due to their external dependencies.

Pre-built binaries are available as
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/releases/) for
Linux, MacOS and Windows or [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/trailbase/trailbase).

Client packages for various languages are available via:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trailbase)
- [Dart/Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/trailbase)
- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/trailbase-client)
- [C#/.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TrailBase/)
- [Swift](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/tree/main/client/swift/trailbase)
- [Kotlin](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.trailbase/trailbase-client)
- [Go](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/tree/main/client/go/trailbase)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/trailbase/)

## Getting Started

TrailBase is a **single executable** and therefore very easy to
[deploy](https://trailbase.io/getting-started/install/).
You can simply download the appropriate pre-built
[GitHub release](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/releases/) bundle for
your system (MacOS, Linux or Windows), unpack and run the executable w/o having
to worry about dependencies or shared-library skew.

If you want to get started even quicker, install TrailBase with the following
command:

```sh
# Linux &amp; MacOS
curl -sSL https://trailbase.io/install.sh | bash

# Windows
iwr https://trailbase.io/install.ps1 | iex
```

Alternatively, run TrailBase using the Docker image:

```sh
alias trail=&#039;
  mkdir -p traildepot &amp;&amp; \
  docker run \
      -p 4000:4000 \
      -e ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:4000 \
      --mount type=bind,source=&quot;$PWD&quot;/traildepot,target=/app/traildepot \
      trailbase/trailbase /app/trail&#039;
```

Then execute `trail help` to check that it is properly installed and list all
available command line options.

To bring up the server on `localhost:4000`, run:

```sh
trail run
```

On first start, a `./traildepot` folder will be bootstrapped, an admin user
created and their credentials printed to the terminal.
Afterwards open [http://localhost:4000/\_/admin/](http://localhost:4000/_/admin/)
in your browser and use the credentials to log into the admin dashboard.

If you want to install the auth UI, you can simply run:

```sh
trail components add trailbase/auth_ui
```

, which will add a WASM component in `./traildepot/wasm` exposing additional UI
endpoints, e.g.
[http://localhost:4000/\_/auth/login](http://localhost:4000/_/auth/login).

## Building

If you have all the necessary build dependencies (Rust, protobuf, node.js,
pnpm) installed, you can build TrailBase by running:

```sh
# Windows only: make sure to enable symlinks (w/o `mklink` permissions for your
# user, git will fall back to copies).
git config core.symlinks true &amp;&amp; git reset --hard

# Download necessary git sub-modules.
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install Javascript dependencies first. Required for the next step.
pnpm install

# Build the executable. Adding `--release` will yield a more optimized binary
# but slow builds significantly.
cargo build --bin trail
```

Alternatively, if you want to build a Docker image or don&#039;t want to deal with
build dependencies, you can simply run:

```sh
# Download necessary git sub-modules.
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the container as defined in `Dockerfile`.
docker build . -t trailbase
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very much appreciated 🙏. For anything beyond bug fixes,
let&#039;s briefly chat to see how a proposal fits into the overall roadmap and
avoid any surprises.

We&#039;re not sure yet what the best setup or exact license is for compatibility
between OSL-3.0 and more popular licenses or use as a framework.
So we&#039;d ask you to sign a simple CLA that retains your copyright, ensures that
TrailBase will continue to forever be freely available under an OSI-approved
copyleft license, while allowing for some flexibility and sub-licensing as
established by much larger, successful projects such as Grafana or Element.

## License

TrailBase is free software under the terms of the [Open Software License 3.0
(OSL-3.0)](https://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0).

We chose the OSL-3.0 over other, better known copyleft licenses due to its
narrower definition of &quot;derivative work&quot; that **only** covers modifications to
TrailBase itself.
This means that your application&#039;s original code is **not** subject to the
OSL-3.0&#039;s copyleft provisions. This is true whether you connect over the
network (e.g. web, mobile, other services, etc.), you&#039;re serving static assets,
using the runtime to write custom server-side logic or using TrailBase as a
framework.

This limited scope is similar to the GPL&#039;s classpath or the LGPL&#039;s [linking
exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_linking_exception).
The goal is to allow building on top and around of TrailBase without any
provisions rubbing off onto your original work, while making sure that fixes
and improvements find their way back to the community.
These are our intentions - we felt the need to spell them out explicitly
because licensing is tricky and we ain&#039;t lawyers.
Graciously, the license&#039;s author provides some more
[explanations](https://rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0-explained.htm).
If you have any concerns, please reach out.

If you require an
[exception](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html), reach out
to contact@trailbase.io.

Lance is an open lakehouse format for multimodal AI. It contains a file format, table format, and catalog spec that allows you to build a complete lakehouse on top of object storage to power your AI workflows. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores with hybrid search capabilities.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and random access.
3. Storing, querying, and managing multimodal data including images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings.

The key features of Lance include:

* **Expressive hybrid search:** Combine vector similarity search, full-text search (BM25), and SQL analytics on the same dataset with accelerated secondary indices.

* **Lightning-fast random access:** 100x faster than Parquet or Iceberg for random access without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Native multimodal data support:** Store images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings in a single unified format with efficient blob encoding and lazy loading.

* **Data evolution:** Efficiently add columns with backfilled values without full table rewrites, perfect for ML feature engineering.

* **Zero-copy versioning:** ACID transactions, time travel, and automatic versioning without needing extra infrastructure.

* **Rich ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Apache Spark, Ray, Trino, Apache Flink, and open catalogs (Apache Polaris, Unity Catalog, Apache Gravitino).

For more details, see the full [Lance format specification](https://lance.org/format).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lance.org/community/contributing/) for more information.

## Quick Start

from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

## Why Lance for AI/ML workflows?

The machine learning development cycle involves multiple stages:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];
    E --&gt; F[Evaluation];
    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

Traditional lakehouse formats were designed for SQL analytics and struggle with AI/ML workloads that require:
- **Vector search** for similarity and semantic retrieval
- **Fast random access** for sampling and interactive exploration
- **Multimodal data** storage (images, videos, audio alongside embeddings)
- **Data evolution** for feature engineering without full table rewrites
- **Hybrid search** combining vectors, full-text, and SQL predicates

While existing formats (Parquet, Iceberg, Delta Lake) excel at SQL analytics, they require additional specialized systems for AI capabilities. Lance brings these AI-first features directly into the lakehouse format.

A comparison of different formats across ML development stages:

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

[examples/]: quiche/examples/

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.85 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

Zellij includes a built-in [web-client](https://zellij.dev/tutorials/web-client/), making a terminal optional.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Alloy

Alloy connects applications to blockchains.

Alloy is a rewrite of [`ethers-rs`] from the ground up, with exciting new
features, high performance, and excellent [docs](https://docs.rs/alloy).

We also have a [book](https://alloy.rs/) on all things Alloy and many [examples](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples) to help you get started.

## Installation

Alloy consists of a number of crates that provide a range of functionality essential for interfacing with any Ethereum-based blockchain.

The easiest way to get started is to add the `alloy` crate with the `full` feature flag from the command-line using Cargo:

```sh
cargo add alloy --features full
```

Alternatively, you can add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
alloy = { version = &quot;1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```

For a more fine-grained control over the features you wish to include, you can add the individual crates to your `Cargo.toml` file, or use the `alloy` crate with the features you need.

A comprehensive list of available features can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/alloy/latest/features) or in the [`alloy` crate&#039;s `Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/blob/main/crates/alloy/Cargo.toml).

## Examples

### Connecting to a Provider

Here&#039;s a simple example of connecting to an Ethereum node and querying the latest block:

```rust
use alloy::providers::{Provider, ProviderBuilder};

# async fn example() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
// Create a provider with the HTTP transport using the `reqwest` crate.
let rpc_url = &quot;https://eth.llamarpc.com&quot;;
let provider = ProviderBuilder::new().connect(rpc_url).await?;

// Get the latest block number.
let latest_block = provider.get_block_number().await?;
println!(&quot;Latest block number: {latest_block}&quot;);

// Get chain ID.
let chain_id = provider.get_chain_id().await?;
println!(&quot;Chain ID: {chain_id}&quot;);
# Ok(())
# }
```

### Network generic

Alloy is network-generic, allowing you to work with any Ethereum-compatible chain. Here&#039;s an example using Optimism (see [`op-alloy`](https://docs.rs/op-alloy)) to demonstrate this capability:

```rust,ignore
use alloy::providers::{Provider, ProviderBuilder};
use op_alloy::network::Optimism;

# async fn example() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
// Connect to Optimism mainnet.
let rpc_url = &quot;https://mainnet.optimism.io&quot;;
let provider = ProviderBuilder::new_with_network::&lt;Optimism&gt;().connect(rpc_url).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

For more examples, check out the [Alloy examples repository](https://github.com/alloy-rs/examples).

## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
--&gt;

The current MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is 1.88.

Alloy will keep a rolling MSRV policy of **at least** two versions behind the
latest stable release (so if the latest stable release is 1.58, we would
support 1.56).

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a patch
(pre-1.0) or minor (post-1.0) release.

## Contributing

Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have you! We have
[a contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get involved in the
Alloy project.

Pull requests will not be merged unless CI passes, so please ensure that your
contribution follows the linting rules and passes clippy.

## Note on `no_std`

Because these crates are primarily network-focused, we do not intend to support
`no_std` for most of them at this time.

The following crates support `no_std`:

| **alloy-consensus** | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/alloy-consensus.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-consensus) |

If you would like to add `no_std` support to a crate, please make sure to update
`scripts/check_no_std.sh` as well.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
workspace](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results in a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation.

## Why Cube?

As data infrastructure evolved from traditional relational databases to cloud data platforms, OLAP capabilities that once lived in specialized servers like SQL Server Analysis Services and Oracle Essbase were left behind. Today&#039;s organizations face several challenges:

1. __Analytics Modeling and Multidimensionality.__ Modern cloud data platforms excel at processing large volumes of data but lack native support for multidimensional analysis and modeling. Cube brings OLAP-style analytics to these platforms, enabling consistent metric definitions and multidimensional analysis.

2. __Performance Optimization.__ While cloud data warehouses have improved query performance through column-oriented storage and distributed processing, they still struggle with complex analytical workloads. Cube provides intelligent caching and pre-aggregation strategies that dramatically improve query response times.

3. __Access Control and Governance.__ Securing and governing access to data across all consuming applications remains critical. Cube offers robust access control to ensure consistent security across your entire data ecosystem.

4. __API Flexibility.__ Legacy OLAP tools were limited in how they exposed data. Cube provides modern REST, GraphQL, and SQL APIs along with support for traditional MDX and DAX interfaces, making it a truly universal semantic layer.

Cube is the missing OLAP engine for the cloud data platform era that provides the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations without duplicating analytics modeling, data, or security permissions across different tools.
