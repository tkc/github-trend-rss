## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

rustup default stable
# for pre-commit hooks the two following commands are required
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell shell

```shell
# zsh
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; &quot;${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc&quot;

# bash
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

# fish
echo &#039;mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

```shell
# Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks
pnpm install --ignore-scripts &amp;&amp; pnpm husky install
```

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| c5n.metal      | al2 linux_5.10   | ubuntu 24.04 | linux_5.10   |
| m5n.metal      | al2023 linux_6.1 |              | linux_6.1    |
| m6i.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m6a.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7a.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |
| m6g.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7g.metal      |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

# What&#039;s Hurl?

Hurl is a command line tool that runs &lt;b&gt;HTTP requests&lt;/b&gt; defined in a simple &lt;b&gt;plain text format&lt;/b&gt;.

It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very
versatile: it can be used for both &lt;b&gt;fetching data&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;testing HTTP&lt;/b&gt; sessions.

Hurl makes it easy to work with &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; content, &lt;b&gt;REST / SOAP / GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; APIs, or any other &lt;b&gt;XML / JSON&lt;/b&gt; based APIs. 

```hurl
# Get home:
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Captures]
csrf_token: xpath &quot;string(//meta[@name=&#039;_csrf_token&#039;]/@content)&quot;


# Do login!
POST https://example.org/login?user=toto&amp;password=1234
X-CSRF-TOKEN: {{csrf_token}}
HTTP 302
```

Chaining multiple requests is easy:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/health
GET https://example.org/api/step1
GET https://example.org/api/step2
GET https://example.org/api/step3
```

# Also an HTTP Test Tool

Hurl can run HTTP requests but can also be used to &lt;b&gt;test HTTP responses&lt;/b&gt;.
Different types of queries and predicates are supported, from [XPath] and [JSONPath] on body response,
to assert on status code and response headers.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://hurl.dev/player.html?id=starwars&amp;speed=3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/poster-starwars.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Hurl Demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


It is well adapted for &lt;b&gt;REST / JSON APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;4568&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
header &quot;X-Frame-Options&quot; == &quot;SAMEORIGIN&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.status&quot; == &quot;RUNNING&quot;    # Check the status code
jsonpath &quot;$.tests&quot; count == 25      # Check the number of items
jsonpath &quot;$.id&quot; matches /\d{4}/     # Check the format of the id
```

&lt;b&gt;HTML content&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;normalize-space(//head/title)&quot; == &quot;Hello world!&quot;
```

&lt;b&gt;GraphQL&lt;/b&gt; 

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
HTTP 200
~~~

and even &lt;b&gt;SOAP APIs&lt;/b&gt;

```hurl
POST https://example.org/InStock
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
SOAPAction: &quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot; xmlns:m=&quot;https://example.org&quot;&gt;
  &lt;soap:Header&gt;&lt;/soap:Header&gt;
  &lt;soap:Body&gt;
    &lt;m:GetStockPrice&gt;
      &lt;m:StockName&gt;GOOG&lt;/m:StockName&gt;
    &lt;/m:GetStockPrice&gt;
  &lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
HTTP 200
```

Hurl can also be used to test the &lt;b&gt;performance&lt;/b&gt; of HTTP endpoints

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/v1/pets
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
duration &lt; 1000  # Duration in ms
```

And check response bytes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

Finally, Hurl is easy to &lt;b&gt;integrate in CI/CD&lt;/b&gt;, with text, JUnit, TAP and HTML reports

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: light)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-dark.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/img/home-waterfall-light.png&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; alt=&quot;HTML report&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

# Why Hurl?

&lt;ul class=&quot;showcase-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Text Format:&lt;/b&gt; for both devops and developers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast CLI:&lt;/b&gt; a command line for local dev and continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single Binary:&lt;/b&gt; easy to install, with no runtime required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

# Powered by curl

Hurl is a lightweight binary written in [Rust]. Under the hood, Hurl HTTP engine is
powered by [libcurl], one of the most powerful and reliable file transfer libraries.
With its text file format, Hurl adds syntactic sugar to run and test HTTP requests,
but it&#039;s still the [curl] that we love: __fast__, __efficient__ and __IPv6 / HTTP/3 ready__.

# Feedbacks

To support its development, [star Hurl on GitHub]!

[Feedback, suggestion, bugs or improvements] are welcome.

```hurl
POST https://hurl.dev/api/feedback
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
  &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Hurl is awesome!&quot;
}
HTTP 200
```

# Samples

To run a sample, edit a file with the sample content, and run Hurl:

```shell
$ vi sample.hurl

GET https://example.org

$ hurl sample.hurl
```

By default, Hurl behaves like [curl] and outputs the last HTTP response&#039;s [entry]. To have a test
oriented output, you can use [`--test` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --test sample.hurl
```

A particular response can be saved with [`[Options] section`](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#options):

```hurl
GET https://example.ord/cats/123
[Options]
output: cat123.txt    # use - to output to stdout
HTTP 200

GET https://example.ord/dogs/567
HTTP 200
```

Finally, Hurl can take files as input, or directories. In the latter case, Hurl will search files with `.hurl` extension recursively.

```shell
$ hurl --test integration/*.hurl
$ hurl --test .
```

You can check [Hurl tests suite] for more samples.

## Getting Data

A simple GET:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
```

Requests can be chained:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/a
GET https://example.org/b
HEAD https://example.org/c
GET https://example.org/c
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#method)

### HTTP Headers

A simple GET with headers:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#headers)

### Query Params

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news
[Query]
order: newest
search: something to search
count: 100
```

Or:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/news?order=newest&amp;search=something%20to%20search&amp;count=100
```

&gt; With `[Query]` section, params don&#039;t need to be URL escaped.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#query-parameters)

### Basic Authentication

```hurl
GET https://example.org/protected
[BasicAuth]
bob: secret
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#basic-authentication)

This is equivalent to construct the request with a [Authorization] header:

```hurl
# Authorization header value can be computed with `echo -n &#039;bob:secret&#039; | base64`
GET https://example.org/protected
Authorization: Basic Ym9iOnNlY3JldA== 
```

Basic authentication section allows per request authentication. If you want to add basic authentication to all the
requests of a Hurl file you could use [`-u/--user` option]:

```shell
$ hurl --user bob:secret login.hurl
```

[`--user`] option can also be set per request:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: bob:secret
HTTP 200

GET https://example.org/login
[Options]
user: alice:secret
HTTP 200
```

### Passing Data between Requests 

[Captures] can be used to pass data from one request to another:

```hurl
POST https://sample.org/orders
HTTP 201
[Captures]
order_id: jsonpath &quot;$.order.id&quot;

GET https://sample.org/orders/{{order_id}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/capturing-response.html)

## Sending Data

### Sending HTML Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/contact
[Form]
default: false
token: {{token}}
email: john.doe@rookie.org
number: 33611223344
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#form-parameters)

### Sending Multipart Form Data

```hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
[Multipart]
field1: value1
field2: file,example.txt;
# One can specify the file content type:
field3: file,example.zip; application/zip
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multipart-form-data)

Multipart forms can also be sent with a [multiline string body]:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=&quot;boundary&quot;
```
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;key1&quot;

value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload1&quot;; filename=&quot;data.txt&quot;
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello World!
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;upload2&quot;; filename=&quot;data.html&quot;
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;div&gt;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
--boundary--
```
~~~

In that case, files have to be inlined in the Hurl file.

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)



### Posting a JSON Body

With an inline JSON:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;456&quot;,
    &quot;evaluate&quot;: true
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#json-body)

With a local file:

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/tests
Content-Type: application/json
file,data.json;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#file-body)

### Templating a JSON Body

```hurl
PUT https://example.org/api/hits
Content-Type: application/json
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;{{a_string}}&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: {{a_bool}},
    &quot;key2&quot;: {{a_null}},
    &quot;key3&quot;: {{a_number}}
}
```

Variables can be initialized via command line:

```shell
$ hurl --variable a_string=apple \
       --variable a_bool=true \
       --variable a_null=null \
       --variable a_number=42 \
       test.hurl
```

Resulting in a PUT request with the following JSON body:

```
{
    &quot;key0&quot;: &quot;apple&quot;,
    &quot;key1&quot;: true,
    &quot;key2&quot;: null,
    &quot;key3&quot;: 42
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html)

### Templating a XML Body

Using templates with [XML body] is not currently supported in Hurl. You can use templates in
[XML multiline string body] with variables to send a variable XML body:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/echo/post/xml
```xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Request&gt;
    &lt;Login&gt;{{login}}&lt;/Login&gt;
    &lt;Password&gt;{{password}}&lt;/Password&gt;
&lt;/Request&gt;
```
~~~

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#multiline-string-body)

### Using GraphQL Query

A simple GraphQL query:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
{
  human(id: &quot;1000&quot;) {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
~~~

A GraphQL query with variables:

~~~hurl
POST https://example.org/starwars/graphql
```graphql
query Hero($episode: Episode, $withFriends: Boolean!) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends @include(if: $withFriends) {
      name
    }
  }
}

variables {
  &quot;episode&quot;: &quot;JEDI&quot;,
  &quot;withFriends&quot;: false
}
```
~~~

GraphQL queries can also use [Hurl templates].

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/request.html#graphql-body)

### Using Dynamic Datas

[Functions] like `newUuid` and `newDate` can be used in templates to create dynamic datas:


A file that creates a dynamic email (i.e `0531f78f-7f87-44be-a7f2-969a1c4e6d97@test.com`):

```hurl
POST https://example.org/api/foo
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;,
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;{{newUuid}}@test.com&quot;
}
```

A file that creates a dynamic query parameter (i.e `2024-12-02T10:35:44.461731Z`):

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/foo
[Query]
date: {{newDate}}
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/templates.html#functions)

## Testing Response

Responses are optional, everything after `HTTP` is part of the response asserts.

```hurl
# A request with (almost) no check:
GET https://foo.com

# A status code check:
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200

# A test on response body
GET https://foo.com
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; == &quot;running&quot;
```

### Testing Status Code

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
HTTP 200
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#version-status)

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order/435
# Testing status code is in a 200-300 range
HTTP *
[Asserts]
status &gt;= 200
status &lt; 300
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#status-assert)


### Testing Response Headers

Use implicit response asserts to test header values:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#headers)


Or use explicit response asserts with [predicates]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 302
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#header-assert)

Implicit and explicit asserts can be combined:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
Set-Cookie: theme=light
Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
[Asserts]
header &quot;Location&quot; contains &quot;www.example.net&quot;
```

### Testing REST APIs

Asserting JSON body response (node values, collection count etc...) with [JSONPath]:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/order
screencapability: low
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
jsonpath &quot;$.validated&quot; == true
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.firstName&quot; == &quot;Franck&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.lastName&quot; == &quot;Herbert&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.hasDevice&quot; == false
jsonpath &quot;$.links&quot; count == 12
jsonpath &quot;$.state&quot; != null
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches &quot;^order-\\d{8}$&quot;
jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches /^order-\d{8}$/     # Alternative syntax with regex literal
jsonpath &quot;$.created&quot; isIsoDate
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#jsonpath-assert)


### Testing HTML Response

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[Asserts]
xpath &quot;string(/html/head/title)&quot; contains &quot;Example&quot; # Check title
xpath &quot;count(//p)&quot; == 2  # Check the number of p
xpath &quot;//p&quot; count == 2  # Similar assert for p
xpath &quot;boolean(count(//h2))&quot; == false  # Check there is no h2  
xpath &quot;//h2&quot; not exists  # Similar assert for h2
xpath &quot;string(//div[1])&quot; matches /Hello.*/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#xpath-assert)

### Testing Set-Cookie Attributes

```hurl
GET https://example.org/home
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Value]&quot; == &quot;8400BAFE2F66443613DC38AE3D9D6239&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Expires]&quot; contains &quot;Wed, 13 Jan 2021&quot;
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[Secure]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[HttpOnly]&quot; exists
cookie &quot;JSESSIONID[SameSite]&quot; == &quot;Lax&quot;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#cookie-assert)

### Testing Bytes Content

Check the SHA-256 response body hash:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/data.tar.gz
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
sha256 == hex,039058c6f2c0cb492c533b0a4d14ef77cc0f78abccced5287d84a1a2011cfb81;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#sha-256-assert)

### SSL Certificate

Check the properties of a SSL certificate:

```hurl
GET https://example.org
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
certificate &quot;Subject&quot; == &quot;CN=example.org&quot;
certificate &quot;Issuer&quot; == &quot;C=US, O=Let&#039;s Encrypt, CN=R3&quot;
certificate &quot;Expire-Date&quot; daysAfterNow &gt; 15
certificate &quot;Serial-Number&quot; matches /[\da-f]+/
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#ssl-certificate-assert)

### Checking Full Body

Use implicit body to test an exact JSON body match:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/cats/123
HTTP 200
{
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Purrsloud&quot;,
  &quot;species&quot; : &quot;Cat&quot;,
  &quot;favFoods&quot; : [&quot;wet food&quot;, &quot;dry food&quot;, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; food&quot;],
  &quot;birthYear&quot; : 2016,
  &quot;photo&quot; : &quot;https://learnwebcode.github.io/json-example/images/cat-2.jpg&quot;
}
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#json-body)

Or an explicit assert file:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/index.html
HTTP 200
[Asserts]
body == file,cat.json;
```

[Doc](https://hurl.dev/docs/asserting-response.html#body-assert)

Implicit asserts supports XML body:

```hurl
GET https://example.org/api/catalog
HTTP 200
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;catalog&gt;
   &lt;book id=&quot;bk101&quot;&gt;
      &lt;author&gt;Gambardella, Matthew&lt;/author&gt;

![Current Stable Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/release-registry/main/badges/polkadot-sdk-latest.svg)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;![Next Stable Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/release-registry/main/badges/polkadot-sdk-next.svg)

The Polkadot SDK is released every three months as a `stableYYMM` release. They are supported for
one year with patches. See the next upcoming versions in the [Release
Registry](https://github.com/paritytech/release-registry/) and more docs in [RELEASE.md](./docs/RELEASE.md).

You can use [`psvm`](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm) to update all dependencies to a specific
version without needing to manually select the correct version for each crate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling

[Polkadot SDK Version Manager](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm):
A simple tool to manage and update the Polkadot SDK dependencies in any Cargo.toml file.
It will automatically update the Polkadot SDK dependencies to their correct crates.io version.

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).

### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways you can contribute to Zed.

Also... we&#039;re hiring! Check out our [jobs](https://zed.dev/jobs) page for open roles.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

***If you&#039;ll click on the image, you&#039;ll be led to an SVG version of it on the website where you can directly click on every issue***

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÑŸäÿ¨, romanized: zillƒ´j; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we‚Äôve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:
* We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    * Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    * Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
* We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.
* We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
* We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
* We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth Book](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.85.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html).

See the book for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source.html).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
# Without Geth
cargo test --workspace

# With Geth
cargo test --workspace --features geth-tests

# With Ethereum Foundation tests
#
# Note: Requires cloning https://github.com/ethereum/tests
#
#   cd testing/ef-tests &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/ethereum/tests ethereum-tests
cargo test -p ef-tests --features ef-tests
```

We recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing. With nextest installed, simply substitute `cargo test` with `cargo nextest run`.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [book][book].

If the answer is not there:

- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This project is no longer dormant and is [being

&gt; Please contribute!

## Goal

The Rust CUDA Project is a project aimed at making Rust a tier-1 language for extremely fast GPU computing
using the CUDA Toolkit. It provides tools for compiling Rust to extremely fast PTX code as well as libraries
for using existing CUDA libraries with it.

## Background

Historically, general purpose high performance GPU computing has been done using the CUDA toolkit. The CUDA toolkit primarily
provides a way to use Fortran/C/C++ code for GPU computing in tandem with CPU code with a single source. It also provides
many libraries, tools, forums, and documentation to supplement the single-source CPU/GPU code.

CUDA is exclusively an NVIDIA-only toolkit. Many tools have been proposed for cross-platform GPU computing such as
OpenCL, Vulkan Computing, and HIP. However, CUDA remains the most used toolkit for such tasks by far. This is why it is
imperative to make Rust a viable option for use with the CUDA toolkit.

However, CUDA with Rust has been a historically very rocky road. The only viable option until now has been to use the LLVM PTX
backend, however, the LLVM PTX backend does not always work and would generate invalid PTX for many common Rust operations, and
in recent years it has been shown time and time again that a specialized solution is needed for Rust on the GPU with the advent
of projects such as rust-gpu (for Rust -&gt; SPIR-V).

Our hope is that with this project we can push the Rust GPU computing industry forward and make Rust an excellent language
for such tasks. Rust offers plenty of benefits such as `__restrict__` performance benefits for every kernel, An excellent module/crate system,
delimiting of unsafe areas of CPU/GPU code with `unsafe`, high level wrappers to low level CUDA libraries, etc.

## Structure

The scope of the Rust CUDA Project is quite broad, it spans the entirety of the CUDA ecosystem, with libraries and tools to make it
usable using Rust. Therefore, the project contains many crates for all corners of the CUDA ecosystem.

The current line-up of libraries is the following:

- `rustc_codegen_nvvm` Which is a rustc backend that targets NVVM IR (a subset of LLVM IR) for the [libnvvm](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/index.html) library.
  - Generates highly optimized PTX code which can be loaded by the CUDA Driver API to execute on the GPU.
  - For the near future it will be CUDA-only, but it may be used to target amdgpu in the future.
- `cuda_std` for GPU-side functions and utilities, such as thread index queries, memory allocation, warp intrinsics, etc.
  - _Not_ a low level library, provides many utility functions to make it easier to write cleaner and more reliable GPU kernels.
  - Closely tied to `rustc_codegen_nvvm` which exposes GPU features through it internally.
- [`cudnn`](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/tree/master/crates/cudnn) for a collection of GPU-accelerated primitives for deep neural networks.
- `cust` for CPU-side CUDA features such as launching GPU kernels, GPU memory allocation, device queries, etc.
  - High level with features such as RAII and Rust Results that make it easier and cleaner to manage the interface to the GPU.
  - A high level wrapper for the CUDA Driver API, the lower level version of the more common CUDA Runtime API used from C++.
  - Provides much more fine grained control over things like kernel concurrency and module loading than the C++ Runtime API.
- `gpu_rand` for GPU-friendly random number generation, currently only implements xoroshiro RNGs from `rand_xoshiro`.
- `optix` for CPU-side hardware raytracing and denoising using the CUDA OptiX library.

In addition to many &quot;glue&quot; crates for things such as high level wrappers for certain smaller CUDA libraries.

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.72.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.72.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your friendly neighborhood package manager).
Then you just need to add MUSL support to your Rust toolchain and rebuild
ripgrep, which yields a fully static executable:

```
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Applying the `--features` flag from above works as expected. If you want to
build a static executable with MUSL and with PCRE2, then you will need to have
`musl-gcc` installed, which might be in a separate package from the actual
MUSL library, depending on your Linux distribution.


### Running tests

ripgrep is relatively well-test

# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data

```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=16 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

__Cube is the semantic layer for building data applications.__ It helps data engineers and application developers access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.

&lt;/p&gt;

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation.

## Why Cube?

If you are building a data application‚Äîsuch as a business intelligence tool or a customer-facing analytics feature‚Äîyou‚Äôll probably face the following problems:

1. __SQL code organization.__ Sooner or later, modeling even a dozen metrics with a dozen dimensions using pure SQL queries becomes a maintenance nightmare, which leads to building a modeling framework.
2. __Performance.__ Most of the time and effort in modern analytics software development is spent providing adequate time to insight. In a world where every company‚Äôs data is big data, writing just SQL queries to get insight isn‚Äôt enough anymore.
3. __Access Control.__ It is important to secure and govern access to data for all downstream data consuming applications.

Cube has the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations so that every application‚Äîlike embedded analytics, dashboarding and reporting tools, data notebooks, and other tools‚Äîcan access consistent data via REST, SQL, and GraphQL APIs.

# bootc

Transactional, in-place operating system updates using OCI/Docker container images.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using &quot;layers&quot; to model
applications has been extremely successful.  This project
aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using
standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format
for base operating system updates.

The container image includes a Linux kernel (in e.g. `/usr/lib/modules`),
which is used to boot.  At runtime on a target system, the base userspace is
*not* itself running in a &quot;container&quot; by default. For example, assuming
systemd is in use, systemd acts as pid1 as usual - there&#039;s no &quot;outer&quot; process.
More about this in the docs; see below.

## Status

The CLI and API are considered stable. We will ensure that every existing system
can be upgraded in place seamlessly across any future changes.

## Documentation

See the [project documentation](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/).

## Adopters (base and end-user images)

The bootc CLI is just a client system; it is not tied to any particular
operating system or Linux distribution. You very likely want to actually
start by looking at [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md).

## Community discussion

The [Github discussion forum](https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussions) is enabled.

This project is also tightly related to the previously mentioned Fedora/CentOS bootc project,
and many developers monitor the relevant discussion forums there. In particular there&#039;s a
Matrix channel and a weekly video call meeting for example: &lt;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/community/&gt;.

## Developing bootc

There is also a list of [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

## Governance

### Code of Conduct

The bootc project is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/)
and adheres to the [CNCF Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

This is a simple graphical user interface for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (an
aggressively refactored and updated Vim editor). Where possible there are some graphical
improvements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.

## Author Notes

I&#039;ve been using this as my daily driver since November 2019. It should be relatively stable, but I&#039;m
still working out some kinks and ironing out some cross platform issues. In general it should be
usable at this point, and if it isn&#039;t I consider that a bug and appreciate a report in the issues!
Any help and ideas are also greatly appreciated.

I&#039;m also very interested in suggestions code quality/style wise when it comes to Rust. I&#039;m pretty
new to the language and appreciate any critiques that you might have to offer. I won&#039;t take all of
them, but I promise to consider anything you might have to offer.

[ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is an Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. We&#039;re modernizing the features of Elasticsearch&#039;s product suite, starting with real-time search and analytics.

## Roadmap

- [x] Search
  - [x] Full-text search with BM25 with [pg_search](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_search#overview)
  - [x] Dense and sparse vector search with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#pgvector)
  - [ ] Distributed search
- [ ] Analytics
  - [x] Fast analytics over data lakes (i.e. S3) and table formats (i.e. Iceberg) with [pg_analytics](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics)
  - [ ] Column-oriented Postgres table access method

For a detailed roadmap, see the [ParadeDB Roadmap for 2025](https://github.com/orgs/paradedb/discussions/2041).

## Get Started

To get started, please visit our [documentation](https://docs.paradedb.com).

## Deploying ParadeDB

ParadeDB and its extensions can be deployed in one of two ways:

- Docker image based on [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) ([see deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/aws))
- Kubernetes Helm chart based on [CloudNativePG](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg) ([see deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/helm))

For more information, including enterprise features and support, please [contact us by email](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

### Extensions

You can find prebuilt binaries for the ParadeDB Postgres extensions on Debian 11, 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9, and macOS 14 (Sonoma) and 15 (Sequoia) for Postgres 14+ in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest).

ParadeDB supports all versions supported by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, which includes PostgreSQL 13+, and you can compile the extensions for other versions of Postgres by following the instructions in the respective extension&#039;s README.

### Docker Image

To quickly get a ParadeDB instance up and running, simply pull and run the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker run --name paradedb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password paradedb/paradedb
```

This will start a ParadeDB instance with default user `postgres` and password `password`. You can then connect to the database using `psql`:

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U postgres
```

To install ParadeDB locally or on-premise, we recommend using our `docker-compose.yml` file. Alternatively, you can pass the appropriate environment variables to the `docker run` command, replacing the &lt;&gt; with your desired values:

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=&lt;user&gt; \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=&lt;password&gt; \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=&lt;dbname&gt; \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

This will start a ParadeDB instance with non-root user `&lt;user&gt;` and password `&lt;password&gt;`. The `-v` flag enables your ParadeDB data to persist across restarts in a Docker volume named `paradedb_data`.

You can then connect to the database using `psql`:

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U &lt;user&gt; -d &lt;dbname&gt; -p 5432 -W
```

ParadeDB collects anonymous telemetry to help us understand how many people are using the project. You can opt out of telemetry using configuration variables within Postgres:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_search_telemetry TO &#039;off&#039;;
```

### Helm Chart

ParadeDB is also available for Kubernetes via our Helm chart. You can find our Helm chart in the [ParadeDB Helm Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/paradedb/charts) or download it directly from [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paradedb/paradedb).

### ParadeDB Cloud

At the moment, ParadeDB is not available as a managed cloud service. If you are interested in a ParadeDB Cloud service, please let us know by joining our [waitlist](https://form.typeform.com/to/jHkLmIzx).

## Support

If you&#039;re missing a feature or have found a bug, please open a
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/issues/new/choose).

This is the OpenVAS Scanner of the Greenbone Community Edition.

It is used for the Greenbone Enterprise appliances and is a full-featured
scan engine that executes a continuously updated and extended feed of
Vulnerability Tests (VTs).

## Releases

All [release files](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas/releases) are signed with
the [Greenbone Community Feed integrity key](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gcf-managing-the-digital-signatures/101).
This gpg key can be downloaded at https://www.greenbone.net/GBCommunitySigningKey.asc
and the fingerprint is `8AE4 BE42 9B60 A59B 311C  2E73 9823 FAA6 0ED1 E580`.

## Installation

This module can be configured, built and installed with following commands:

    cmake .
    make install

For detailed installation requirements and instructions, please see the file
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The file also contains instructions for setting up
`openvas` and for making the scanner available to other GVM modules.

If you are not familiar or comfortable building from source code, we recommend
that you use the Greenbone Enterprise TRIAL, a prepared virtual
machine with a readily available setup. Information regarding the virtual machine
is available at &lt;https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow&gt;.

## Rust Implementation

This repository also consists of a [rust project](rust/README.md) aiming to replace the current scanner stack
(openvas-scanner, ospd-openvas, notus-scanner). It simplifies the use of the scanner and centralizes
everything needed for scanning. Currently it uses the openvas-scanner as scan engine.

## Docker, [Greenbone Community Containers](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/)

If you want to use the docker files provided in this repository you can pull them 
from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/greenbone/openvas-scanner). You can also locally 
build them using:
```
docker build -t &lt;image-name&gt; -f .docker/prod.Dockerfile .
```
For more information about building docker images, see 
[official man](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).
We also provide a [fully containerized 
solution](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/)
for the Greenbone Community Edition.

&gt; Please beware: The Greenbone Community Container are currently under development.

Verus is a tool for verifying the correctness of code written in Rust.
Developers write specifications of what their code should do,
and Verus statically checks that the executable Rust code will always 
satisfy the specifications for all possible executions of the code.
Rather than adding run-time checks, Verus instead relies on powerful solvers to
prove the code is correct.  Verus currently supports a subset of Rust (which we
are working to expand), and in some cases, it allows developers to go beyond
the standard Rust type system and statically check the correctness of code
that, for example, manipulates raw pointers.

## Status

Verus is under *active development*. Features may be broken and/or missing, and
the documentation is still incomplete. If you want to try Verus, please be
prepared to ask for help in the [üí¨ Zulip](https://verus-lang.zulipchat.com/).

The Verus community has published a number of research papers, and there are a
variety of industry and academic projects using Verus. You can find a list on our
&lt;a href=&quot;https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/publications-and-projects/&quot;&gt;publications and projects&lt;/a&gt; page. 
If you&#039;re using Verus please consider adding your project to that page (see the instructions there).

## Try Verus

To try Verus in your browser, please visit the [Verus Playground](https://play.verus-lang.org/).
For more involved development, please follow our [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).
Then you can dive into the documentation below, starting
with the [üìñ Tutorial and reference](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/guide/).
We also support an auto-formatter ([verusfmt](https://github.com/verus-lang/verusfmt)) for your
Verus code.

## Getting in touch, reporting issues, and starting discussions

Please report issues or start discussions here on GitHub, or join us on [üí¨ Zulip](https://verus-lang.zulipchat.com/) for more realtime discussions and if you need help. Thank you for using and contributing to Verus!

We use GitHub discussions for feature requests and more open-ended conversations about
upcoming features, and we reserve GitHub issues for actionable issues (bugs) with
existing features. Don&#039;t worry though: if we think an issue should be a discussion (or
vice versa) we can always move it later.

We welcome contributions! If you&#039;d like to contribute code, have a look at the tips in
[Contributing to Verus](CONTRIBUTING.md).
