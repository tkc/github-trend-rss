            <h2>README</h2><pre># Overview

libsignal contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, exposed
as a Java, Swift, or TypeScript library. The underlying implementations are written in Rust:

- libsignal-protocol: Implements the Signal protocol, including the [Double Ratchet algorithm][]. A
  replacement for [libsignal-protocol-java][] and [libsignal-metadata-java][].
- signal-crypto: Cryptographic primitives such as AES-GCM. We use [RustCrypto][]&#039;s where we can
  but sometimes have differing needs.
- device-transfer: Support logic for Signal&#039;s device-to-device transfer feature.
- attest: Functionality for remote attestation of [SGX enclaves][] and server-side [HSMs][].
- zkgroup: Functionality for [zero-knowledge groups][] and related features available in Signal.
- zkcredential: An abstraction for the sort of zero-knowledge credentials used by zkgroup, based on the paper &quot;[The Signal Private Group System][]&quot; by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha.
- poksho: Utilities for implementing zero-knowledge proofs (such as those used by zkgroup); stands for &quot;proof-of-knowledge, stateful-hash-object&quot;.
- account-keys: Functionality for consistently using [PINs][] as passwords in Signal&#039;s Secure Value Recovery system, as well as other account-wide key operations.
- usernames: Functionality for username generation, hashing, and proofs.
- media: Utilities for manipulating media.

This repository is used by the Signal client apps ([Android][], [iOS][], and [Desktop][]) as well as
server-side. Use outside of Signal is unsupported. In particular, the products of this repository
are the Java, Swift, and TypeScript libraries that wrap the underlying Rust implementations. All
APIs and implementations are subject to change without notice, as are the JNI, C, and Node add-on
&quot;bridge&quot; layers. However, backwards-incompatible changes to the Java, Swift, TypeScript, and
non-bridge Rust APIs will be reflected in the version number on a best-effort basis, including
increases to the minimum supported tools versions.

# Building

### Toolchain Installation

To build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed,
as well as Clang, libclang, [CMake](https://cmake.org), Make, protoc, and git.

#### Linux/Debian

On a Debian-like system, you can get these extra dependencies through `apt`:

```shell
$ apt-get install clang libclang-dev cmake make protobuf-compiler git
```

#### macOS

On macOS, we have a best-effort maintained script to set up the Rust toolchain you can run by:

```shell
$ bin/mac_setup.sh
```

## Rust

### First Build and Test

The build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which
will be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol
libraries:

```shell
$ cargo build
...
$ cargo test
...
```

### Additional Rust Tools

The basic tools above should get you set up for most libsignal Rust development. 

Eventually, you may find that you need some additional Rust tools like `cbindgen` to modify the bridges to the 
client libraries or `taplo` for code formatting. 

You should always install any Rust tools you need that may affect the build from cargo rather than from your system
package manager (e.g. `apt` or `brew`). Package managers sometimes contain outdated versions of these tools that can break
the build with incompatibility issues (especially cbindgen).

To install the main Rust extra dependencies matching the versions we use, you can run the following commands: 

```shell
$ cargo +stable install cbindgen cargo-fuzz
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat ../acknowledgments/cargo-about-version)&quot; --locked cargo-about
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat ../.taplo-cli-version)&quot; --locked taplo-cli
```

## Java/Android

### Toolchain Setup / Configuration

To build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,
the Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using

```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```

Our officially supported JDK version for Android builds is JDK 17, so be sure to install e.g. OpenJDK 17, and then point JAVA_HOME to it.

You can easily do this on macOS via:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
```

On Linux, the way you do this varies by distribution. For Debian based distributions like Ubuntu, you can use:

```shell
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

We also check-in a `.tools_version` file for use with runtime version managers.

### Building and Testing

To build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:

```shell
$ cd java
$ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew build # if you need AAR outputs
```

You can pass `-P debugLevelLogs` to Gradle to build without filtering out debug- and verbose-level
logs from Rust, and `-P jniTypeTagging` to enable additional checks in the Rust JNI bridging code.

Alternately, a build system using Docker is available:

```shell
$ cd java
$ make
```

When exposing new APIs to Java, you will need to run `rust/bridge/jni/bin/gen_java_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding. This requires installing the `cbindgen` Rust tool, as detailed above. 

### Maven Central

Signal publishes Java packages on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org) for its own use,
under the names org.signal:libsignal-server, org.signal:libsignal-client, and
org.signal:libsignal-android. libsignal-client and libsignal-server contain native libraries for
Debian-flavored x86_64 Linux as well as Windows (x86_64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64).
libsignal-android contains native libraries for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64 Android.

When building for Android you need *both* libsignal-android and libsignal-client, but the Windows
and macOS libraries in libsignal-client won&#039;t automatically be excluded from your final app. You can
explicitly exclude them using `packagingOptions`:

```
android {
  // ...
  packagingOptions {
    resources {
      excludes += setOf(&quot;libsignal_jni*.dylib&quot;, &quot;signal_jni*.dll&quot;)
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can additionally exclude `libsignal_jni_testing.so` if you do not plan to use any of the APIs
intended for client testing.


## Swift

To learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)


## Node

You&#039;ll need Node installed to build. If you have [nvm][], you can run `nvm use` to select an
appropriate version automatically.

We use `npm` as our package manager, and a Python script to control building the Rust library, accessible as `npm run build`.

```shell
$ cd node
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run tsc
$ npm run test
```

When testing changes locally, you can use `npm run build` to do an incremental rebuild of the Rust library. Alternately, `npm run build-with-debug-level-logs` will rebuild without filtering out debug- and verbose-level logs.

When exposing new APIs to Node, you will need to run `rust/bridge/node/bin/gen_ts_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding.

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

### NPM

Signal publishes the NPM package `@signalapp/libsignal-client` for its own use, including native
libraries for Windows, macOS, and Debian-flavored Linux. Both x64 and arm64 builds are included for
all three platforms, but the arm64 builds for Windows and Linux are considered experimental, since
there are no official builds of Signal for those architectures.


# Contributions

Signal does accept external contributions to this project. However unless the change is
simple and easily understood, for example fixing a bug or portability issue, adding a new
test, or improving performance, first open an issue to discuss your intended change as not
all changes can be accepted.

Contributions that will not be used directly by one of Signal&#039;s official client apps may still be
considered, but only if they do not pose an undue maintenance burden or conflict with the goals of
the project.

Signing a [CLA (Contributor License Agreement)](https://signal.org/cla/) is required for all contributions.

## Code Formatting and Acknowledgments

You can run the styler on the entire project by running:

```shell
just format-all
```

You can run more extensive tests as well as linters and clippy by running:

```shell
just check-pre-commit
```

When making a PR that adjusts dependencies, you&#039;ll need to regenerate our acknowledgments files. See [``acknowledgments/README.md``](acknowledgments/).

[English] | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here](https://discord.gg/jR3tfchVvW)

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Workspaces.html) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Window-Rules.html#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Screencasting.html#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Tabs.html)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Layout.html#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config
- Works with [screen readers](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Accessibility.html)

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html) page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out [awesome-niri], a list of niri-related links and projects.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee¬†PC¬†900 from¬†2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: [integrated](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite) via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow and Apache Parquet

Welcome to the [Rust][rust] implementation of [Apache Arrow], the popular in-memory columnar format.

This repository contains the following crates:

| Crate              | Description                                                                  | Latest API Docs                                  | README                            |

| [`arrow-flight`]   | Support for Arrow-Flight IPC protocol                                        | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/arrow-flight/latest)   | [(README)][flight-readme]         |
| [`parquet`]        | Support for Parquet columnar file format                                     | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/parquet/latest)        | [(README)][parquet-readme]        |
| [`parquet_derive`] | A crate for deriving RecordWriter/RecordReader for arbitrary, simple structs | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/parquet-derive/latest) | [(README)][parquet-derive-readme] |

The current development version the API documentation in this repo can be found [here](https://arrow.apache.org/rust).

Note: previously the [`object_store`] crate was also part of this repository,
but it has been moved to the [arrow-rs-object-store repository]

## Release Versioning and Schedule

The Arrow Rust project releases approximately monthly and follows [Semantic
Versioning].

Due to available maintainer and testing bandwidth, [`arrow`] crates ([`arrow`],
[`arrow-flight`], etc.) are released on the same schedule with the same versions
as the [`parquet`] and [`parquet-derive`] crates.

This crate releases every month. We release new major versions (with potentially
breaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor
versions in the intervening months. See [ticket #5368] for more details.

To keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major
and minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes
is described in the [contributing] guide.

[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes

Planned Release Schedule

| Approximate Date | Version    | Notes                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| October 2025     | [`57.0.0`] | Major, potentially breaking API changes |
| November 2025    | [`57.1.0`] | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |
| December 2025    | [`57.2.0`] | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |
| January 2026     | [`58.0.0`] | Major, potentially breaking API changes |

[`58.0.0`]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/milestone/6
[ticket #5368]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5368
[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/

### Rust Version Compatibility Policy

arrow-rs and parquet are built and tested with stable Rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) that can only be updated in major releases on a need by basis (e.g. project dependencies bump their MSRV or a particular Rust feature is useful for us etc.). The new MSRV if selected will be at least 6 months old. The minor releases are guaranteed to have the same MSRV.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

### Guidelines for `panic` vs `Result`

In general, use panics for bad states that are unreachable, unrecoverable or harmful.
For those caused by invalid user input, however, we prefer to report that invalidity
gracefully as an error result instead of panicking. In general, invalid input should result
in an `Error` as soon as possible. It _is_ ok for code paths after validation to assume
validation has already occurred and panic if not. See [ticket #6737] for more nuances.

[ticket #6737]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6737

### Deprecation Guidelines

Minor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows
downstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This
gives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.

To deprecate an API:

- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated
- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition

The deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please
consult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the
`#[deprecated(since = &quot;...&quot;, note = &quot;...&quot;)]` attribute.

For example

```rust
#[deprecated(since = &quot;51.0.0&quot;, note = &quot;Use `date_part` instead&quot;)]
```

In general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after
they were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API
deprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs
may be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the
maintainers.

Collectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.

For example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the
[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),
evaluate it in-memory using Arrow&#039;s columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),
and send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).

Generally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow
arrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,
including `join`s and window functions.

You can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.

## Arrow Rust Community

The `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.

The Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is
a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:

1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list
2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]
3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)

The Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and
this plays a critical role in the release process.

For design discussions we generally use GitHub issues.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

CocoIndex makes it effortless to transform data with AI, and keep source data and target in sync. Whether you‚Äôre building a vector index for RAG, creating knowledge graphs, or performing any custom data transformations ‚Äî goes beyond SQL.

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot; src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/venn2.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;



## Exceptional velocity
Just declare transformation in dataflow with ~100 lines of python

```python
# import
data[&#039;content&#039;] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data[&#039;out&#039;] = data[&#039;content&#039;]
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, developers don&#039;t explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. They just need to define transformation/formula for a set of source data.

## Plug-and-Play Building Blocks
Native builtins for different source, targets and transformations. Standardize interface, make it 1-line code switch between different components - as easy as assembling building blocks.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/components.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Data Freshness
CocoIndex keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4eb29b3-84ee-4fa0-a1e2-80eedeeabde6&quot; alt=&quot;Incremental Processing&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It has out-of-box support for incremental indexing:
- minimal recomputation on source or logic change.
- (re-)processing necessary portions; reuse cache when possible

## Quick Start:
If you&#039;re new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out
- üìñ [Documentation](https://cocoindex.io/docs)
- ‚ö°  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- üé¨ [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```bash
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don&#039;t have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.


## Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name=&quot;TextEmbedding&quot;)
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path=&quot;markdown_files&quot;))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc[&quot;chunks&quot;] = doc[&quot;content&quot;].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=&quot;markdown&quot;, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc[&quot;chunks&quot;].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;] = chunk[&quot;text&quot;].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model=&quot;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&quot;))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc[&quot;filename&quot;], location=chunk[&quot;location&quot;],
                                   text=chunk[&quot;text&quot;], embedding=chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        &quot;doc_embeddings&quot;,
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=[&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;location&quot;],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name=&quot;embedding&quot;,
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:

## Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust

Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use
and expressive. Key features are:

- Lazy | Eager execution
- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Query optimization
- Multi-threaded
- Written in Rust
- SIMD
- Powerful expression API
- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL
- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming.

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

## Managed/Distributed Polars

Do you want a managed solution or scale out to distributed clusters? Consider our
[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars[rt64]`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars[rtcompat]`. This version of
Polars is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target
features.

&lt;/div&gt;

Vello is a 2D graphics rendering engine written in Rust, with a focus on GPU compute.
It can draw large 2D scenes with interactive or near-interactive performance, using [`wgpu`] for GPU access.

Quickstart to run an example program:

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit
```

![image](https://github.com/linebender/vello/assets/8573618/cc2b742e-2135-4b70-8051-c49aeddb5d19)

It is used as the rendering backend for [Xilem], a Rust GUI toolkit.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Vello can currently be considered in an alpha state. In particular, we&#039;re still working on the following:
&gt;
&gt; - [Implementing blur and filter effects](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/476).
&gt; - [Conflations artifacts](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/49).
&gt; - [GPU memory allocation strategy](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/366)
&gt; - [Glyph caching](https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/204)

Significant changes are documented in [the changelog].

## Motivation

Vello is meant to fill the same place in the graphics stack as other vector graphics renderers like [Skia](https://skia.org/), [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), and its predecessor project [Piet](https://github.com/linebender/piet).
On a basic level, that means it provides tools to render shapes, images, gradients, text, etc, using a PostScript-inspired API, the same that powers SVG files and [the browser `&lt;canvas&gt;` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).

Vello&#039;s selling point is that it gets better performance than other renderers by better leveraging the GPU.
In traditional PostScript-style renderers, some steps of the render process like sorting and clipping either need to be handled in the CPU or done through the use of intermediary textures.
Vello avoids this by using prefix-sum algorithms to parallelize work that usually needs to happen in sequence, so that work can be offloaded to the GPU with minimal use of temporary buffers.

This means that Vello needs a GPU with support for compute shaders to run.

## Getting started

Vello is meant to be integrated deep in UI render stacks.
While drawing in a Vello scene is easy, actually rendering that scene to a surface requires setting up a wgpu context, which is a non-trivial task.

To use Vello as the renderer for your PDF reader / GUI toolkit / etc, your code will have to look roughly like this:

```rust
use vello::{
    kurbo::{Affine, Circle},
    peniko::{Color, Fill},
    *,
};

// Initialize wgpu and get handles
let (width, height) = ...;
let device: wgpu::Device = ...;
let queue: wgpu::Queue = ...;
let mut renderer = Renderer::new(
   &amp;device,
   RendererOptions::default()
).expect(&quot;Failed to create renderer&quot;);
// Create scene and draw stuff in it
let mut scene = vello::Scene::new();
scene.fill(
   vello::peniko::Fill::NonZero,
   vello::Affine::IDENTITY,
   vello::Color::from_rgb8(242, 140, 168),
   None,
   &amp;vello::Circle::new((420.0, 200.0), 120.0),
);
// Draw more stuff
scene.push_layer(...);
scene.fill(...);
scene.stroke(...);
scene.pop_layer(...);
let texture = device.create_texture(&amp;...);

// Render to a wgpu Texture
renderer
   .render_to_texture(
      &amp;device,
      &amp;queue,
      &amp;scene,
      &amp;texture,
      &amp;vello::RenderParams {
         base_color: palette::css::BLACK, // Background color
         width,
         height,
         antialiasing_method: AaConfig::Msaa16,
      },
   )
   .expect(&quot;Failed to render to a texture&quot;);
// Do things with `texture`, such as blitting it to the Surface using
// wgpu::util::TextureBlitter
```

See the [`examples`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) directory for code that integrates with frameworks like winit.

## Performance

We&#039;ve observed 177 fps for the paris-30k test scene on an M1 Max, at a resolution of 1600 pixels square, which is excellent performance and represents something of a best case for the engine.

More formal benchmarks are on their way.

## Integrations

### SVG

A separate Linebender integration for rendering SVG files is available through [`vello_svg`](https://github.com/linebender/vello_svg).

### Lottie

A separate Linebender integration for playing Lottie animations is available through [`velato`](https://github.com/linebender/velato).

### Bevy

A separate Linebender integration for rendering raw scenes or Lottie and SVG files in [Bevy] through [`bevy_vello`](https://github.com/linebender/bevy_vello).

## Examples

Our examples are provided in separate packages in the [`examples`](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples) directory.
This allows them to have independent dependencies and faster builds.
Examples must be selected using the `--package` (or `-p`) Cargo flag.

### Winit

Our [winit] example ([examples/with_winit](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples/with_winit)) demonstrates rendering to a [winit] window.
By default, this renders the [GhostScript Tiger] as well as all SVG files you add in the [examples/assets/downloads](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/examples/assets/downloads) directory.
A custom list of SVG file paths (and directories to render all SVG files from) can be provided as arguments instead.
It also includes a collection of test scenes showing the capabilities of `vello`, which can be shown with `--test-scenes`.

```shell
cargo run -p with_winit
```

&lt;!-- ### Headless --&gt;

## Platforms

We aim to target all environments which can support WebGPU with the [default limits](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#limits).
We defer to [`wgpu`] for this support.
Other platforms are more tricky, and may require special building/running procedures.

### Web

Because Vello relies heavily on compute shaders, we rely on the emerging WebGPU standard to run on the web.
Browser support for WebGPU is still evolving.
Vello has been tested using production versions of Chrome, but WebGPU support in Firefox and Safari is still experimental.
It may be necessary to use development browsers and explicitly enable WebGPU.

The following command builds and runs a web version of the [winit demo](#winit).
This uses [`cargo-run-wasm`](https://github.com/rukai/cargo-run-wasm) to build the example for web, and host a local server for it

```shell
# Make sure the Rust toolchain supports the wasm32 target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# The binary name must also be explicitly provided as it differs from the package name
cargo run_wasm -p with_winit --bin with_winit_bin
```

There is also a web demo [available here](https://linebender.github.io/vello) on supporting web browsers.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The web is not currently a primary target for Vello, and WebGPU implementations are incomplete, so you might run into issues running this example.

### Android

The [`with_winit`](#winit) example supports running on Android, using [cargo apk](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk).

```shell
cargo apk run -p with_winit --lib
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; cargo apk doesn&#039;t support running in release mode without configuration.
&gt; See [their crates page docs](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk) (around `package.metadata.android.signing.&lt;profile&gt;`).
&gt;
&gt; See also [cargo-apk#16](https://github.com/rust-mobile/cargo-apk/issues/16).
&gt; To run in release mode, you must add the following to `examples/with_winit/Cargo.toml` (changing `$HOME` to your home directory):

```toml
[package.metadata.android.signing.release]
path = &quot;$HOME/.android/debug.keystore&quot;
keystore_password = &quot;android&quot;
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; As `cargo apk` does not allow passing command line arguments or environment variables to the app when ran, these can be embedded into the
&gt; program at compile time (currently for Android only)
&gt; `with_winit` currently supports the environment variables:
&gt;
&gt; - `VELLO_STATIC_LOG`, which is equivalent to `RUST_LOG`
&gt; - `VELLO_STATIC_ARGS`, which is equivalent to passing in command line arguments

For example (with unix shell environment variable syntax):

```sh
VELLO_STATIC_LOG=&quot;vello=trace&quot; VELLO_STATIC_ARGS=&quot;--test-scenes&quot; cargo apk run -p with_winit --lib
```

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.86** and later.

Future versions of Vello might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click here if compiling fails.&lt;/summary&gt;

As time has passed, some of Vello&#039;s dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don&#039;t want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency&#039;s name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## History

Vello was previously known as `piet-gpu`.
This prior incarnation used a custom cross-API hardware abstraction layer, called `piet-gpu-hal`, instead of [`wgpu`].

An archive of this version can be found in the branches [`custom-hal-archive-with-shaders`] and [`custom-hal-archive`].
This succeeded the previous prototype, [piet-metal], and included work adapted from [piet-dx12].

The decision to lay down `piet-gpu-hal` in favor of WebGPU is discussed in detail in the blog post [Requiem for piet-gpu-hal].

A [vision](https://github.com/linebender/vello/tree/main/doc/vision.md) document dated December 2020 explained the longer-term goals of the project, and how we might get there.
Many of these items are out-of-date or completed, but it still may provide some useful background.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Get Started

[Install it](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/installation.html) (the package is called &quot;git-delta&quot; in most package managers, but the executable is just `delta`) and add this to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```gitconfig
[core]
    pager = delta

[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only

[delta]
    navigate = true  # use n and N to move between diff sections
    dark = true      # or light = true, or omit for auto-detection

[merge]
    conflictStyle = zdiff3
```

Or run:

```sh
git config --global core.pager delta
git config --global interactive.diffFilter &#039;delta --color-only&#039;
git config --global delta.navigate true
git config --global merge.conflictStyle zdiff3
```

Delta has many features and is very customizable; please see `delta -h` (short help) or `delta --help` (full manual), or the [online user manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/).

## Features

- Language syntax highlighting with the same syntax-highlighting themes as [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#readme)
- Word-level diff highlighting using a Levenshtein edit inference algorithm
- Side-by-side view with line-wrapping
- Line numbering
- `n` and `N` keybindings to move between files in large diffs, and between diffs in `log -p` views (`--navigate`)
- Improved merge conflict display
- Improved `git blame` display (syntax highlighting; `--hyperlinks` formats commits as links to hosting provider etc. Supported hosting providers are: GitHub, GitLab, SourceHut, Codeberg)
- Syntax-highlights grep output from `rg`, `git grep`, `grep`, etc
- Support for Git&#039;s `--color-moved` feature.
- Code can be copied directly from the diff (`-/+` markers are removed by default).
- `diff-highlight` and `diff-so-fancy` emulation modes
- Commit hashes can be formatted as terminal [hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) to the hosting provider page (`--hyperlinks`).
  File paths can also be formatted as hyperlinks for opening in your OS.
- Stylable box/line decorations to draw attention to commit, file and hunk header sections.
- Style strings (foreground color, background color, font attributes) are supported for &gt;20 stylable elements, using the same color/style language as git
- Handles traditional unified diff output in addition to git output
- Automatic detection of light/dark terminal background

## A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output

Code evolves, and we all spend time studying diffs. Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img width=400px src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/86275526-76792100-bba1-11ea-9e78-6be9baa80b29.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;delta with &lt;code&gt;line-numbers&lt;/code&gt; activated&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img width=800px src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/87230973-412eb900-c381-11ea-8aec-cc200290bd1b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;delta with &lt;code&gt;side-by-side&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;line-numbers&lt;/code&gt; activated&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Here&#039;s what `git show` can look like with git configured to use delta:

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img width=500px style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;
           src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/81058545-a5725f80-8e9c-11ea-912e-d21954586a44.png&quot;
           alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img width=500px style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;
           src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/81058911-6abcf700-8e9d-11ea-93be-e212824ec03d.png&quot;
           alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &quot;Dracula&quot; theme
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &quot;GitHub&quot; theme
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

### Syntax-highlighting themes

**All the syntax-highlighting color themes that are available with [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/) are available with delta:**

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img width=400px style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;
           src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/149431273-e3ad049d-771e-4186-869d-0e57967958a6.png&quot;
           alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img width=400px style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;
           src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/149431419-48836001-2afc-4fd0-97ad-561a69b71db7.png&quot;
           alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;delta --show-syntax-themes --dark&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;delta --show-syntax-themes --light&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

### Side-by-side view

[[User manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/side-by-side-view.html)]

```gitconfig
[delta]
    side-by-side = true
```

By default, side-by-side view has line-numbers activated, and has syntax highlighting in both the left and right panels: [[config](#side-by-side-view-1)]

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img width=800px src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/87230973-412eb900-c381-11ea-8aec-cc200290bd1b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Side-by-side view wraps long lines automatically:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img width=600px src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/139064537-f8479504-16d3-429a-b4f6-d0122438adaa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Learn Rust, one exercise at a time

You&#039;ve heard about Rust, but you never had the chance to try it out?\
This course is for you!

You&#039;ll learn Rust by solving 100 exercises.\
You&#039;ll go from knowing nothing about Rust to being able to start
writing your own programs, one exercise at a time.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This course has been written by [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/).\
&gt; It&#039;s one of the trainings in [our portfolio of Rust workshops](https://mainmatter.com/services/workshops/rust/).\
&gt; Check out our [landing page](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/) if you&#039;re looking for Rust consulting or
&gt; training!

## Getting started

Go to [rust-exercises.com](https://rust-exercises.com) and follow the instructions there
to get started with the course.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how
  you installed Rust on your system)
  to make sure you&#039;re running on the latest stable version.
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
  - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
    the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.

## Solutions

You can find the solutions to the exercises in
the [`solutions` branch](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust/tree/solutions) of this repository.

# Solana Program Library

The Solana Program Library (SPL) is a collection of on-chain programs targeting
the [Sealevel parallel
runtime](https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192).
These programs are tested against Solana&#039;s implementation of Sealevel,
solana-runtime, and some are deployed to Mainnet Beta.  As others implement
Sealevel, we will graciously accept patches to ensure the programs here are
portable across all implementations.

For more information see the [SPL documentation](https://spl.solana.com) and the [Token TypeDocs](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/).

## Deployments

Only a subset of programs within the Solana Program Library repo are deployed to

## Development

### Environment Setup

1. Install the latest [Solana tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
2. Install the latest [Rust stable](https://rustup.rs/). If you already have Rust, run `rustup update` to get the latest version.
3. Install the `libudev` development package for your distribution (`libudev-dev` on Debian-derived distros, `libudev-devel` on Redhat-derived).

### Build

### Build on-chain programs

```bash
# To build all on-chain programs
$ cargo build-sbf

# To build a specific on-chain program
$ cd &lt;program_name&gt;/program
$ cargo build-sbf
```

### Build clients

```bash
# To build all clients
$ cargo build

# To build a specific client
$ cd &lt;program_name&gt;/cli
$ cargo build
```

### Test

Unit tests contained within all projects can be run with:
```bash
$ cargo test      # &lt;-- runs host-based tests
$ cargo test-sbf  # &lt;-- runs BPF program tests
```

To run a specific program&#039;s tests, such as SPL Token:
```bash
$ cd token/program
$ cargo test      # &lt;-- runs host-based tests
$ cargo test-sbf  # &lt;-- runs BPF program tests
```

Integration testing may be performed via the per-project .js bindings.  See the
[token program&#039;s js project](token/js) for an example.

### Common Issues

Solutions to a few issues you might run into are mentioned here.

1. `Failed to open: ../../deploy/spl_&lt;program-name&gt;.so`

    Update your Rust and Cargo to the latest versions and re-run `cargo build-sbf` in the relevant `&lt;program-name&gt;` directory,
    or run it at the repository root to rebuild all on-chain programs.

2. [Error while loading shared libraries. (libssl.so.1.1)](https://solana.stackexchange.com/q/3029/36)

    A working solution was mentioned [here](https://solana.stackexchange.com/q/3029/36).
    Install libssl.
    ```bash
    wget http://nz2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.2_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.2_amd64.deb
    ```

3.  CPU or Memory usage at 100%

    This is to be expected while building some of the programs in this library.
    The simplest solution is to add the `--jobs 1` flag to the build commands to limit the number of parallel jobs to 1 and check if that fixes the issue. Although this will mean much longer build times.


### Clippy
```bash
$ cargo clippy
```

### Coverage
```bash
$ ./coverage.sh  # Help wanted! Coverage build currently fails on MacOS due to an XCode `grcov` mismatch...
```

#### MacOS

You may need to pin your grcov version, and then rustup with the apple-darwin nightly toolchain:
```bash
$ cargo install grcov --version 0.6.1
$ rustup toolchain install nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin
```


## Release Process

SPL programs are currently tagged and released manually. Each program is
versioned independently of the others, with all new development occurring on
master. Once a program is tested and deemed ready for release:

### Bump Version

  * Increment the version number in the program&#039;s Cargo.toml
  * Run `cargo build-sbf &lt;program&gt;` to build binary. Note the
    location of the generated `spl_&lt;program&gt;.so` for attaching to the GitHub
    release.
  * Open a PR with these version changes and merge after passing CI.

### Create GitHub tag

Program tags are of the form `&lt;program&gt;-vX.Y.Z`.
Create the new tag at the version-bump commit and push to the
solana-program-library repository, eg:

```
$ git tag token-v1.0.0 b24bfe7
$ git push upstream --tags
```

### Publish GitHub release

  * Go to [GitHub Releases UI](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/releases)
  * Click &quot;Draft new release&quot;, and enter the new tag in the &quot;Tag version&quot; box.
  * Title the release &quot;SPL &lt;Program&gt; vX.Y.Z&quot;, complete the description, and attach the `spl_&lt;program&gt;.so` binary
  * Click &quot;Publish release&quot;

### Publish to Crates.io

Navigate to the program directory and run `cargo package`
to test the build. Then run `cargo publish`.

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: catchphrase --&gt;

## High Performance Matrix Homeserver in Rust!

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: catchphrase --&gt;

&lt;!-- ANCHOR: body --&gt;

Tuwunel is a featureful [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) homeserver you can use instead of Synapse
with your favorite [client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/),
[bridge](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) or
[bot](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/integrations/). It is written entirely in Rust to be a scalable,
lightweight, low-cost, community-driven alternative covering all but the most niche uses.

This project is the official successor to conduwuit, which
was a featureful and high-performance fork of [Conduit](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit), all
community-lead homeservers implementing the compatible
[Matrix Specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/).

Tuwunel is operated by enterprise users with a vested interest in sponsoring its continued
development. It is now maintained by full-time staff.

**1.** [Configure](https://matrix-construct.github.io/tuwunel/configuration.html) by
copying and editing the `tuwunel-example.toml`. The `server_name` and `database_path` must be
configured. **Most users deploy via docker or a distribution package and should follow the
[appropriate guide](https://matrix-construct.github.io/tuwunel/deploying.html) instead.**
This is just a summary for the impatient. See the full
[documentation](https://matrix-construct.github.io/tuwunel/).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Avoid using a sub-domain for your `server_name`. You can always delegate later with a [`.well-known`](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-well-known.md)
&gt; file, but you can never change your `server_name`.

**2.** Setup TLS certificates. Most users enjoy the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse-proxy
which automates their certificate renewal. Advanced users can load their own TLS certificates
using the configuration and Tuwunel can be deployed without a reverse proxy. Example
`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` configuration with [Element](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/releases)
unzipped to `/var/www/element`:
```
tuwunel.me, tuwunel.me:8448 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8008
}
web.tuwunel.me {
    root * /var/www/element/
    file_server
}
```
`caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

**3.** Start the server, connect your client and register your username. The first registration is
granted server admin.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Configure a secret `registration_token` and set `allow_registration = true`

 ü§ó Did you find this and other documentation helpful? We would love to hear feedback about setting
 up Tuwunel.


### Migrating to Tuwunel

| Can I migrate from | |
|-----------------|-----------|
| conduwuit? | ‚úÖ Yes. This will be supported at a minimum for one year, but likely indefinitely. |
| Synapse? | ‚ùå Not yet, but this is planned and an important issue. Subscribe to [#2](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/issues/2). |
| Conduit? | ‚ùå Not right now, but this is planned for the near future. Subscribe to [#41](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/issues/41). |
| Any other fork of Conduit? | ‚ùå No. The migration must be explicitly listed in this table. |
&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; **Never switch between different forks of Conduit or you will corrupt your database.**
&gt; All derivatives of Conduit share the same linear database version without any awareness of other
&gt; forks. The database will permanently corrupt and we will not be able to help you.

#### Migrating from conduwuit

Migrating from conduwuit to Tuwunel _just works_. In technical parlance it is a &quot;binary swap.&quot;
All you have to do is update to the latest Tuwunel and change the path to the executable from
`conduwuit` to `tuwunel`.

Anything else named &quot;conduwuit&quot; is still recognized, this includes environment variables with prefixes
such as `CONDUWUIT_`. In fact, `CONDUIT_` is still recognized for our legacy users. You may have
noticed that various configs, yamls, services, users, and other items were renamed, but if you
were a conduwuit user we recommend against changing anything at all. This will keep things simple.
If you are not sure please ask. If you found out that something did in fact need to be changed
please open an issue immediately.


### Upgrading &amp; Downgrading Tuwunel

We strive to make moving between versions of Tuwunel safe and easy. Downgrading Tuwunel is always
safe but often prevented by a guard. An error will indicate the downgrade is not possible and a
newer version which does not error must be sought.

#### Branches

The main branch is always _reasonably safe_ to run. We understand the propensity for users to simply clone
the main branch to get up and running, and we&#039;re obliged to ensure it&#039;s always viable. Nevertheless, only
tagged releases are true releases.

#### Container Tracking

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **We strongly advise tracking the `:latest` tag when automatically updating.**

Tracking `:latest` gives us the necessary discretion to keep you on the appropriate stable version.
We discourage tracking the main branch unless frequent restarts are acceptable. Alternatively,
tracking the `:preview` tag provides the latest release-candidate becoming equivalent to `:latest`
after a release. Tracking the `:preview` tag is a worthy alternative to the main branch, with
turbulence limited to release-time.

### Getting Help &amp; Support

If you are opposed to using github, or if private discussion is required such as for security
disclosures, or for any other reason, I would be happy to receive your DM at
[@jason:tuwunel.me](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:tuwunel.me). This will not be bothering me as it would
be my pleasure to help you when possible. As an emergency contact you can send an email to
jasonzemos@gmail.com.

##### Tuwunel Fanclub

We have an unofficial community-run chat which is publicly accessible at
[#tuwunel:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#tuwunel:matrix.org). The members, content, or moderation
decisions of this room are not in any way related or endorsed by this project or its sponsors,
and not all project staff will be present there. There will be at least some presence by staff to
offer assistance so long as the room remains in minimally good standing.


## Tuwunel&lt;sup&gt;üíï&lt;/sup&gt;

Tuwunel&#039;s theme is **empathy** in communication defined by the works of
[Edith Stein](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stein/). Empathy is the basis for how we approach
every message and our responsibility to the other in every conversation.

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ ‚Äî the state of your application
* __Messages__ ‚Äî user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ ‚Äî a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ ‚Äî a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let&#039;s say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}
```

Now, let&#039;s show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Column&lt;Message&gt; {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `Increment` message when pressed
            button(&quot;+&quot;).on_press(Message::Increment),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `Decrement` message when pressed
            button(&quot;-&quot;).on_press(Message::Decrement),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&amp;mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::Increment =&gt; {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::Decrement =&gt; {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that&#039;s everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Let&#039;s run it:

```rust
fn main() -&gt; iced::Result {
    iced::run(&quot;A cool counter&quot;, Counter::update, Counter::view)
}
```

Iced will automatically:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

Read the [book], the [documentation], and the [examples] to learn more!

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game library I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping the ecosystem modular.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## Stremio - the next generation media center

Stremio is a full-featured media center designed to help you organize and stream your favorite videos, movies and TV series. It will notify you for new episodes / movies, and allow you to find new content through Discover.

Stremio allows, using its [Add-ons system](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk), to play movies, TV series and channels instantly.

## stremio-core

`stremio-core` is a rust crate that&#039;s designed to contain all the reusable logic between Stremio versions.

### Goals

* Flexibility - can be integrated into existing code bases, across the entire stack, and in different paradigms
	* use case: `types` can be used by add-ons
	* use case: can be used with existing user authentication as an addition to an existing app
	* use case: can use the `Context` model to manage the user authentication/addons, using it as a backbone to the entire Stremio app
* Emphasis on correctness
* No cruft / legacy - not burdened by obsolete decisions &amp; solutions

### Modules

* `types`
* `addon_transport` - handles communication with add-ons, implements legacy protocol adapter
* `state_types`: types that describe application state; inspired by the Elm architecture
	* Effects and Update traits
	* `runtime`: helps using `stremio-core` in an application by handling the effects automatically
	* `environment`: a trait describes the environment (fetch, storage)
	* `msg`: messages: actions, events
	* `models`: all stateful models, such as `Context` (handling user authentication, add-ons), `Library`, `CatalogFiltered`, etc.

## Optimizing WASM output

WASM output binary can get large, especially if we derive Serialize/Deserialize in places we don&#039;t need to

We can optimize it by running twiggy: `twiggy top ..._bg.wasm` and seeing what the biggest code size offenders are


## Adding new actions

Defining actions and what middleware requests they should trigger is defined in `src/state_types/msg/actions`

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains ‚Äî such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations‚Ä¶. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.
