## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

This repository has the source code for Comprehensive Rust ü¶Ä, a multi-day Rust
course developed by the Android team. The course covers all aspects of Rust,
from basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on
[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].

[Android]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/android.html
[Chromium]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/chromium.html
[bare-metal]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html
[concurrency]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html

Read the course at **https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/**.

## Course Format and Target Audience

The course is used internally at Google when teaching Rust to experienced
software engineers. They typically have a background in C++ or Java.

The course is taught in a classroom setting and we hope it will be useful for
others who want to teach Rust to their team. The course will be less useful for
self-study since you miss out on the discussions happening in the classroom. You
don&#039;t see the questions and answers and you don&#039;t see the compiler errors we
trigger when going through the code samples. We hope to improve on this via
[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by
[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).

## Setup

The course is built using a few tools:

- [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)
- [mdbook-svgbob](https://github.com/boozook/mdbook-svgbob)
- [mdbook-i18n-helpers and i18n-report](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers)
- [mdbook-exerciser](mdbook-exerciser/)
- [mdbook-course](mdbook-course/)
- [mdbook-linkcheck2](https://github.com/marxin/mdbook-linkcheck2)

First install Rust by following the instructions on https://rustup.rs/. Then
clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/
cd comprehensive-rust
```

Then install these tools with:

```shell
cargo xtask install-tools
```

&gt; **Note** We use `xtask` for task automation within the project (e.g.
&gt; installing required tools). Xtask is not a package that you should install.
&gt; Visit https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask for more information.

## Commands

Here are some of the commonly used commands you can run in the project. Run
`cargo xtask` to view all available commands.

| Command                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cargo xtask install-tools` | Install all the tools the project depends on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `cargo xtask serve`         | Start a web server with the course. You&#039;ll find the content on http://localhost:3000. To serve any of the translated versions of the course, add the language flag (--language or -l) followed by xx, where xx is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. cargo xtask serve -l da for the Danish translation).                                                                                                                                 |
| `cargo xtask rust-tests`    | Test the included Rust snippets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `cargo xtask web-tests`     | Run the web driver tests in the tests directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `cargo xtask build`         | Create a static version of the course in the `book/` directory. Note that you have to separately build and zip exercises and add them to book/html. To build any of the translated versions of the course, add the language flag (--language or -l) followed by xx, where xx is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. cargo xtask build -l da for the Danish translation). [TRANSLATIONS.md](TRANSLATIONS.md) contains further instructions. |

&gt; **Note** On Windows, you need to enable symlinks
&gt; (`git config --global core.symlinks true`) and Developer Mode.

**Czkawka** (_tch‚Ä¢kav‚Ä¢ka_ (IPA: [Àà ßÃëkafka]), &quot;hiccup&quot; in Polish) is a simple, fast and free app to remove unnecessary
files from your computer.

**Krokiet** ((IPA: [Ààkr…îc…õt]), &quot;croquet&quot; in Polish) same as above, but uses Slint frontend.

## Features

- Written in memory-safe Rust - almost 100% unsafe code free
- Amazingly fast - due to using more or less advanced algorithms and multithreading
- Free, Open Source without ads
- Multiplatform - works on Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD and many more
- Cache support - second and further scans should be much faster than the first one
- CLI frontend - for easy automation
- GUI frontend - uses GTK 4 or Slint frameworks
- No spying - Czkawka does not have access to the Internet, nor does it collect any user information or statistics
- Multilingual - support multiple languages like Polish, English or Italian
- Multiple tools to use:
    - Duplicates - Finds duplicates based on file name, size or hash
    - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of an advanced algorithm
    - Big Files - Finds the provided number of the biggest files in given location
    - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across the drive
    - Temporary Files - Finds temporary files
    - Similar Images - Finds images which are not exactly the same (different resolution, watermarks)
    - Similar Videos - Looks for visually similar videos
    - Same Music - Searches for similar music by tags or by reading content and comparing it
    - Invalid Symbolic Links - Shows symbolic links which point to non-existent files/directories
    - Broken Files - Finds files that are invalid or corrupted
    - Bad Extensions - Lists files whose content not match with their extension

Changelog about each version can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](Changelog.md).

New releases can be found in [Github releases](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases) and nightly builds also in [Nightly releases](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/tag/Nightly)

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it), supports video thumbnails

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

## Thanks

Big thanks to P√°draig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

## Officially Supported Projects
Only this repository, [prebuild-binaries](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases), projects on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/czkawka_gui) and [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.qarmin.czkawka) are directly maintained by me.  

Czkawka does not have an official website, so do not trust any sites that claim to be the official one.  

If you use packages from unofficial sources, make sure they are safe.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Kanidm - Simple and Secure Identity Management

![Kanidm Logo](artwork/logo-small.png)

## About

Kanidm is a simple and secure identity management platform, allowing other applications and services to offload the
challenge of authenticating and storing identities to Kanidm.

The goal of this project is to be a complete identity provider, covering the broadest possible set of requirements and
integrations. You should not need any other components (like Keycloak) when you use Kanidm - we already have everything
you need!

To achieve this we rely heavily on strict defaults, simple configuration, and self-healing components. This allows
Kanidm to support small home labs, families, small businesses, and all the way to the largest enterprise needs.

If you want to host your own authentication service, then Kanidm is for you!

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Supported Features&lt;/summary&gt;

Kanidm supports:

- Passkeys (WebAuthn) for secure cryptographic authentication
  - Attested passkeys for high security environments
- OAuth2/OIDC authentication provider for SSO
- Application Portal allowing easy access to linked applications
- Linux/Unix integration with TPM protected offline authentication
- SSH key distribution to Linux/Unix systems
- RADIUS for network and VPN authentication
- Read-only LDAPs gateway for Legacy Systems
- Complete CLI tooling for Administration
- Two node high availability using database replication
- A WebUI for user self-service

&lt;/details&gt;

## Documentation / Getting Started / Install

## What does Kanidm mean?

Kanidm is a portmanteau of &#039;kani&#039; and &#039;idm&#039;. Kani is Japanese for crab, related to Rust&#039;s mascot Ferris the crab.
Identity management is often abbreviated to &#039;idm&#039;, and is a common industry term for authentication providers.

Kanidm is pronounced as &quot;kar - nee - dee - em&quot;.

## Comparison with other services

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;LLDAP&lt;/summary&gt;

[LLDAP](https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap) is a similar project aiming for a small and easy to administer LDAP server
with a web administration portal. Both projects use the [Kanidm LDAP bindings](https://github.com/kanidm/ldap3), and
have many similar ideas.

The primary benefit of Kanidm over LLDAP is that Kanidm offers a broader set of &quot;built-in&quot; features like OAuth2 and
OIDC. To use these from LLDAP you need an external portal like Keycloak. However, that is also a strength of LLDAP is
that is offers &quot;less&quot; which may make it easier to administer and deploy for you.

While LLDAP offers a simple WebUI as the primary user management frontend, Kanidm currently only offers administration
functionality via its CLI. The Kanidm WebUI is tailored to user interactions.

If Kanidm is too complex for your needs, you should check out LLDAP as a smaller alternative. If you want a project
which has a broader feature set out of the box, then Kanidm will be a better fit.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;389-ds / OpenLDAP&lt;/summary&gt;
Both 389-ds and OpenLDAP are generic LDAP servers. This means they only provide LDAP and you need to
bring your own IDM components - you need your own OIDC portal, a WebUI for self-service, commandline
tools to administer and more.

If you need the highest levels of customisation possible from your LDAP deployment, then these are probably better
alternatives. If you want a service that is easy to set up and focused on IDM, then Kanidm is a better choice.

Kanidm was originally inspired by many elements of both 389-ds and OpenLDAP. Already Kanidm is as fast as (or faster
than) 389-ds for performance and scaling as a directory service while having a richer feature set.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;FreeIPA&lt;/summary&gt;

FreeIPA is another identity management service for Linux/Unix, and ships a huge number of features from LDAP, Kerberos,
DNS, Certificate Authority, and more.

FreeIPA however is a complex system, with a huge amount of parts and configuration. This adds a lot of resource overhead
and difficulty for administration and upgrades.

Kanidm aims to have the features richness of FreeIPA, but without the resource and administration overheads. If you want
a complete IDM package, but in a lighter footprint and easier to manage, then Kanidm is probably for you. In testing
with 3000 users and 1500 groups, Kanidm is 3 times faster for search operations and 5 times faster for modification and
addition of entries (your results may differ however, but generally Kanidm is much faster than FreeIPA).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Keycloak&lt;/summary&gt;

Keycloak is an OIDC/OAuth2/SAML provider. It allows you to layer on WebAuthn to existing IDM systems. Keycloak can
operate as a stand-alone IDM but generally is a component attached to an existing LDAP server or similar.

Keycloak requires a significant amount of configuration and experience to deploy. It allows high levels of customisation
to every detail of its authentication work flows, which makes it harder to start with in many cases.

Kanidm does NOT require Keycloak to provide services such as OAuth2 and integrates many of the elements in a simpler and
correct way out of the box in comparison.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Rauthy&lt;/summary&gt;

Rauthy is a minimal OIDC provider. It supports WebAuthn just like Kanidm - they actually use our libraries for it!

Rauthy only provides support for OIDC and so is unable to support other use cases like RADIUS and unix authentication.

If you need a minimal OIDC only provider, Rauthy is an excellent choice. If you need more features then Kanidm will
support those.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Authentik / Authelia / Zitadel&lt;/summary&gt;

Authentik is an IDM provider written in Python and, Authelia and Zitadel are written in Go. all similar to Kanidm in the
features it offers but notably all have weaker support for UNIX authentication and do not support the same level of
authentication policy as Kanidm. Notably, all are missing WebAuthn Attestation.

All three use an external SQL server such as PostgreSQL. This can create a potential single source of failure and
performance limitation compared to Kanidm which opted to write our own high performance database and replication system
instead based on our experience with enterprise LDAP servers.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Developer Getting Started

If you want to contribute to Kanidm there is a getting started [guide for developers]. IDM is a diverse topic and we
encourage contributions of many kinds in the project, from people of all backgrounds.

When developing the server you should refer to the latest commit documentation instead.

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

Just &quot;uv&quot;, please. See the [style guide](./STYLE.md#styling-uv) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

Zellij includes a built-in [web-client](https://zellij.dev/tutorials/web-client/), making a terminal optional.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÑŸäÿ¨, romanized: zillƒ´j; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew install codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started:

```shell
codex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./.github/codex-cli-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codex CLI login&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](./docs/authentication.md#usage-based-billing-alternative-use-an-openai-api-key). If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the [migration steps](./docs/authentication.md#migrating-from-usage-based-billing-api-key). If you&#039;re having trouble with login, please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1243).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Codex CLI supports [MCP servers](./docs/advanced.md#model-context-protocol-mcp). Enable by adding an `mcp_servers` section to your `~/.codex/config.toml`.


### Configuration

Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in `~/.codex/config.toml`. For full configuration options, see [Configuration](./docs/config.md).

&lt;br /&gt;

SQLx is an async, pure Rust&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä†&lt;/sub&gt; SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

-   **Compile-time checked queries** (if you want). See [SQLx is not an ORM](#sqlx-is-not-an-orm).

-   **Database Agnostic**. Support for [PostgreSQL], [MySQL], [MariaDB], [SQLite].
    -   [MSSQL] was supported prior to version 0.7, but has been removed pending a full rewrite of the driver as part of our [SQLx Pro initiative].

-   **Pure Rust**. The Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB drivers are written in pure Rust using **zero** unsafe&lt;sub&gt;‚Ä†‚Ä†&lt;/sub&gt; code.

-   **Runtime Agnostic**. Works on different runtimes ([`async-std`] / [`tokio`] / [`actix`]) and TLS backends ([`native-tls`], [`rustls`]).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;

‚Ä† The SQLite driver uses the libsqlite3 C library as SQLite is an embedded database (the only way
we could be pure Rust for SQLite is by porting _all_ of SQLite to Rust).

‚Ä†‚Ä† SQLx uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the `sqlite` feature is enabled.
The SQLite driver directly invokes the SQLite3 API via `libsqlite3-sys`, which requires `unsafe`.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS) where supported ([MySQL], [MariaDB] and [PostgreSQL]).

-   Asynchronous notifications using `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for [PostgreSQL].

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

-   `Any` database driver for changing the database driver at runtime. An `AnyPool` connects to the driver indicated by the URL scheme.

## Install

SQLx is compatible with the [`async-std`], [`tokio`], and [`actix`] runtimes; and, the [`native-tls`] and [`rustls`] TLS backends. When adding the dependency, you must choose a runtime feature that is `runtime` + `tls`.

[`async-std`]: https://github.com/async-rs/async-std
[`tokio`]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio
[`actix`]: https://github.com/actix/actix-net
[`native-tls`]: https://crates.io/crates/native-tls
[`rustls`]: https://crates.io/crates/rustls

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# PICK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

# tokio (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot; ] }
# tokio + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }

# async-std (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot; ] }
# async-std + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }
```

#### Cargo Feature Flags

For backward-compatibility reasons, the runtime and TLS features can either be chosen together as a single feature,
or separately.

For forward compatibility, you should use the separate runtime and TLS features as the combination features may
be removed in the future.

-   `runtime-async-std`: Use the `async-std` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-tokio`: Use the `tokio` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

    - Actix-web is fully compatible with Tokio and so a separate runtime feature is no longer needed.

-   `tls-native-tls`: Use the `native-tls` TLS backend (OpenSSL on *nix, SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS).

-   `tls-rustls`: Use the `rustls` TLS backend (cross-platform backend, only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

-   `postgres`: Add support for the Postgres database server.

-   `mysql`: Add support for the MySQL/MariaDB database server.

-   `mssql`: Add support for the MSSQL database server.

-   `sqlite`: Add support for the self-contained [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine with SQLite bundled and statically-linked.

-   `sqlite-unbundled`: The same as above (`sqlite`), but link SQLite from the system instead of the bundled version.
    * Allows updating SQLite independently of SQLx or using forked versions.
    * You must have SQLite installed on the system or provide a path to the library at build time.
       See [the `rusqlite` README](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-building-rusqlite-and-libsqlite3-sys) for details.
    * May result in link errors if the SQLite version is too old. Version `3.20.0` or newer is recommended.
    * Can increase build time due to the use of bindgen.

-   `sqlite-preupdate-hook`: enables SQLite&#039;s [preupdate hook](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/preupdate_count.html) API.
    * Exposed as a separate feature because it&#039;s generally not enabled by default.
    * Using this feature with `sqlite-unbundled` may cause linker failures if the system SQLite version does not support it.

-   `any`: Add support for the `Any` database driver, which can proxy to a database driver at runtime.

-   `derive`: Add support for the derive family macros, those are `FromRow`, `Type`, `Encode`, `Decode`.

-   `macros`: Add support for the `query*!` macros, which allows compile-time checked queries.

-   `migrate`: Add support for the migration management and `migrate!` macro, which allow compile-time embedded migrations.

-   `uuid`: Add support for UUID.

-   `chrono`: Add support for date and time types from `chrono`.

-   `time`: Add support for date and time types from `time` crate (alternative to `chrono`, which is preferred by `query!` macro, if both enabled)

-   `bstr`: Add support for `bstr::BString`.

-   `bigdecimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `bigdecimal` crate.

-   `rust_decimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `rust_decimal` crate.

-   `ipnet`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnet` crate.

-   `ipnetwork`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnetwork` crate.

-   `json`: Add support for `JSON` and `JSONB` (in postgres) using the `serde_json` crate.

-   Offline mode is now always enabled. See [sqlx-cli/README.md][readme-offline].

## SQLx is not an ORM!

SQLx supports **compile-time checked queries**. It does not, however, do this by providing a Rust
API or DSL (domain-specific language) for building queries. Instead, it provides macros that take
regular SQL as input and ensure that it is valid for your database. The way this works is that
SQLx connects to your development DB at compile time to have the database itself verify (and return
some info on) your SQL queries. This has some potentially surprising implications:

- Since SQLx never has to parse the SQL string itself, any syntax that the development DB accepts
  can be used (including things added by database extensions)
- Due to the different amount of information databases let you retrieve about queries, the extent of
  SQL verification you get from the query macros depends on the database

**If you are looking for an (asynchronous) ORM,** you can check out our new [Ecosystem wiki page](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/wiki/Ecosystem#orms)!

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder for more in-depth usage.

### Quickstart

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&quot;postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```


### Connecting

A single connection can be established using any of the database connection types and calling `connect()`.

```rust
use sqlx::Connection;

let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;
```

Generally, you will want to instead create a connection pool (`sqlx::Pool`) for the application to
regulate how many server-side connections it&#039;s using.

```rust
let pool = MySqlPool::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database&quot;).await?;
```

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&amp;str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute(&quot;BEGIN&quot;).await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;)).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row&lt;&#039;conn&gt;` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures_util::TryStreamExt;
// provides `try_get`
use sqlx::Row;

let mut rows = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;)
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &amp;str = row.try_get(&quot;email&quot;)?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, User&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?&quot;)
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.

### Compile-time verification

We can use the macro, `sqlx::query!` to achieve compile-time syntactic and semantic verification of the SQL, with
an output to an anonymous record type where each SQL column is a Rust field (using raw identifiers where needed).

```rust
let countries = sqlx::query!(
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;{ country: String, count: i64 }&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

Differences from `query()`:

-   The input (or bind) parameters must be given all at once (and they are compile-time validated to be
    the right number and the right type).

-   The output type is an anonymous record. In the above example the type would be similar to:

    ```rust
    { country: String, count: i64 }
    ```

-   The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build time to a database which it can prepare
    queries against; the database does not have to contain any data but must be the same
    kind (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) and have the same schema as the database you will be connecting to at runtime.

    For convenience, you can use [a `.env` file][dotenv]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to set DATABASE_URL so that you don&#039;t have to pass it every time:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://localhost/my_database
    ```

[dotenv]: https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv#examples

The biggest downside to `query!()` is that the output type cannot be named (due to Rust not
officially supporting anonymous records). To address that, there is a `query_as!()` macro that is
mostly identical except that you can name the output type.

```rust
// no traits are needed
struct Country { country: String, count: i64 }

let countries = sqlx::query_as!(Country,
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;Country&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

To avoid the need of having a development database around to compile the project even when no
modifications (to the database-accessing parts of the code) are done, you can enable &quot;offline mode&quot;
to cache the results of the SQL query analysis using the `sqlx` command-line tool. See
[sqlx-cli/README.md](./sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query).

Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like
`cargo check` and `cargo build` can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by
putting the following in your `Cargo.toml` (More information in the
[Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) of The Cargo Book)

```toml
[profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
opt-level = 3
```

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `dotenv` crate itself appears abandoned as of [December 2021](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/issues/74)
so we now use the `dotenvy` crate instead. The file format is the same.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% Safe Rust.

If the `sqlite` feature is enabled, this is downgraded to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` on the
`sqlx::sqlite` module. There are several places where we interact with the C SQLite API. We try to document each call for the invariants we&#039;re assuming. We absolutely welcome auditing of, and feedback on, our unsafe code usage.

### FAQ
---

##### What Does Thorium actually do?

Thorium allows for developers or analysts to:
 - Easily scale up and orchestrate docker or baremetal based tools
 - Easily search and use results from tools
 - Comment and share files, tags, and results between users/analysts

##### Are any tools included?

Currently no there are no tools included in Thorium but we plan on releasing some
soon. We hope to continue to release tools as well as allow for curated
contributions from the community.

##### What do I need to deploy Thorium?

Thorium was built and intended to run in a K8s cluster but it can also run on a
laptop using minikube. However it is important to note the single node deployment
was not intended for production and reliability/stability may be less then stellar.
To deploy a single node instance follow the Minithor docs
[here](https://github.com/cisagov/thorium/blob/main/minithor/README.md).

For full production deployment on a cluster you will need the following:
- Block store provider
- S3 storage

For on prem deployments we recommend CEPH. To deploy Thorium on a cluster
follow the docs [here](https://cisagov.github.io/thorium/admins/deploy/deploy.html).

##### How scalable is Thorium?

Thorium is almost infinitely scalable if you have the compute/storage. Thorium has
been tested to support billions of samples and utilization of large amounts of
compute. Thorium partitions data temporally and allows admins to
configure how scalable they want the system to be.

##### Does Thorium call home or send any telemetry out?

No, Thorium does not send any telemetry out.

##### How large of files/repos does Thorium support?

Currently, Thorium supports up to ~50 GiB per file/repo. This is after
compression and so it is a fuzzy limit but it should never be significantly
smaller then 50 GiB. We do have plans to increase this limit in the future
please create an issue if you feel this would be useful.

##### Can you add more documentation and examples of using Thorium and what it can do?

Yes, we plan to continue to expand our documentation and examples soon.

## About

Turso Database is an in-process SQL database written in Rust, compatible with SQLite.

&gt; **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This software is ALPHA, only use for development, testing, and experimentation. We are working to make it production ready, but do not use it for critical data right now.
&gt; 
## Features and Roadmap

* **SQLite compatibility** for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API [see [document](COMPAT.md) for details]
* **Change data capture (CDC)** for real-time tracking of database changes.
* **Language support** for
  * [Go](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go)
  * [JavaScript](bindings/javascript)
  * [Java](bindings/java)
  * [Python](bindings/python)
  * [Rust](bindings/rust)
  * [WebAssembly](bindings/javascript)
* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **Cross-platform** support for Linux, macOS, Windows and browsers (through WebAssembly)
* **Vector support** support including exact search and vector manipulation
* **Improved schema management** including extended `ALTER` support and faster schema changes.

The database has the following experimental features:

* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput using multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
* **Incremental computation** using DBSP for incremental view mainatenance and query subscriptions.

The following features are on our current roadmap:

* **Vector indexing** for fast approximate vector search, similar to [libSQL vector search](https://turso.tech/vector).

## Getting Started

Please see the [Turso Database Manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üíª Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `turso` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/releases/latest/download/turso_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the interactive shell:

```shell
$ tursodb
```

This will start the Turso interactive shell where you can execute SQL statements:

```console
Turso
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
turso&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT, username TEXT);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
turso&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
turso&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```

If you like docker, we got you covered. Simply run this in the root folder:

```bash
make docker-cli-build &amp;&amp; \
make docker-cli-run
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;ü¶Ä Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add turso
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;‚ú® JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i @tursodatabase/database
```

Example usage:

```js
import { connect } from &#039;@tursodatabase/database&#039;;

const db = await connect(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;üêç Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
uv pip install pyturso
```

Example usage:

```python
import turso

con = turso.connect(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
cur = con.cursor()
res = cur.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
print(res.fetchone())
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;ü¶´ Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
go install github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/tursodatabase/turso-go&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;turso&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;‚òïÔ∏è Java&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We integrated Turso Database into JDBC. For detailed instructions on how to use Turso Database with java, please refer to
the [README.md under bindings/java](bindings/java/README.md).
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;ü§ñ MCP Server Mode&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


The Turso CLI includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your databases.

Start the MCP server with:

```shell
tursodb your_database.db --mcp
```

The MCP server provides seven tools for database interaction:

#### Available Tools

1. **`open_database`** - Open a new database
2. **`current_database`** - Describe the current database
3. **`list_tables`** - List all tables in the database
4. **`describe_table`** - Describe the structure of a specific table
5. **`execute_query`** - Execute read-only SELECT queries
6. **`insert_data`** - Insert new data into tables
7. **`update_data`** - Update existing data in tables
8. **`delete_data`** - Delete data from tables
9. **`schema_change`** - Execute schema modification statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

#### Example Usage

The MCP server runs as a single process that handles multiple JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout. Here&#039;s how to interact with it:

#### Example with In-Memory Database

```bash
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;schema_change&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;insert_data&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;Alice&#039;, &#039;alice@example.com&#039;)&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;execute_query&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;}}}
EOF
```

#### Example with Existing Database

```bash
# Working with an existing database file
cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; | tursodb mydb.db --mcp
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;protocolVersion&quot;: &quot;2024-11-05&quot;, &quot;capabilities&quot;: {}, &quot;clientInfo&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;}}}
{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;list_tables&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: {}}}
EOF
```

#### Using with Claude Code

If you&#039;re using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), you can easily connect to your Turso MCP server using the built-in MCP management commands:

##### Quick Setup

1. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the connection

3. **Start querying** your database through natural language!

##### Command Breakdown

```bash
claude mcp add my-database -- tursodb ./path/to/your/database.db --mcp
#              ‚Üë            ‚Üë       ‚Üë                           ‚Üë
#              |            |       |                           |
#              Name         |       Database path               MCP flag
#                          Separator
```

- **`my-database`** - Choose any name for your MCP server
- **`--`** - Required separator between Claude options and your command
- **`tursodb`** - The Turso database CLI
- **`./path/to/your/database.db`** - Path to your SQLite database file
- **`--mcp`** - Enables MCP server mode

##### Example Usage

```bash
# For a local project database
cd /your/project
claude mcp add my-project-db -- tursodb ./data/app.db --mcp

# For an absolute path
claude mcp add analytics-db -- tursodb /Users/you/databases/analytics.db --mcp

# For a specific project (local scope)
claude mcp add project-db --local -- tursodb ./database.db --mcp
```

##### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Get details about a specific server
claude mcp get my-database

# Remove an MCP server
claude mcp remove my-database
```

Once configured, you can ask Claude Code to:
- &quot;Show me all tables in the database&quot;
- &quot;What&#039;s the schema for the users table?&quot;
- &quot;Find all posts with more than 100 upvotes&quot;
- &quot;Insert a new user with name &#039;Alice&#039; and email &#039;alice@example.com&#039;&quot;
&lt;/details&gt;

## Contributing

We&#039;d love to have you contribute to Turso Database! Please check out the [contribution guide] to get started.

### Found a data corruption bug? Get up to $1,000.00

SQLite is loved because it is the most reliable database in the world. The next evolution of SQLite has
to match or surpass this level of reliability. Turso is built with [Deterministic Simulation Testing](simulator/)
from the ground up, and is also tested by [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com).

Even during Alpha, if you find a bug that leads to a data corruption and demonstrate
how our simulator failed to catch it, you can get up to $1,000.00. As the project matures we will
increase the size of the prize, and the scope of the bugs.

More details [here](https://turso.algora.io).

You can see an example of an awarded case on [#2049](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/issues/2049).

Turso core staff are not eligible.


## FAQ

### Is Turso Database ready for production use?

Turso Database is currently under heavy development and is **not** ready for production use.

### How is Turso Database different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Turso Database is a project to build the next evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Turso Database is not - although it is evolving rapidly. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

## ast-grep(sg)

ast-grep(sg) is a CLI tool for code structural search, lint, and rewriting.

## Introduction
ast-grep is an [abstract syntax tree](https://dev.to/balapriya/abstract-syntax-tree-ast-explained-in-plain-english-1h38) based tool to search code by pattern code. Think of it as your old-friend [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep#:~:text=grep%20is%20a%20command%2Dline,which%20has%20the%20same%20effect.), but matching AST nodes instead of text.
You can write patterns as if you are writing ordinary code. It will match all code that has the same syntactical structure.
You can use `$` sign + upper case letters as a [wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character), e.g. `$MATCH`, to match any single AST node. Think of it as [regular expression dot](https://regexone.com/lesson/wildcards_dot) `.`, except it is not textual.

Try the [online playground](https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html) for a taste!

If you find ast-grep interesting and useful for your work, please [buy me a coffee](https://github.com/sponsors/HerringtonDarkholme)
so I can spend more time on the project!

## Feature Highlight

ast-grep&#039;s core is an algorithm to search and replace code based on abstract syntax tree produced by tree-sitter.
It can help you to do lightweight static analysis and massive scale code manipulation in an intuitive way.

Key highlights:

* An intuitive pattern to find and replace AST.
ast-grep&#039;s pattern looks like ordinary code you would write every day (you could say the pattern is isomorphic to code).

* jQuery like API for AST traversal and manipulation.

* YAML configuration to write new linting rules or code modification.

* Written in compiled language, with tree-sitter based parsing and utilizing multiple cores.

* Beautiful command line interface :)

ast-grep&#039;s vision is to democratize abstract syntax tree magic and to liberate one from cumbersome AST programming!

* If you are an open-source library author, ast-grep can help your library users adopt breaking changes more easily.
* if you are a tech lead in your team, ast-grep can help you enforce code best practice tailored to your business need.
* If you are a security researcher, ast-grep can help you write rules much faster.</pre>

# Welcome to Sui

[![Github release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MystenLabs/sui.svg?sort=semver)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/latest)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MystenLabs/sui)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/LICENSE)

[Sui](https://sui.io) is a next-generation smart contract platform with high throughput, low latency, and an asset-oriented programming model powered by the [Move programming language](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move).

## Sui Highlights

Sui offers the following benefits and capabilities:

 * Unmatched scalability, instant settlement
 * A safe smart contract language accessible to mainstream developers
 * Ability to define rich and composable on-chain assets
 * Better user experience for web3 apps

Sui is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost, programmability, and usability. As Sui approaches Mainnet launch, it will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems ‚Äì traditional and blockchain alike. Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># sudo-rs

A safety oriented and memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.

## Status of this project

Sudo-rs is being developed further; features you might expect from original sudo
may still be unimplemented or not planned. If there is an important one you need,
please request it using the issue tracker. If you encounter any usability bugs,
also please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/issues).
Suspected vulnerabilities can be reported on our [security page](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/security).

An [audit of sudo-rs version 0.2.0](docs/audit/audit-report-sudo-rs.pdf) has been performed in August 2023.
The findings from that audit are addressed in the current version.

Sudo-rs currently is targeted for FreeBSD and Linux-based operating systems only.

## Installing sudo-rs

The recommended way to start using `sudo-rs` is via the package manager of your Linux distribution.

### Debian/Ubuntu
If you are running Debian 13 (trixie) or later, or Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) or later, you can use:
```sh
apt-get install sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`. If you want to invoke sudo-rs
via the usual commands `sudo` and `su` instead, prepend `/usr/lib/cargo/bin` to your current `$PATH` variable.

### Fedora

If you are running Fedora 38 or later, you can use:
```sh
dnf install sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux can be installed from the distribution repositories:
```sh
pacman -S sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`.

### Installing our pre-compiled x86-64 binaries

You can also switch to sudo-rs manually by using our pre-compiled tarballs.
We currently only offer these for x86-64 systems.

We recommend installing sudo-rs and su-rs in your `/usr/local` hierarchy so it can co-exist with
your existing sudo installation. You can achieve this using the commands:
```sh
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf sudo-0.2.8.tar.gz
```
and for su-rs:
```sh
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf su-0.2.8.tar.gz
```
This will install sudo-rs and su-rs in `/usr/local/bin` using the usual commands `sudo` and `su`; it
will also install our version of `visudo` in that location.

Of course, if you **don&#039;t** have Todd Miller&#039;s `sudo` installed, you also have to make sure that:

* You manually create a `/etc/sudoers` or `/etc/sudoers-rs` file, this could be as simple as:

      Defaults secure_path=&quot;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin&quot;

      %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

  `sudo-rs` will try to process `/etc/sudoers-rs` if it exists, otherwise it will use `/etc/sudoers`.
  For an explanation of the sudoers syntax you can look at the
  [sudoers man page](https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/sudoers.man/).

* (Strongly recommended) You create `/etc/pam.d/sudo` and `/etc/pam.d/sudo-i` files that contain (for Debian/Ubuntu):

      session required pam_limits.so

      @include common-auth
      @include common-account
      @include common-session-noninteractive

  If you don&#039;t do this, either a &quot;fallback&quot; PAM policy will be used or `sudo-rs` will simply refuse to run
  since it cannot initialize PAM. On Fedora, the syntax for PAM configuration is slightly different, but the
  correct PAM configuration files will most likely be already installed.
  On FreeBSD, you may want to put these files in `/usr/local/etc/pam.d` instead.

### Building from source

Sudo-rs is written in Rust. The minimum required Rust version is 1.70. If your
Linux distribution does not package that version (or a later one), you can always
install the most recent version through [rustup]. You also need the C development
files for PAM (`libpam0g-dev` on Debian, `pam-devel` on Fedora).

On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, use the following command to install the PAM development library:
```
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

On Fedora, CentOS and other Red Hat-based systems, you can use the following command:
```
sudo yum install pam-devel
```

With dependencies installed, building sudo-rs is a simple matter of:
```
cargo build --release
```

This produces a binary `target/release/sudo`. However, this binary must have
the setuid flag set and must be owned by the root user in order to provide any
useful functionality. Consult your operating system manual for details.

Sudo-rs then also needs the configuration files; please follow the installation
suggestions in the previous section.

### Feature flags

#### --features pam-login
By default, sudo-rs will use the PAM service name `sudo`. On Debian and Fedora
systems, it is customary that the name `sudo-i` is used when the `-i / --login`
command line option is used. To get this behaviour, enable the `pam-login`
feature when building:
```
cargo build --release --features pam-login
```
This feature is enabled on our pre-supplied binaries.

#### --features apparmor
sudo-rs has support for selecting AppArmor profile on Linux distributions that
support AppArmor such as Debian and Ubuntu. To enable this feature, build sudo-rs
with apparmor support enabled:
```
cargo build --release --features apparmor
```

This feature is disabled on our pre-supplied binaries.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

## Differences from original sudo

sudo-rs supports less functionality than sudo. Some of this is by design. In
most cases you will get a clear error if you try something that is not
supported (e.g. use a configuration flag or command line option that is not
implemented).

Exceptions to the above, with respect to your `/etc/sudoers` configuration:

* `use_pty` is enabled by default, but can be disabled.
* `env_reset` is ignored --- this is always enabled.
* `visiblepw` is ignored --- this is always disabled.
* `verifypw` is ignored --- this is always set to `all` (the default)
* the (NO)PASSWD tag on the &quot;list&quot; pseudocommand will determine whether a password
  is required for the `sudo -U --list` command, instead of `listpw`.
* `mail_badpass`, `always_set_home`, `always_query_group_plugin` and
  `match_group_by_gid` are not applicable to our implementation, but ignored for
  compatibility reasons.
* `timestamp_type` is always set at `tty`.
* `sudoedit_checkdir` is always `on`, and `sudoedit_follow` is always `off`.

Some other notable restrictions to be aware of:

* Some functionality is not supported, such as preventing shell escapes using `INTERCEPT` and
  storing config in LDAP using `sudoers.ldap`, and `cvtsudoers`.
* Sudo-rs always uses PAM for authentication, so your system must be set up for PAM.
  Sudo-rs will use the `sudo` and `sudo-i` service configuration. This also means
  that resource limits, umasks, etc have to be configured via PAM and not through
  the sudoers file.
* sudo-rs will not include the sendmail support of original sudo.
* The sudoers file must be valid UTF-8.
* To prevent a common configuration mistake in the sudoers file, wildcards
  are not supported in *argument positions* for a command.
  E.g., `%sudoers ALL = /sbin/fsck*` will allow `sudo fsck` and `sudo fsck_exfat` as expected,
  but `%sudoers ALL = /bin/rm *.txt` will not allow an operator to run `sudo rm README.txt`,
  nor `sudo rm -rf /home .txt`, as with original sudo.

If you find a common use case for original sudo missing, please create a feature
request for it in our issue tracker.

## Aim of the project

Our current target is to build a drop-in replacement for all common use cases of
sudo. For the sudoers config syntax this means that we support the default
configuration files of common Linux distributions. Our implementation should support
all commonly used command line options from the original sudo implementation.

Some parts of the original sudo are explicitly not in scope. Sudo has a large
and rich history and some of the features available in the original sudo
implementation are largely unused or only available for legacy platforms. In
order to determine which features make it we both consider whether the feature
is relevant for modern systems, and whether it will receive at very least
decent usage. Finally, of course, a feature should not compromise the safety of
the whole program.

Our `su` implementation is made using the building blocks we created for our
sudo implementation.  It is a suitable replacement for the `su` distributed
by [util-linux].

[util-linux]: https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux

## Future work

While our initial target is a drop-in replacement for most basic use cases of
sudo, our work may evolve beyond that target. We are also looking into
alternative ways to configure sudo without the sudoers config file syntax and to
extract parts of our work in usable crates for other people.

## History

The initial development of sudo-rs was started and funded by the [Internet Security Research Group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/) as part of the [Prossimo project](https://www.memorysafety.org/)

## Acknowledgements

Sudo-rs is an independent implementation, but it incorporates documentation and Rust translations of code from [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/), maintained by Todd C. Miller. We thank Todd and the other sudo contributors for their work.

An independent security audit of sudo-rs was made possible by the [NLNet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/), who also [sponsored](https://nlnet.nl/project/sudo-rs/) work on increased compatibility with the original sudo and the FreeBSD port.

The sudo-rs project would not have existed without the support of its sponsors, a full overview is maintained at https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/privilege-boundary/

            <h2>README</h2><pre># üê∏ rainfrog

a database tool for the terminal

![rainfrog demo](vhs/demo.gif)

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; rainfrog is currently in beta

the goal for rainfrog is to provide a lightweight, terminal-based tool for
interacting with databases.

## features

- efficient navigation via vim-like keybindings and mouse controls
- query editor with keyword highlighting, session history, and favorites
- quickly copy data, filter tables, and switch between schemas
- shortcuts to view table metadata and properties
- cross-platform (macOS, linux, windows, android via termux)

### why &quot;rainfrog&quot;?

&gt; [frogs find refuge in elephant tracks](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190604131157.htm)

### supported databases

the levels of support for different databases can be split into 4 tiers:
- **tier 1**: most frequently tested, bugs will be addressed as soon as possible.
- **tier 2**: often tested, fixed when necessary.
- **tier 3**: community supported; contributions are welcome, but otherwise development is minimal.
- **tier 4**: new or experimental; should be treated as unstable, and behavior is subject to change.


| database | tier | known issues | via wire protocol* |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| postgres | 1 |  | |
| mysql | 2 |  | |
| sqlite | 2  |          | |
| redshift| 2  |          | postgres |
| duckdb | 4 | musl binaries do not include this driver          | |
| oracle | 4 | requires additional runtime dependencies          | |



*the postgres driver can also be used to connect to other databases that support 
the postgres wire protocol, such as AWS Redshift. however, this functionality is not 
well tested. in theory, the mysql driver should be able to do the same for databases 
that support the mysql protocol. check each database&#039;s documentation for compatibility.

## disclaimer

this software is currently under active development; expect breaking changes,
and use at your own risk. it is not recommended to use this tool with write
access on a production database.

[rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):

```sh
cargo install rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;homebrew&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### homebrew
```sh
brew install rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;arch-linux&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### arch linux

arch linux users can install from the
[official repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rainfrog)
using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman):

```sh
pacman -S rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;termux&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### termux

if you are using [termux](https://termux.dev/), you&#039;ll need to install rust via
their package manager:

```sh
pkg install rust
```

and then make sure to install with termux features (and disable default
features):

```sh
cargo install rainfrog --features termux --no-default-features
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;nix&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### nix

```sh
nix-env -iA nixos.rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;conda&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### conda

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;pixi&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### pixi

The command below installs rainfrog from conda-forge, the same repository as conda, but unlike conda it can be installed user-globally using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/).

```sh
pixi global install rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;install-script&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### install script

there is a simple install script that assists in downloading and unpacking a
binary from the release page to `~/.local/bin/`, which you might want to add to
your `PATH` variable if it isn&#039;t already there. you&#039;ll need to select which
binary is appropriate for your system (if you&#039;re not sure, you can find out by
installing rust and running `rustc -vV` to see the &quot;host&quot; target), and the
script also needs [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed to run.

```sh
curl -LSsf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/main/install.sh | bash
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;release-page-binaries&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### release page binaries

1. manually download and unpack the appropriate binary for your os from the
   latest [release](https://github.com/achristmascarl/rainfrog/releases) (if
   you&#039;re not sure which binary to pick, you can find out by installing rust and
   running `rustc -vV` to see the &quot;host&quot; target)
2. move the binary to a folder in your `PATH` environment variable

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;icons&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### icons
you will need to have a nerd font installed and used by your terminal for the icons to show up.

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;dependencies&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## dependencies
for some of the databases supported by rainfrog, the driver has additional runtime dependencies.
you can find instructions for installing those dependencies below.

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;oracle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### oracle
the oracle driver uses ODPI-C, which requires Oracle Client libraries to be installed. instructions
for installing the Oracle Instant Client can be found here: [ODPI-C Installation](https://odpi-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html).

after installation, you may need to manually copy the client files to a
location where ODPI-C can find them, which is either in the same folder as the rainfrog binary,
or in the library path of your os. more details can be found in the ODPI-C
installation instructions: [ODPI-C Client Library Loading](https://odpi-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html#oracle-client-library-loading).

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## usage

```sh
Usage: rainfrog [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -M, --mouse &lt;MOUSE_MODE&gt;   Whether to enable mouse event support. If enabled, the default mouse event handling for your terminal
                             will not work. [possible values: true, false]
  -u, --url &lt;URL&gt;            Full connection URL for the database, e.g. postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
      --username &lt;USERNAME&gt;  Username for database connection
      --password &lt;PASSWORD&gt;  Password for database connection
      --host &lt;HOST&gt;          Host for database connection (ex. localhost)
      --port &lt;PORT&gt;          Port for database connection (ex. 5432)
      --database &lt;DATABASE&gt;  Name of database for connection (ex. postgres)
      --driver &lt;DRIVER&gt;      Driver for database connection (ex. postgres)
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;with-connection-options&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### with connection options

if any options are not provided, you will be prompted to input them.
if you do not provide an input, that option will
default to what is in your environment variables.

```sh
rainfrog \
  --driver &lt;db_driver&gt; \
  --username &lt;username&gt; \
  --host &lt;hostname&gt; \
  --port &lt;db_port&gt; \
  --database &lt;db_name&gt;
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;with-connection-url&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### with connection url

the `connection_url` must include all the necessary options for connecting
to the database (ex. `postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres`).
it will take precedence over all connection options.

```sh
rainfrog --url $(connection_url)
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;with-environment-variables&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### with environment variables
if `connection_url` is not present, rainfrog will first check your `DATABASE_URL`
environment variable, then it will check for `DATABASE_URL` in a `.env` file in
the current directory or a parent directory.

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;docker-run&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### `docker run`

for postgres and mysql, you can run it by specifying all
of the options as environment variables:

```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm --name rainfrog \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e db_driver=&quot;db_driver&quot; \
  -e username=&quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot; \
  -e password=&quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot; \
  -e hostname=&quot;host.docker.internal&quot; \
  -e db_port=&quot;&lt;db_port&gt;&quot; \
  -e db_name=&quot;&lt;db_name&gt;&quot; achristmascarl/rainfrog:latest
```

if you want to provide a custom combination of
options and omit others, you can override the Dockerfile&#039;s
CMD like so:

```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm --name rainfrog \
  achristmascarl/rainfrog:latest \
  rainfrog # overrides CMD, additional options would come after
```

since sqlite is file-based, you may need to mount a path to
the sqlite db as a volume in order to access it:

```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm --name rainfrog \
  -v ~/code/rainfrog/dev/rainfrog.sqlite3:/rainfrog.sqlite3 \
  achristmascarl/rainfrog:latest \
  rainfrog --url sqlite:///rainfrog.sqlite3
```

running drivers which have runtime dependencies (like oracle) via docker
is not currently supported.


&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;customization&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## customization

rainfrog can be customized by placing a `rainfrog_config.toml` file in
one of the following locations depending on your os, as determined by
the [directories](https://crates.io/crates/directories) crate:

| Platform | Value                                                                   | Example                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`_project_path_` or `$HOME`/.config/`_project_path_` | /home/alice/.config/barapp                                    |
| macOS    | `$HOME`/Library/Application Support/`_project_path_`                    | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/com.Foo-Corp.Bar-App |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}`\\`_project_path_`\\config                     | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local\Foo Corp\Bar App\config          |

you can change the default config location by exporting an environment variable.
to make the change permanent, add it to your .zshrc/.bashrc/.\*rc file:

```sh
export RAINFROG_CONFIG=~/.config/rainfrog
```

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### settings

right now, the only setting available is whether rainfrog
captures mouse events by default. capturing mouse events
allows you to change focus and scroll using the mouse.
however, your terminal will not handle mouse events like it
normally does (you won&#039;t be able to copy by highlighting, for example).

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;database-connections&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### database connections

database connections can be configured in the configuration file as shown below:

```
[db]
postgres-local = { host = &quot;localhost&quot;, driver = &quot;postgres&quot;, port = 5432, database = &quot;postgres&quot;, username = &quot;postgres&quot;,  default = true }
postgres-dev = { connection_string = &quot;postgresql://postgres:test123@127.0.0.1:5432&quot;, driver = &quot;postgres&quot; }
mysql-local = { host = &quot;localhost&quot;, driver = &quot;mysql&quot;, port = 32768, database = &quot;rainfrog&quot;, username = &quot;root&quot; }
sqlite-memory = { connection_string = &quot;sqlite://:memory:&quot;, driver = &quot;sqlite&quot;}
sqlite-disk = { connection_string = &quot;sqlite://./my_database.db&quot;, driver = &quot;sqlite&quot;}
oracle-local = { host = &quot;localhost&quot;, driver = &quot;oracle&quot;, port = 1521, database = &quot;rainfrog&quot;, username = &quot;rainfrog&quot; }
```

the connection details can be provided in two formats: a raw connection string or specifying individual fields.
connections input are prioritized in the following order:

- cli input
- `DATABASE_URL` env variable
- config file

if no database connection in the config is set as the default connection, 
a prompt will appear to select the desired database. The user will also be 
prompted for the password for the selected database and will have the option to 
store it in a platform specific keychain for future reuse.
future plans for database connections include switching database without having to restart rainfrog.

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;keybindings&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### keybindings

you can customize some of the default keybindings, but not all of
them. to see a list of the ones you can customize, see the default
config file at [.config/rainfrog_config.toml](./.config/rainfrog_config.toml). below
are the default keybindings.

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;nb-for-mac-users&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
#### n.b. for mac users
on mac, for VS Code, terminal, kitty, and others, a setting for
&quot;use option as meta key&quot; needs to be turned
on for Alt/Opt keybindings to work. (In VS Code, it&#039;s
`&quot;terminal.integrated.macOptionIsMeta&quot;: true` in the settings; in
kitty, it&#039;s `macos_option_as_alt yes` in the config.)

&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;general&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Latest News

* [08/05] Deploy `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with disaggregated serving on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using Dynamo [‚û°Ô∏è link](./components/backends/trtllm/gpt-oss.md)

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs‚Äîand sometimes many servers‚Äîbut it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** ‚Äì Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** ‚Äì Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** ‚Äì Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** ‚Äì Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** ‚Äì Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/support_matrix.md](docs/support_matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:
```
# At the root of the repository:
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, trtllm, and llama.cpp. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** ‚Äì High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** ‚Äì Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** ‚Äì Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.
# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8080 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem]

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --skip-tokenizer-init
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](components/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

### Benchmarking Dynamo

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate and optimize your deployments:

* **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** ‚Äì Compare deployment topologies (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. vanilla vLLM) using GenAI-Perf
* **[Pre-Deployment Profiling](docs/benchmarks/pre_deployment_profiling.md)** ‚Äì Optimize configurations before deployment to meet SLA requirements

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.0.0rc6`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.06`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites
```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
uv pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Required until the trtllm version is bumped to include this pinned dependency itself
uv pip install &quot;cuda-python&gt;=12,&lt;13&quot;

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo
```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```
If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.


## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment
```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install .
# For development, use
export PYTHONPATH=&quot;${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/components/frontend/src:$(pwd)/components/planner/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/vllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/sglang/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/trtllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/llama_cpp/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/mocker/src&quot;
```

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Editable (`-e`) does not work because the `dynamo` package is split over multiple directories, one per backend.

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

&lt;br&gt;

Build for web, desktop, and mobile, and more with a single codebase. Zero-config setup, integrated hot-reloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        h1 { &quot;High-Five counter: {count}&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, &quot;Up high!&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, &quot;Down low!&quot; }
    }
}
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Unique features:

- Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more)
- [Ergonomic state management](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/release-050) combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte
- Built-in featureful, type-safe, fullstack web framework
- Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Subsecond Rust hot-patching and asset hot-reloading
- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup, styles, and see changes in milliseconds. Use our experimental `dx serve --hotpatch` to update Rust code in real time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

## Build Beautiful Apps

Dioxus apps are styled with HTML and CSS. Use the built-in TailwindCSS support or load your favorite CSS library. Easily call into native code (objective-c, JNI, Web-Sys) for a perfect native touch.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/ebou2.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Experimental Native Renderer

Render using web-sys, webview, server-side-rendering, liveview, or even with our experimental WGPU-based renderer. Embed Dioxus in Bevy, WGPU, or even run on embedded Linux!

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/native-blitz-wgpu.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## First-party primitive components

Get started quickly with a complete set of primitives modeled after shadcn/ui and Radix-Primitives.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/primitive-components.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Productive, typesafe, fullstack web framework

Directly call your backend from your frontend with our built-in type-safe RPC using [`server_fn`](http://crates.io/crates/server_fn). Supports streaming, suspense, bundle splitting, websockets, and more.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
  let mut fortune = use_signal(|| &quot;Fetch a fortune!&quot;);
  rsx! {
    h1 { &quot;{fortune}&quot; }
    button {
      onclick: move |_| async move {
        fortune.set(fetch_fortune().await.unwrap());
      }
    }
  }
}

#[server]
async fn fetch_fortune() -&gt; ServerFnResult&lt;String&gt; {
  &quot;Dioxus is super productive!&quot;.to_string()
}
```

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/bundle.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/docs.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Modular and Customizable

Build your own renderer, or use a community renderer like [Freya](http://freyaui.dev). Use our modular components like RSX, VirtualDom, Blitz, Taffy, and Subsecond.

Dioxus is a community-driven project, with a very active [Discord](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM) and [GitHub](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues) community. We&#039;re always looking for help, and we&#039;re happy to answer questions and help you get started. [Our SDK](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus-std) is community-run and we even have a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/dioxus-community/) for the best Dioxus crates that receive free upgrades and support.

## Full-time core team

Dioxus has grown from a side project to a small team of fulltime engineers. Thanks to the generous support of FutureWei, Satellite.im, the GitHub Accelerator program, we&#039;re able to work on Dioxus full-time. Our long term goal is for Dioxus to become self-sustaining by providing paid high-quality enterprise tools. If your company is interested in adopting Dioxus and would like to work with us, please reach out!

## Running the examples

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli to test out features like hot-reloading. To install the most recent binary CLI, you can use cargo binstall.

```sh
cargo binstall dioxus-cli@0.7.0-rc.0 --force
```

If this CLI is out-of-date, you can install it directly from git

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You will need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```
