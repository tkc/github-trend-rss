![Pingora banner image](./docs/assets/pingora_banner.png)

## What is Pingora
Pingora is a Rust framework to [build fast, reliable and programmable networked systems](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source).

Pingora is battle tested as it has been serving more than 40 million Internet requests per second for [more than a few years](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet).

## Feature highlights
* Async Rust: fast and reliable
* HTTP 1/2 end to end proxy
* TLS over OpenSSL, BoringSSL, s2n-tls, or rustls(experimental).
* gRPC and websocket proxying
* Graceful reload
* Customizable load balancing and failover strategies
* Support for a variety of observability tools

## Reasons to use Pingora
* **Security** is your top priority: Pingora is a more memory safe alternative for services that are written in C/C++
* Your service is **performance-sensitive**: Pingora is fast and efficient
* Your service requires extensive **customization**: The APIs Pingora proxy framework provides are highly programmable

# Getting started

See our [quick starting guide](./docs/quick_start.md) to see how easy it is to build a load balancer.

Our [user guide](./docs/user_guide/index.md) covers more topics such as how to configure and run Pingora servers, as well as how to build custom HTTP servers and proxy logic on top of Pingora&#039;s framework.

API docs are also available for all the crates.

# Notable crates in this workspace
* Pingora: the &quot;public facing&quot; crate to build networked systems and proxies
* Pingora-core: this crate defines the protocols, functionalities and basic traits
* Pingora-proxy: the logic and APIs to build HTTP proxies
* Pingora-error: the common error type used across Pingora crates
* Pingora-http: the HTTP header definitions and APIs
* Pingora-openssl &amp; pingora-boringssl: SSL related extensions and APIs
* Pingora-ketama: the [Ketama](https://github.com/RJ/ketama) consistent algorithm
* Pingora-limits: efficient counting algorithms
* Pingora-load-balancing: load balancing algorithm extensions for pingora-proxy
* Pingora-memory-cache: Async in-memory caching with cache lock to prevent cache stampede
* Pingora-s2n: SSL extensions and APIs related to s2n-tls
* Pingora-timeout: A more efficient async timer system
* TinyUfo: The caching algorithm behind pingora-memory-cache

Note that Pingora proxy integration with caching should be considered experimental, and as such APIs related to caching are currently highly volatile.

# System requirements

## Systems
Linux is our tier 1 environment and main focus.

We will try our best for most code to compile for Unix environments. This is for developers and users to have an easier time developing with Pingora in Unix-like environments like macOS (though some features might be missing)

Windows support is preliminary by community&#039;s best effort only.

Both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures will be supported.

## Rust version

Pingora keeps a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) policy of 6 months. This means we will accept PRs that upgrade the MSRV as long as the new Rust version used is at least 6 months old.

Our current MSRV is effectively 1.83.

Previously Pingora advertised an MSRV of 1.72. Older Rust versions may still be able to compile via `cargo update` pinning dependencies such as `backtrace@0.3.74`. The advertised MSRV in config files will be officially bumped to 1.83 in an upcoming release.

## Build Requirements

Some of the crates in this repository have dependencies on additional tools and
libraries that must be satisfied in order to build them:

* Make sure that [Clang] is installed on your system (for boringssl)
* Make sure that [Perl 5] is installed on your system (for openssl)

[Clang]:https://clang.llvm.org/
[Perl 5]:https://www.perl.org/

Congratulations to the Asterinas community🎉🎉🎉

## Introducing Asterinas

Asterinas is a _secure_, _fast_, and _general-purpose_ OS kernel
that provides _Linux-compatible_ ABI.
It can serve as a seamless replacement for Linux
while enhancing _memory safety_ and _developer friendliness_.

* Asterinas prioritizes memory safety
by employing Rust as its sole programming language
and limiting the use of _unsafe Rust_
to a clearly defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This innovative approach,
known as [the framekernel architecture](https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.html),
establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option.

* Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness.
It empowers kernel developers to
(1) utilize the more productive Rust programming language,
(2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called [OSDK](https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/index.html) to streamline their workflows,
and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as open source
or keeping them proprietary,
thanks to the flexibility offered by [MPL](#License).

While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel is challenging,
we are steadfastly progressing towards this goal.
Over the course of 2024,
we significantly enhanced Asterinas&#039;s maturity,
as detailed in [our end-year report](https://asterinas.github.io/2025/01/20/asterinas-in-2024.html).
In 2025, our primary goal is to make Asterinas production-ready on x86-64 virtual machines
and attract real users!

## Getting Started

Get yourself an x86-64 Linux machine with Docker installed.
Follow the three simple steps below to get Asterinas up and running.

1. Download the latest source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas
```

2. Run a Docker container as the development environment.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --network=host --device=/dev/kvm -v $(pwd)/asterinas:/root/asterinas asterinas/asterinas:0.16.1-20250922
```

3. Inside the container, go to the project folder to build and run Asterinas.

```bash
make build
make run
```

If everything goes well, Asterinas is now up and running inside a VM.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Pyrefly: A fast type checker and language server for Python with powerful IDE features

[![pyrefly](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://pyrefly.org/badge.json)](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyrefly.svg?color=blue)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrefly)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/Cf7mFQtW7W)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Pyrefly is a type checker and language server for Python, which provides
lightning-fast type checking along with IDE features such as code navigation,
semantic highlighting, and code completion. It is available as a
[command-line tool](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/installation/) and a
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly).

See the [Pyrefly website](https://pyrefly.org) for full documentation and how to
add Pyrefly to your editor of choice.

Currently under active development with known issues. Please open an issue if
you find bugs.

### Getting Started

- Try out pyrefly in your browser: [Sandbox](https://pyrefly.org/sandbox/)
- Get the command-line tool: `pip install pyrefly`
- Get the VSCode extension:
  [Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.pyrefly)

### Key Features:

- Type Inference: Pyrefly infers types in most locations, apart from function
  parameters. It can infer types of variables and return types.
- Flow Types: Pyrefly can understand your program&#039;s control flow to refine
  static types.
- Incrementality: Pyrefly aims for large-scale incrementality at the module
  level, with optimized checking and parallelism.

## Getting Involved

If you have questions or would like to report a bug, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).

See our
[contributing guide](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for information on how to contribute to Pyrefly.

Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Cf7mFQtW7W) to chat about Pyrefly
and types. This is also where we hold biweekly office hours.

## Choices

There are a number of choices when writing a Python type checker. We are taking
inspiration from [Pyre1](https://pyre-check.org/),
[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) and
[MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Some notable choices:

- We infer types in most locations, apart from parameters to functions. We do
  infer types of variables and return types. As an example,
  `def foo(x): return True` would result in something equivalent to had you
  written `def foo(x: Any) -&gt; bool: ...`.
- We attempt to infer the type of `[]` to however it is used first, then fix it
  after. For example `xs = []; xs.append(1); xs.append(&quot;&quot;)` will infer that
  `xs: List[int]` and then error on the final statement.
- We use flow types which refine static types, e.g. `x: int = 4` will both know
  that `x` has type `int`, but also that the immediately next usage of `x` will
  be aware the type is `Literal[4]`.
- We aim for large-scale incrementality (at the module level) and optimized
  checking with parallelism, aiming to use the advantages of Rust to keep the
  code a bit simpler.
- We expect large strongly connected components of modules, and do not attempt
  to take advantage of a DAG-shape in the source code.

## Code layout

Pyrefly is split into a number of crates (mostly under `crates/`):

- `pyrefly_util` are general purpose utilities, which have nothing to do with
  Python or type checking. Examples include IO wrappers, locking, command line
  helpers etc.
- `pyrefly_derive` are proc-macros for deriving traits such as `TypeEq` and
  `Visit`.
- `pyrefly_python` are Python utilities with no type-checking aspects, such as
  modelling modules or `sys.info`.
- `pyrefly_bundled` are the third-party
  [typeshed stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
- `pyrefly_config` defines the Pyrefly configuration, along with support for
  reading Mypy/Pyright configuration.
- `pyrefly_types` defines the Pyrefly type along with operations on it.
- `pyrefly_wasm` defines the sandbox code that compiles to WASM.
- `pyrefly` itself is the type checker and everything else.

## Design

There are many nuances of design that change on a regular basis. But the basic
substrate on which the checker is built involves three steps:

1. Figure out what each module exports. That requires solving all `import *`
   statements transitively.
2. For each module in isolation, convert it to bindings, dealing with all
   statements and scope information (both static and flow).
3. Solve those bindings, which may require the solutions of bindings in other
   modules.

If we encounter unknowable information (e.g. recursion) we use `Type::Var` to
insert placeholders which are filled in later.

For each module, we solve the steps sequentially and completely. In particular,
we do not try and solve a specific identifier first (like
[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)), and do not use fine-grained
incrementality (like [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
using [Salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa)). Instead, we aim for raw
performance and a simpler module-centric design - there&#039;s no need to solve a
single binding in isolation if solving all bindings in a module is fast enough.

### Example of bindings

Given the program:

```python
1: x: int = 4
2: print(x)
```

We might produce the bindings:

- `define int@0` = `from builtins import int`
- `define x@1` = `4: int@0`
- `use x@2` = `x@1`
- `anon @2` = `print(x@2)`
- `export x` = `x@2`

Of note:

- The keys are things like `define` (the definition of something), `use` (a
  usage of a thing) and `anon` (a statement we need to type check, but don&#039;t
  care about the result of).
- In many cases the value of a key refers to other keys.
- Some keys are imported from other modules, via `export` keys and `import`
  values.
- In order to disambiguate identifiers we use the textual position at which they
  occur (in the example we&#039;ve used `@line`, but in reality it&#039;s the byte offset
  in the file).

### Example of `Var`

Given the program:

```python
1: x = 1
2: while test():
3:     x = x
4: print(x)
```

We end up with the bindings:

- `x@1` = `1`
- `x@3` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`
- `x@4` = `phi(x@1, x@3)`

The expression `phi` is the join point of the two values, e.g. `phi(int, str)`
would be `int | str`. We skip the distinction between `define` and `use`, since
it is not necessary for this example.

When solving `x@3` we encounter recursion. Operationally:

- We start solving `x@3`.
- That requires us to solve `x@1`.
- We solve `x@1` to be `Literal[1]`
- We start solving `x@3`. But we are currently solving `x@3`, so we invent a
  fresh `Var` (let&#039;s call it `?1`) and return that.
- We conclude that `x@3` must be `Literal[1] | ?1`.
- Since `?1` was introduced by `x@3` we record that `?1 = Literal[1] | ?1`. We
  can take the upper reachable bound of that and conclude that
  `?1 = Literal[1]`.
- We simplify `x@3` to just `Literal[1]`.

  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/releases/tag/v0.7.0&quot;&gt;✨ Dioxus 0.7 is out!!! ✨&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Build for web, desktop, and mobile, and more with a single codebase. Zero-config setup, integrated hot-reloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        h1 { &quot;High-Five counter: {count}&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, &quot;Up high!&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, &quot;Down low!&quot; }
    }
}
```

## ⭐️ Unique features:

- Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more)
- [Ergonomic state management](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/release-050) combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte
- Built-in featureful, type-safe, fullstack web framework
- Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Subsecond Rust hot-patching and asset hot-reloading
- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup, styles, and see changes in milliseconds. Use our experimental `dx serve --hotpatch` to update Rust code in real time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;!-- &lt;video src=&quot;https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/10237910/386919031-6da371d5-3340-46da-84ff-628216851ba6.mov&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;video src=&quot;https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/10237910/386919031-6da371d5-3340-46da-84ff-628216851ba6.mov&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Build Beautiful Apps

Dioxus apps are styled with HTML and CSS. Use the built-in TailwindCSS support or load your favorite CSS library. Easily call into native code (objective-c, JNI, Web-Sys) for a perfect native touch.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/ebou2.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



## Truly fullstack applications

Dioxus deeply integrates with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) to provide powerful fullstack capabilities for both clients and servers. Pick from a wide array of built-in batteries like WebSockets, SSE, Streaming, File Upload/Download, Server-Side-Rendering, Forms, Middleware, and Hot-Reload, or go fully custom and integrate your existing axum backend.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/fullstack-websockets.avif&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Experimental Native Renderer

Render using web-sys, webview, server-side-rendering, liveview, or even with our experimental WGPU-based renderer. Embed Dioxus in Bevy, WGPU, or even run on embedded Linux!

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/native-blitz-wgpu.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## First-party primitive components

Get started quickly with a complete set of primitives modeled after shadcn/ui and Radix-Primitives.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/primitive-components.avif&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/tutorial/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/bundle.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/docs.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Modular and Customizable

Build your own renderer, or use a community renderer like [Freya](http://freyaui.dev). Use our modular components like RSX, VirtualDom, Blitz, Taffy, and Subsecond.


&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/freya-todo-example.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Community

Dioxus is a community-driven project, with a very active [Discord](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM) and [GitHub](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues) community. We&#039;re always looking for help, and we&#039;re happy to answer questions and help you get started. [Our SDK](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus-std) is community-run and we even have a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/dioxus-community/) for the best Dioxus crates that receive free upgrades and support.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/dioxus-community.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Full-time core team

Dioxus has grown from a side project to a small team of fulltime engineers. Thanks to the generous support of FutureWei, Satellite.im, the GitHub Accelerator program, we&#039;re able to work on Dioxus full-time. Our long term goal is for Dioxus to become self-sustaining by providing paid high-quality enterprise tools. If your company is interested in adopting Dioxus and would like to work with us, please reach out!

  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Running the examples

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli to test out features like hot-reloading. To install the most recent binary CLI, you can use cargo binstall.

```sh
cargo binstall dioxus-cli@0.7.0 --force
```

If this CLI is out-of-date, you can install it directly from git

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You will need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

&lt;/p&gt;

- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.14 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors) for [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23431#issuecomment-1302557034), lead developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) (also [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028)):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.14.3
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs—and sometimes many servers—but it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/reference/support-matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Python development headers

Backend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:

```
# At the root of the repository:
# Edit deploy/docker-compose.yml to comment out &quot;runtime: nvidia&quot; of the dcgm-exporter service if the nvidia container runtime isn&#039;t deployed or to be used.
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Sanity check (optional)

Before trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:

```bash
./deploy/sanity_check.py
```

This is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.
# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem]

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/kubernetes/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](examples/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

### Benchmarking Dynamo

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate and optimize your deployments:

- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. vanilla vLLM) using AIPerf
- **[SLA-Driven Dynamo Deployments](docs/planner/sla_planner_quickstart.md)** – Optimize your deployment to meet SLA requirements

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.sglang --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.1.0rc5`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.06`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites

```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
uv pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Required until the trtllm version is bumped to include this pinned dependency itself
uv pip install &quot;cuda-python&gt;=12,&lt;13&quot;

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:

```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```

If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.

## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

## Getting Started

### Play with our Examples

Go to &lt;https://wgpu.rs/examples/&gt; to play with our examples in your browser. Requires a browser supporting WebGPU for the WebGPU examples.

### Rust

Rust examples can be found at [examples](examples). You can run the examples natively with `cargo run --bin wgpu-examples &lt;example&gt;`.

If you are new to wgpu and graphics programming, we recommend starting with https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/.

To run the examples in a browser, run `cargo xtask run-wasm`.
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and you can choose an example to run.
Naturally, in order to display any of the WebGPU based examples, you need to make sure your browser supports it.

### C/C++

To use wgpu in C/C++, you need [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native).

If you are looking for a wgpu C++ tutorial, look at the following:

- https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/

### Others

If you want to use wgpu in other languages, there are many bindings to wgpu-native from languages such as Python, D, Julia, Kotlin, and more. See [the list](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native#bindings).

## Wiki

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki) that serves as a knowledge base.

## Extension Specifications

While the core of wgpu is based on the WebGPU standard, we also support extensions that allow for features that the standard does not have yet.
For high-level documentation on how to use these extensions, see the individual specifications:

🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 APIs are subject to change and may allow undefined behavior if used incorrectly.

- 🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 [Ray Tracing](./docs/api-specs/ray_tracing.md).
- 🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 [Mesh Shading](./docs/api-specs/mesh_shading.md).

### Shader Support

wgpu supports shaders in [WGSL](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/), SPIR-V, and GLSL.
Both [HLSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) and [GLSL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)
have compilers to target SPIR-V. All of these shader languages can be used with any backend as we handle all of the conversions. Additionally, support for these shader inputs is not going away.

While WebGPU does not support any shading language other than WGSL, we will automatically convert your
non-WGSL shaders if you&#039;re running on WebGPU.

WGSL is always supported by default, but GLSL and SPIR-V need features enabled to compile in support.

Note that the WGSL specification is still under development,
so the [draft specification][wgsl spec] does not exactly describe what `wgpu` supports.
See [below](#tracking-the-webgpu-and-wgsl-draft-specifications) for details.

To enable SPIR-V shaders, enable the `spirv` feature of wgpu.
To enable GLSL shaders, enable the `glsl` feature of wgpu.

### Angle

[Angle](http://angleproject.org) is a translation layer from GLES to other backends developed by Google.
We support running our GLES3 backend over it in order to reach platforms DX11 support, which aren&#039;t accessible otherwise.
In order to run with Angle, the &quot;angle&quot; feature has to be enabled, and Angle libraries placed in a location visible to the application.
These binaries can be downloaded from [gfbuild-angle](https://github.com/DileSoft/gfbuild-angle) artifacts, [manual compilation](https://github.com/google/angle/blob/main/doc/DevSetup.md) may be required on Macs with Apple silicon.

On Windows, you generally need to copy them into the working directory, in the same directory as the executable, or somewhere in your path.
On Linux, you can point to them using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment.

### MSRV policy

Due to complex dependants, we have two MSRV policies:

- `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types`&#039;s MSRV is **1.82**.
- The rest of the workspace has an MSRV of **1.88**.

It is enforced on CI (in &quot;/.github/workflows/ci.yml&quot;) with the `CORE_MSRV` and `REPO_MSRV` variables.
This version can only be upgraded in breaking releases, though we release a breaking version every three months.

The `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types` crates should never
require an MSRV ahead of Firefox&#039;s MSRV for nightly builds, as
determined by the value of `MINIMUM_RUST_VERSION` in
[`python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py`][util].

[util]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py

## Environment Variables

All testing and example infrastructure share the same set of environment variables that determine which Backend/GPU it will run on.

- `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` with a substring of the name of the adapter you want to use (ex. `1080` will match `NVIDIA GeForce 1080ti`).
- `WGPU_BACKEND` with a comma-separated list of the backends you want to use (`vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12`, or `gl`).
- `WGPU_POWER_PREF` with the power preference to choose when a specific adapter name isn&#039;t specified (`high`, `low` or `none`)
- `WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` with the DX12 shader compiler you wish to use (`dxc`, `static-dxc`, or `fxc`). Note that `dxc` requires `dxcompiler.dll` (min v1.8.2502) to be in the working directory, and `static-dxc` requires the `static-dxc` crate feature to be enabled. Otherwise, it will fall back to `fxc`.
- `WGPU_GLES_MINOR_VERSION` with the minor OpenGL ES 3 version number to request (`0`, `1`, `2` or `automatic`).
- `WGPU_ALLOW_UNDERLYING_NONCOMPLIANT_ADAPTER` with a boolean whether non-compliant drivers are enumerated (`0` for false, `1` for true).

When running the CTS, use the variables `DENO_WEBGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`, `DENO_WEBGPU_BACKEND`, `DENO_WEBGPU_POWER_PREFERENCE`.

## Testing

We have multiple methods of testing, each of which tests different qualities about wgpu. We automatically run our tests on CI. The current state of CI testing:

| Platform/Backend | Tests              | Notes                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Windows/DX12     | :heavy_check_mark: | using WARP            |
| Windows/OpenGL   | :heavy_check_mark: | using llvmpipe        |
| MacOS/Metal      | :heavy_check_mark: | using hardware runner |
| Linux/Vulkan     | :heavy_check_mark: | using lavapipe        |
| Linux/OpenGL ES  | :heavy_check_mark: | using llvmpipe        |
| Chrome/WebGL     | :heavy_check_mark: | using swiftshader     |
| Chrome/WebGPU    | :x:                | not set up            |

### Core Test Infrastructure

We use a tool called [`cargo nextest`](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest) to run our tests.
To install it, run `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

To run the test suite:

```
cargo xtask test
```

To run the test suite on WebGL (currently incomplete):

```
cd wgpu
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome --no-default-features --features webgl --workspace
```

This will automatically run the tests using a packaged browser. Remove `--headless` to run the tests with whatever browser you wish at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you are a user and want a way to help contribute to wgpu, we always need more help writing test cases.

### WebGPU Conformance Test Suite

WebGPU includes a Conformance Test Suite to validate that implementations are
working correctly. We run cases from the CTS against wgpu using
[Deno](https://deno.com/). A [default list of enabled
tests](./cts_runner/test.lst) is automatically run on pull requests in CI.

To run the default set of CTS tests locally, run:

```
cargo xtask cts
```

You can also specify a test selector on the command line:

```
cargo xtask cts &#039;webgpu:api,operation,command_buffer,basic:*&#039;
```

Or supply your own test list in a file:

```
cargo xtask cts -f your_tests.lst
```

To find the full list of tests, go to the
[web version of the CTS](https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/standalone/?runnow=0&amp;worker=0&amp;debug=0&amp;q=webgpu:*).

The version of the CTS used by `cargo xtask cts` is specified in
[`cts_runner/revision.txt`](./cts_runner/revision.txt).

## Tracking the WebGPU and WGSL draft specifications

The `wgpu` crate is meant to be an idiomatic Rust translation of the [WebGPU API][webgpu spec].
That specification, along with its shading language, [WGSL][wgsl spec],
are both still in the &quot;Working Draft&quot; phase,
and while the general outlines are stable,
details change frequently.
Until the specification is stabilized, the `wgpu` crate and the version of WGSL it implements
will likely differ from what is specified,
as the implementation catches up.

Exactly which WGSL features `wgpu` supports depends on how you are using it:

- When running as native code, `wgpu` uses [Naga][naga]
  to translate WGSL code into the shading language of your platform&#039;s native GPU API.
  Naga is working on catching up to the WGSL specification,
  with [bugs][naga bugs] tracking various issues,
  but there is no concise summary of differences from the specification.

- When running in a web browser (by compilation to WebAssembly)
  without the `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` relies on the browser&#039;s own WebGPU implementation.
  WGSL shaders are simply passed through to the browser,
  so that determines which WGSL features you can use.

- When running in a web browser with `wgpu`&#039;s `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` uses Naga to translate WGSL programs into GLSL.
  This uses the same version of Naga as if you were running `wgpu` as native code.

## Coordinate Systems

wgpu uses the coordinate systems of D3D and Metal:

Keys are mapped according to [these defaults](https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Setup). Xbox-style controllers also have a [default mapping applied](https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64/wiki/Default-Gamepad-Setup).

## netplay

Gopher64 supports netplay (online play with others) via cloud hosted servers. You can also run the server (https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64-netplay-server) yourself on a LAN.

## portable mode

If you would like to keep all the game data in the same folder as the executable, you just need to create a file called &quot;portable.txt&quot; in the same directory as the executable.

## flatpak

If you want to run the flatpak from the command line, you need to add the `--filesystem=host:ro` option, for example:

```
flatpak run --filesystem=host:ro io.github.gopher64.gopher64 /path/to/rom.z64
```

# Installation

- Arch Linux: Install the package from official repositories: `pacman -S lact`
  (or `lact-git` from AUR for development builds).
- Debian/Ubuntu/Derivatives: Download a .deb from
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  It is only available on Debian 12+ and Ubuntu 22.04+ as older versions don&#039;t
  ship gtk4.
- Fedora: use the
  [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ilyaz/LACT/), or
  download an RPM from
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).
- Bazzite: Use the Flatpak below.

  This helper installs the Flatpak version and automatically adds the AMD
  overclocking boot option.
- Gentoo: Available in
  [GURU](https://github.com/gentoo/guru/tree/master/sys-apps/lact).
- OpenSUSE: an RPM is available in
  [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  Only tumbleweed is supported as leap does not have the required dependencies
  in the repos.
- NixOS: There is a package available in
  [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=24.05&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=lact)
- Flatpak (universal): Available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.ilya_zlobintsev.LACT) and in [releases](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/).

  See the [Flatpak documentation](./flatpak/README.md) for setup notes.
- Build from source.

Note: Nvidia support requires the Nvidia proprietary driver with CUDA libraries
installed.

## Development builds

To get latest fixes or features that have not yet been released in a stable
version, there are packages built from the latest commit that you can install
from the
[test release](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/test-build)
or using the `lact-git` AUR package on Arch-based distros.

Note: the date that GitHub shows next to the test release is not when the packages were built,
the actual date is specified next to the attached package files.

# Usage

Enable and start the service (otherwise you won&#039;t be able to change any
settings):

```
sudo systemctl enable --now lactd
```

You can now use the GUI to change settings and view information.

# Hardware support

See the
[Wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Hardware-Support)

# Configuration

There is a configuration file available in `/etc/lact/config.yaml`. Most of the
settings are accessible through the GUI, but some of them may be useful to be
edited manually (like `admin_group` and `admin_user` to specify who has access
to the daemon)

See [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information.

**Socket permissions setup:**

By default, LACT uses either ether the `wheel` or `sudo` group (whichever is
available) for the ownership of the unix socket that the GUI needs to connect
to.

On most desktop configurations (such as the default setup on Arch-based, most
Debian-based or Fedora systems) this includes the default user, so you do not
need to configure this.

However, some systems may have different user configuration. In particular, this
has been reported to be a problem on OpenSUSE.

To fix socket permissions in such configurations, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml`
and under the `daemon` section either:

- Set `admin_user` to your username
- Set `admin_group` to a group that your user is a part of Then restart the
  service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

# Overclocking (AMD)

Some functionality requires enabling an option in the amdgpu driver, see the
[wiki page](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/wiki/Overclocking-(AMD)) for
more information.

## Power profiles daemon note!

If you are using `power-profiles-daemon` (which is installed by default on many
distributions), by default it may override the amdgpu performance level setting
according to its own profile.

When using LACT 0.7.5+ and power-profiles-daemon 0.30+, LACT will try to connect to power-profiles-daemon 
and automatically disable the conflicting amdgpu action in ppd to avoid this conflict.

If running older versions, you can resolve this manually by creating a file at
`/etc/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service.d/override.conf` with the
following contents:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/power-profiles-daemon --block-action=amdgpu_dpm
```

Note: the `/usr/libexec` path might be different on your system, check it in
`systemctl status power-profiles-daemon`

See https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/issues/370 for more information.

# Suspend/Resume

As some of the GPU settings may get reset when suspending the system, LACT will
reload them on system resume. This may not work on distributions which don&#039;t use
systemd, as it relies on the `org.freedesktop.login2` DBus interface.

# Building from source

Dependencies:

- rust 1.76+
- gtk 4.6+
- git
- pkg-config
- clang
- make
- hwdata
- libdrm
- vulkan-tools
- ocl-icd

Command to install all dependencies:

- Fedora:
  `sudo dnf install rust cargo make git clang gtk4-devel libdrm-devel vulkan-tools OpenCL-ICD-Loader-devel`
- Arch:
  `sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git clang make rust gtk4 hwdata vulkan-tools ocl-icd`

Steps:

- `git clone https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT &amp;&amp; cd LACT`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`

It&#039;s possible to change which features LACT gets built with. To do so, replace
the `make` command with the following variation:

Headless build with no GUI:

```
make build-release-headless
```

Build GUI with libadwaita support:

```
make build-release-libadwaita
```

# Remote management

It&#039;s possible to have the LACT daemon running on one machine, and then manage it
remotely from another.

This is disabled by default, as the TCP connection **does not have any
authentication or encryption mechanism!** Make sure to only use it in trusted
networks and/or set up appropriate firewall rules.

To enable it, edit `/etc/lact/config.yaml` and add `tcp_listen_address` with
your desired address and in the `daemon` section.

Example:

```yaml
daemon:
  tcp_listen_address: 0.0.0.0:12853
  log_level: info
  admin_group: wheel
  disable_clocks_cleanup: false
```

After this restart the service (`sudo systemctl restart lactd`).

To connect to a remote instance with the GUI, run it with
`lact gui --tcp-address 192.168.1.10:12853`.

# CLI

There is also a cli available.

- List system GPUs:

  `lact cli list-gpus`

  Example output:

  ```
  10DE:2704-1462:5110-0000:09:00.0 (AD103 [GeForce RTX 4080])
  ```
- Getting GPU information:

  `lact cli info`

    `lact cli profile get` or `lact cli profile`

    Example output:

    ```
    Gaming
    ```

  - Set Profile:

    `lact cli profile set &quot;Performance&quot;`

    Example output:

    ```
    Performance
    ```

    - Auto switch profiles
      `lact cli profile auto-switch [COMMAND]`

        - Get auto-switch state:

          `lact cli profile auto-switch get` or `lact cli profile auto-switch`

          Example output:

          ```
          enabled
          ```

        - Enable auto switch:

          `lact cli profile auto-switch enable`

          Example output:

          ```
          enabled
          ```

        - Disable auto switch:

          `lact cli profile auto-switch disable`

          Example output:

          ```
          disabled
          ```

The functionality of the CLI is quite limited. If you want to integrate LACT
with some application/script, you should use the [API](API.md) instead.

# Reporting issues

When reporting issues, please include your system info and GPU model.

If you&#039;re having an issue with changing the GPU&#039;s configuration, it&#039;s highly
recommended to include a debug snapshot in the bug report. You can generate one
using the option in the dropdown menu:

![image](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/assets/22796665/36dda5e3-981b-47e7-914e-6e29f30616b4)

The snapshot is an archive which includes the SysFS that LACT uses to interact
with the GPU.

If there&#039;s a crash, run `lact gui` from the command line to get GUI logs, check
daemon logs in `journalctl -u lactd` for errors, and see `dmesg` for kernel logs
that might include information about driver and system issues.

## Install

[Download](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/releases) a pre-built binary
(installable via [gh-install](https://github.com/crate-ci/gh-install)).

Or use rust to install:
```console
$ cargo install typos-cli --locked
```

Or use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install:
```console
$ brew install typos-cli
```

Or use [Conda](https://conda.io/) to install:
```console
$ conda install typos
```

Or use [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman) to install:
```console
$ sudo pacman -S typos
```

## Getting Started

Most commonly, you&#039;ll either want to see what typos are available with
```console
$ typos
```

Or have them fixed
```console
$ typos --write-changes
$ typos -w
```
If there is any ambiguity (multiple possible corrections), `typos` will just report it to the user and move on.

### False Positives

Sometimes, what looks like a typo is intentional, like with people&#039;s names, acronyms, or localized content.

To mark a word or an identifier (grouping of words) as valid, add it to your [`_typos.toml`](docs/reference.md) by declaring itself as the valid spelling:
```toml
[default]
extend-ignore-identifiers-re = [
    # *sigh* this just isn&#039;t worth the cost of fixing
    &quot;AttributeID.*Supress.*&quot;,
]

[default.extend-identifiers]
# *sigh* this just isn&#039;t worth the cost of fixing
AttributeIDSupressMenu = &quot;AttributeIDSupressMenu&quot;

[default.extend-words]
# Don&#039;t correct the surname &quot;Teh&quot;
teh = &quot;teh&quot;
```
For more ways to ignore or extend the dictionary with examples, see the [config reference](docs/reference.md).

For cases like localized content, you can disable spell checking of file contents while still checking the file name:
```toml
[type.po]
extend-glob = [&quot;*.po&quot;]
check-file = false
```
(run `typos --type-list` to see configured file types)

If you need some more flexibility, you can completely exclude some files from consideration:
```toml
[files]
extend-exclude = [&quot;localized/*.po&quot;]
```

- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tekumara/typos-vscode)
- [typos-lsp (Language Server Protocol server)](https://github.com/tekumara/typos-vscode)

#### Custom

`typos` provides several building blocks for custom native integrations
- `-` reads from `stdin`, `--write-changes` will be written to `stdout`
- `--diff` to provide a diff
- `--format json` to get jsonlines with exit code 0 on no errors, code 2 on typos, anything else is an error.

Examples:
```console
$ # Read file from stdin, write corrected version to stdout
$ typos - --write-changes
$ # Creates a diff of what would change
$ typos dir/file --diff
$ # Fully programmatic control
$ typos dir/file --format json
```

### Debugging

You can see what the effective config looks like by running
```console
$ typos --dump-config -
```

You can then see how typos is processing your project with
```console
$ typos --files
$ typos --identifiers
$ typos --words
```

If you need to dig in more, you can enable debug logging with `-v`

## FAQ

### Why was ... not corrected?

**Does the file show up in `typos --files`?**
If not, check your config with `typos --dump-config -`.
The `[files]` table controls how we walk files.
If you are using `files.extend-exclude`,
are you running into [#593](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/593)?
If you are using `files.ignore-vcs = true`,
is the file in your `.gitignore` but git tracks it anyways?
Prefer allowing the file explicitly (see [#909](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/909)).

**Does the identifier show up in `typos --identifiers` or the word show up in `typos --words`?**
If not, it might be subject to one of typos&#039; heuristics for
detecting non-words (like hashes) or
unambiguous words (like words after a `\` escape).

If it is showing up, likely `typos` doesn&#039;t know about it yet.

`typos` maintains a list of known typo corrections to keep the false positive
count low so it can safely run unassisted.

This is in contrast to most spell checking UIs people use where there is a
known list of valid words.  In this case, the spell checker tries to guess your
intent by finding the closest-looking word.  It then has a gauge for when a
word isn&#039;t close enough and assumes you know best.  The user has the
opportunity to verify these corrections and explicitly allow or reject them.

For more on the trade offs of these approaches, see [Design](docs/design.md).

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) bindings for [Python](https://www.python.org/), including tools for creating native Python extension modules. Running and interacting with Python code from a Rust binary is also supported.

- User Guide: [stable](https://pyo3.rs) | [main](https://pyo3.rs/main)

- API Documentation: [stable](https://docs.rs/pyo3/) | [main](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc)

## Usage

Requires Rust 1.83 or greater.

PyO3 supports the following Python distributions:
  - CPython 3.7 or greater
  - PyPy 7.3 (Python 3.11+)
  - GraalPy 25.0 or greater (Python 3.12+)

You can use PyO3 to write a native Python module in Rust, or to embed Python in a Rust binary. The following sections explain each of these in turn.

### Using Rust from Python

PyO3 can be used to generate a native Python module. The easiest way to try this out for the first time is to use [`maturin`](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). `maturin` is a tool for building and publishing Rust-based Python packages with minimal configuration. The following steps install `maturin`, use it to generate and build a new Python package, and then launch Python to import and execute a function from the package.

First, follow the commands below to create a new directory containing a new Python `virtualenv`, and install `maturin` into the virtualenv using Python&#039;s package manager, `pip`:

```bash
# (replace string_sum with the desired package name)
$ mkdir string_sum
$ cd string_sum
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install maturin
```

Still inside this `string_sum` directory, now run `maturin init`. This will generate the new package source. When given the choice of bindings to use, select pyo3 bindings:

```bash
$ maturin init
✔ 🤷 What kind of bindings to use? · pyo3
  ✨ Done! New project created string_sum
```

The most important files generated by this command are `Cargo.toml` and `lib.rs`, which will look roughly like the following:

**`Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[package]
name = &quot;string_sum&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import string_sum`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.
name = &quot;string_sum&quot;
# &quot;cdylib&quot; is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
#
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use string_sum;` unless the &quot;rlib&quot; or &quot;lib&quot; crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;, &quot;rlib&quot;]
crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;]

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = &quot;0.27.1&quot;, features = [&quot;extension-module&quot;] }
```

**`src/lib.rs`**

```rust
/// A Python module implemented in Rust. The name of this module must match
/// the `lib.name` setting in the `Cargo.toml`, else Python will not be able to
/// import the module.
#[pyo3::pymodule]
mod string_sum {
  use pyo3::prelude::*;

  /// Formats the sum of two numbers as string.
  #[pyfunction]
  fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -&gt; PyResult&lt;String&gt; {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
  }
}
```

Finally, run `maturin develop`. This will build the package and install it into the Python virtualenv previously created and activated. The package is then ready to be used from `python`:

```bash
$ maturin develop
# lots of progress output as maturin runs the compilation...
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import string_sum
&gt;&gt;&gt; string_sum.sum_as_string(5, 20)
&#039;25&#039;
```

To make changes to the package, just edit the Rust source code and then re-run `maturin develop` to recompile.

To run this all as a single copy-and-paste, use the bash script below (replace `string_sum` in the first command with the desired package name):

```bash
mkdir string_sum &amp;&amp; cd &quot;$_&quot;
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin init --bindings pyo3
maturin develop
```

If you want to be able to run `cargo test` or use this project in a Cargo workspace and are running into linker issues, there are some workarounds in [the FAQ](https://pyo3.rs/latest/faq.html#i-cant-run-cargo-test-or-i-cant-build-in-a-cargo-workspace-im-having-linker-issues-like-symbol-not-found-or-undefined-reference-to-_pyexc_systemerror).

As well as with `maturin`, it is possible to build using [`setuptools-rust`](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust) or [manually](https://pyo3.rs/latest/building-and-distribution.html#manual-builds). Both offer more flexibility than `maturin` but require more configuration to get started.

### Using Python from Rust

To embed Python into a Rust binary, you need to ensure that your Python installation contains a shared library. The following steps demonstrate how to ensure this (for Ubuntu), and then give some example code which runs an embedded Python interpreter.

To install the Python shared library on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

To install the Python shared library on RPM based distributions (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, SuSE), install the `python3-devel` package.


Start a new project with `cargo new` and add  `pyo3` to the `Cargo.toml` like this:

```toml
[dependencies.pyo3]
version = &quot;0.27.1&quot;
features = [&quot;auto-initialize&quot;]
```

Example program displaying the value of `sys.version` and the current user name:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::IntoPyDict;

fn main() -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    Python::attach(|py| {
        let sys = py.import(&quot;sys&quot;)?;
        let version: String = sys.getattr(&quot;version&quot;)?.extract()?;

        let locals = [(&quot;os&quot;, py.import(&quot;os&quot;)?)].into_py_dict(py)?;
        let code = c&quot;os.getenv(&#039;USER&#039;) or os.getenv(&#039;USERNAME&#039;) or &#039;Unknown&#039;&quot;;
        let user: String = py.eval(code, None, Some(&amp;locals))?.extract()?;

        println!(&quot;Hello {}, I&#039;m Python {}&quot;, user, version);
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

The guide has [a section](https://pyo3.rs/latest/python-from-rust.html) with lots of examples
about this topic.

OpenObserve (O2 for short) is a cloud-native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, frontend monitoring and more. Start with a single binary that scales to terabytes, or deploy in High Availability mode for petabyte-scale workloads.

## Why OpenObserve?

### 1. Simplicity
It is straightforward and easy to operate compared to other observability tools that require understanding and tuning numerous settings. Get OpenObserve up and running on a single node in under 2 minutes. No PhD required. 

### 2. Cost Efficiency
You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch. Yes, you read that right - 140x, not a typo. This is achieved through columnar storage format (Parquet), aggressive compression, and S3-native architecture. See the detailed comparison below where we ingested the same amount of data in OpenObserve and Elasticsearch and found OpenObserve storage cost to be ~140x lower. Your CFO will love you.

![OpenObserve Vs Elasticsearch](./screenshots/zo_vs_es.png)

### 3. Performance
OpenObserve delivers better performance than Elasticsearch while using 1/4th the hardware resources. Users report faster search performance and significantly faster analytics queries. The columnar storage format (Parquet) with intelligent partitioning and caching reduces the search space by up to 99% for most queries. Built in Rust for memory safety and high performance, OpenObserve handles thousands of concurrent users querying a single cluster simultaneously.

### 4. Single Binary Platform
Consolidate metrics, logs, and traces on one single, efficient platform. OpenObserve comes with its own UI, eliminating the need for multiple installations. One binary to rule them all.

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenObserve achieves 140x lower storage costs and high performance through its modern architecture:

- **Parquet columnar storage**: Efficient compression and query performance
- **S3-native design**: Leverages inexpensive object storage with intelligent caching
- **Built in Rust**: Memory-safe, high-performance, single binary deployment
- **Partitioning, indexing and smart caching**: Reduces search space by up to 99% for most queries
- **Native multi-tenancy**: Organizations and streams as first-class concepts with complete data isolation
- **Stateless architecture**: Enables rapid scaling and low RPO/RTO for disaster recovery

This architecture delivers 140x cost savings while providing better performance than Elasticsearch.

### Scale &amp; Deployment

- **Thousands of concurrent users** can query a single cluster simultaneously
- **Single binary** scales to terabytes - unique in the observability space
- **High Availability mode** scales to petabytes for the most demanding workloads
- **Multi-region deployments** with cluster federation via Super Cluster architecture (Enterprise feature)
- **Federated search** across regions and clusters (Enterprise feature)
- **Capacity planning tools** to size deployments for your workload

### High Availability &amp; Disaster Recovery

Deploy in High Availability mode with clustering for mission-critical workloads requiring maximum uptime and performance.

**Low RPO/RTO**: OpenObserve&#039;s stateless architecture with S3-backed storage enables very low Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). Stateless nodes can be rapidly restarted, and data durability is guaranteed by S3&#039;s 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability. That&#039;s a lot of nines.

## ❓ FAQ

### How does OpenObserve achieve 140x lower storage costs?

Through a combination of Parquet columnar storage format (efficient compression), S3-native architecture (leveraging inexpensive object storage). See the detailed comparison chart in the &quot;Why OpenObserve?&quot; section above.

### What are the limitations?

All data in OpenObserve is **immutable** - once ingested, it cannot be modified or deleted (only entire retention periods can be dropped). This is by design and is actually a feature for logs and compliance requirements, ensuring data integrity and audit trails.

### Is this production-ready?

Yes. OpenObserve is running in production with thousands of deployments worldwide, including environments processing in excess of 2 PB/day. See our [customer stories](https://openobserve.ai/customer-stories/) for real-world examples.

### How does query performance compare to Elasticsearch?

OpenObserve delivers better performance than Elasticsearch for most workloads. Users report faster search performance and significantly faster analytics queries, all while using 1/4th the hardware resources. The columnar storage format (Parquet) is particularly effective for complex aggregations and analytics workloads.

### Is there a steep learning curve?

No. OpenObserve is designed to be intuitive from day one:
- **Familiar query languages**: Use SQL for logs and traces, PromQL for metrics - no proprietary query language to learn
- **Easy-to-use GUI**: Intuitive interface with drag-and-drop dashboard builder
- **Helpful community**: Active Slack community and comprehensive documentation to help you get started quickly
- **No complex tuning**: Unlike Elasticsearch, you don&#039;t need to understand shards, replicas, heap sizes, or other complex configurations. Just install and go.

Most users are productive within hours, not weeks. Some even claim minutes, but we&#039;ll let you be the judge.

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

It&#039;s pronounced as &quot;you - vee&quot; ([`/juː viː/`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key))

#### How should I stylize uv?

Just &quot;uv&quot;, please. See the [style guide](./STYLE.md#styling-uv) for details.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

## Overview

Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using disk space without requiring sort or head. Dust will print a maximum of one &#039;Did not have permissions message&#039;.

Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the larger ones. There is no need for a &#039;-d&#039; flag or a &#039;-h&#039; flag. The largest subdirectories will be colored.

The different colors on the bars: These represent the combined tree hierarchy &amp; disk usage. The shades of grey are used to indicate which parent folder a subfolder belongs to. For instance, look at the above screenshot. `.steam` is a folder taking 44% of the space. From the `.steam` bar is a light grey line that goes up. All these folders are inside `.steam` so if you delete `.steam` all that stuff will be gone too.

## Usage

```
Usage: dust
Usage: dust &lt;dir&gt;
Usage: dust &lt;dir&gt;  &lt;another_dir&gt; &lt;and_more&gt;
Usage: dust -p (full-path - Show fullpath of the subdirectories)
Usage: dust -s (apparent-size - shows the length of the file as opposed to the amount of disk space it uses)
Usage: dust -n 30  (Shows 30 directories instead of the default [default is terminal height])
Usage: dust -d 3  (Shows 3 levels of subdirectories)
Usage: dust -D (Show only directories (eg dust -D))
Usage: dust -F (Show only files - finds your largest files)
Usage: dust -r (reverse order of output)
Usage: dust -o si/b/kb/kib/mb/mib/gb/gib (si - prints sizes in powers of 1000. Others print size in that format).
Usage: dust -X ignore  (ignore all files and directories with the name &#039;ignore&#039;)
Usage: dust -x (Only show directories on the same filesystem)
Usage: dust -b (Do not show percentages or draw ASCII bars)
Usage: dust -B (--bars-on-right - Percent bars moved to right side of screen)
Usage: dust -i (Do not show hidden files)
Usage: dust -c (No colors [monochrome])
Usage: dust -C (Force colors)
Usage: dust -f (Count files instead of diskspace [Counts by inode, to include duplicate inodes use dust -f -s])
Usage: dust -t (Group by filetype)
Usage: dust -z 10M (min-size, Only include files larger than 10M)
Usage: dust -e regex (Only include files matching this regex (eg dust -e &quot;\.png$&quot; would match png files))
Usage: dust -v regex (Exclude files matching this regex (eg dust -v &quot;\.png$&quot; would ignore png files))
Usage: dust -L (dereference-links - Treat sym links as directories and go into them)
Usage: dust -P (Disable the progress indicator)
Usage: dust -R (For screen readers. Removes bars/symbols. Adds new column: depth level. (May want to use -p for full path too))
Usage: dust -S (Custom Stack size - Use if you see: &#039;fatal runtime error: stack overflow&#039; (default allocation: low memory=1048576, high memory=1073741824)&quot;),
Usage: dust --skip-total (No total row will be displayed)
Usage: dust -z 40000/30MB/20kib (Exclude output files/directories below size 40000 bytes / 30MB / 20KiB)
Usage: dust -j (Prints JSON representation of directories, try: dust -j  | jq)
Usage: dust --files0-from=FILE (Read NUL-terminated file paths from FILE; if FILE is &#039;-&#039;, read from stdin)
Usage: dust --files-from=FILE (Read newline-terminated file paths from FILE; if FILE is &#039;-&#039;, read from stdin)
Usage: dust --collapse=node-modules will keep the node-modules folder collapsed in display instead of recursively opening it
```

## Config file

Dust has a config file where the above options can be set.
Either: `~/.config/dust/config.toml` or `~/.dust.toml`
```
$ cat ~/.config/dust/config.toml
reverse=true
```

## Alternatives

- [NCDU](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)
- [dutree](https://github.com/nachoparker/dutree)
- [dua](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/)
- [pdu](https://github.com/KSXGitHub/parallel-disk-usage)
- [dirstat-rs](https://github.com/scullionw/dirstat-rs)
- `du -d 1 -h | sort -h`

Note: Apparent-size is calculated slightly differently in dust to gdu. In dust each hard link is counted as using file_length space. In gdu only the first entry is counted.
