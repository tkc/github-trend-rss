Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. It’s based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) C library and the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary&#039;s name may change (i.e.
away from `jj`). For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant
preview, you can also check out [Typst&#039;s free web app][app].

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /taɪpst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

&lt;h1&gt;Kaspa On Rust&lt;/h1&gt;

Welcome to the Rust-based implementation of the Kaspa full-node and its ancillary libraries. The contained node release serves as a drop-in replacement to the established &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kaspanet/kaspad&quot;&gt;Golang node&lt;/a&gt; and to date is the recommended node software for the Kaspa network, introducing developers to the possibilities of Rust in the Kaspa network&#039;s context.

We invite developers and blockchain enthusiasts to collaborate, test, and optimize our Rust implementation. Each line of code here is an opportunity to contribute to the open-source blockchain movement, shaping a platform designed for scalability and speed without compromising on security and decentralization.

Your feedback, contributions, and issue reports will be integral to evolving this codebase and continuing its maturity as a reliable node in the Kaspa network.

The default branch of this repository is `master` and new contributions are constantly merged into it. For a stable branch corresponding to the latest stable release please pull and compile the `stable` branch. 

## The Crescendo Hardfork  

The Crescendo Hardfork, which will transition the network to 10 BPS, is scheduled to activate on mainnet at DAA Score **110,165,000**, projected to occur on **May 5, 2025, at approximately 15:00 UTC**. Note that 24 hours before activation, nodes will connect only to upgraded peers which are using the new P2P protocol version 7.  

You are encouraged to verify your client software against this mainnet version ahead of or after the hardfork. For a more controlled environment, consider using **Testnet 10**, where the Crescendo changes are already active. Refer to the [Crescendo guide](docs/crescendo-guide.md) for detailed instructions.



## Installation
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Building on Linux&lt;/summary&gt;

  1. Install general prerequisites

      ```bash
      sudo apt install curl git build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config
      ```

  2. Install Protobuf (required for gRPC)

      ```bash
      sudo apt install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev #Required for gRPC
      ```
  3. Install the clang toolchain (required for RocksDB and WASM secp256k1 builds)

      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install clang-format clang-tidy \
      clang-tools clang clangd libc++-dev \
      libc++1 libc++abi-dev libc++abi1 \
      libclang-dev libclang1 liblldb-dev \
      libllvm-ocaml-dev libomp-dev libomp5 \
      lld lldb llvm-dev llvm-runtime \
      llvm python3-clang
      ```
  3. Install the [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

     If you already have rust installed, update it by running: `rustup update`
  4. Install wasm-pack
      ```bash
      cargo install wasm-pack
      ```
  4. Install wasm32 target
      ```bash
      rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
      ```
  5. Clone the repo
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa
      cd rusty-kaspa
      ```
  &lt;/details&gt;



  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Building on Windows&lt;/summary&gt;


  1. [Install Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) or an alternative Git distribution.

  2. Install [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.10/protoc-21.10-win64.zip) and add the `bin` directory to your `Path`


3. Install [LLVM-15.0.6-win64.exe](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-15.0.6/LLVM-15.0.6-win64.exe)

    Add the `bin` directory of the LLVM installation (`C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`) to PATH

    set `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable to point to the `bin` directory as well

    **IMPORTANT:** Due to C++ dependency configuration issues, LLVM `AR` installation on Windows may not function correctly when switching between WASM and native C++ code compilation (native `RocksDB+secp256k1` vs WASM32 builds of `secp256k1`). Unfortunately, manually setting `AR` environment variable also confuses C++ build toolchain (it should not be set for native but should be set for WASM32 targets). Currently, the best way to address this, is as follows: after installing LLVM on Windows, go to the target `bin` installation directory and copy or rename `LLVM_AR.exe` to `AR.exe`.

  4. Install the [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

     If you already have rust installed, update it by running: `rustup update`
  5. Install wasm-pack
      ```bash
      cargo install wasm-pack
      ```
  6. Install wasm32 target
      ```bash
      rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
      ```
  7. Clone the repo
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa
      cd rusty-kaspa
      ```
 &lt;/details&gt;


  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Building on Mac OS&lt;/summary&gt;


  1. Install Protobuf (required for gRPC)
      ```bash
      brew install protobuf
      ```
  2. Install llvm.

      The default XCode installation of `llvm` does not support WASM build targets.
To build WASM on MacOS you need to install `llvm` from homebrew (at the time of writing, the llvm version for MacOS is 16.0.1).
      ```bash
      brew install llvm
      ```

      **NOTE:** Homebrew can use different keg installation locations depending on your configuration. For example:
      - `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm` -&gt; `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1`
      - `/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1`

      To determine the installation location you can use `brew list llvm` command and then modify the paths below accordingly:
      ```bash
      % brew list llvm
      /usr/local/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1/bin/FileCheck
      /usr/local/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1/bin/UnicodeNameMappingGenerator
      ...
      ```
      If you have `/opt/homebrew/Cellar`, then you should be able to use `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm`.

      Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:
      ```bash
      export PATH=&quot;/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH&quot;
      export LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib&quot;
      export CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include&quot;
      export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
      ```

      Reload the `~/.zshrc` file
      ```bash
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```
  3. Install the [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

     If you already have rust installed, update it by running: `rustup update`
  4. Install wasm-pack
      ```bash
      cargo install wasm-pack
      ```
  4. Install wasm32 target
      ```bash
      rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
      ```
  5. Clone the repo
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa
      cd rusty-kaspa
      ```

 &lt;/details&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Building WASM32 SDK&lt;/summary&gt;

  Rust WebAssembly (WASM) refers to the use of the Rust programming language to write code that can be compiled into WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that runs in web browsers and NodeJs. This allows for easy development using JavaScript and TypeScript programming languages while retaining the benefits of Rust.

  WASM SDK components can be built from sources by running:
    - `./build-release` - build a full release package (includes both release and debug builds for web and nodejs targets)
    - `./build-docs` - build TypeScript documentation
    - `./build-web` - release web build
    - `./build-web-dev` - development web build
    - `./build-nodejs` - release nodejs build
    - `./build-nodejs-dev` - development nodejs build

  IMPORTANT: do not use `dev` builds in production. They are significantly larger, slower and include debug symbols.

### Requirements

  - NodeJs (v20+): https://nodejs.org/en
  - TypeDoc: https://typedoc.org/

### Builds &amp; documentation

  - Release builds: https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/releases
  - Developer builds: https://kaspa.aspectron.org/nightly/downloads/
  - Developer TypeScript documentation: https://kaspa.aspectron.org/docs/

  &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;
Kaspa CLI + Wallet
&lt;/summary&gt;

`kaspa-cli` crate provides a cli-driven RPC interface to the node and a
terminal interface to the Rusty Kaspa Wallet runtime. These wallets are
compatible with WASM SDK Wallet API and Kaspa NG projects.


```bash
cd cli
cargo run --release
```

&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;
Local Web Wallet
&lt;/summary&gt;

Run an http server inside of `wallet/wasm/web` folder. If you don&#039;t have once, you can use the following:

```bash
cd wallet/wasm/web
cargo install basic-http-server
basic-http-server
```
The *basic-http-server* will serve on port 4000 by default, so open your web browser and load http://localhost:4000

The framework is compatible with all major desktop and mobile browsers.


&lt;/details&gt;


## Running the node

  **Start a mainnet node**

  ```bash
  cargo run --release --bin kaspad
  # or with UTXO-index enabled (needed when using wallets)
  cargo run --release --bin kaspad -- --utxoindex
  ```
  **Start a testnet node**

  ```bash
cargo run --release --bin kaspad -- --testnet
  ```

  **Testnet 11**

  For participation in the 10BPS test network (TN11), see the following detailed [guide](docs/testnet11.md).

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;
Using a configuration file
  &lt;/summary&gt;

  ```bash
cargo run --release --bin kaspad -- --configfile /path/to/configfile.toml
# or
cargo run --release --bin kaspad -- -C /path/to/configfile.toml
  ```
  - The config file should be a list of \&lt;CLI argument\&gt; = \&lt;value\&gt; separated by newlines.
  - Whitespace around the `=` is fine, `arg=value` and `arg = value` are both parsed correctly.
  - Values with special characters like `.` or `=` will require quoting the value i.e \&lt;CLI argument\&gt; = &quot;\&lt;value\&gt;&quot;.
  - Arguments with multiple values should be surrounded with brackets like `addpeer = [&quot;10.0.0.1&quot;, &quot;1.2.3.4&quot;]`.

  For example:
  ```
testnet = true
utxoindex = false
disable-upnp = true
perf-metrics = true
appdir = &quot;some-dir&quot;
netsuffix = 11
addpeer = [&quot;10.0.0.1&quot;, &quot;1.2.3.4&quot;]
  ```
 Pass the `--help` flag to view all possible arguments

  ```bash
cargo run --release --bin kaspad -- --help
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;
wRPC
  &lt;/summary&gt;

  wRPC subsystem is disabled by default in `kaspad` and can be enabled via:


  JSON protocol:
  ```bash
  --rpclisten-json = &lt;interface:port&gt;
  # or use the defaults for current network
  --rpclisten-json = default
  ```

  Borsh protocol:
  ```bash
  --rpclisten-borsh = &lt;interface:port&gt;
  # or use the defaults for current network
  --rpclisten-borsh = default
  ```

  **Sidenote:**

  Rusty Kaspa integrates an optional wRPC
  subsystem. wRPC is a high-performance, platform-neutral, Rust-centric, WebSocket-framed RPC
  implementation that can use [Borsh](https://borsh.io/) and JSON protocol encoding.

  JSON protocol messaging
  is similar to JSON-RPC 1.0, but differs from the specification due to server-side
  notifications.

  [Borsh](https://borsh.io/) encoding is meant for inter-process communication. When using [Borsh](https://borsh.io/)
  both client and server should be built from the same codebase.

  JSON protocol is based on
  Kaspa data structures and is data-structure-version agnostic. You can connect to the
  JSON endpoint using any WebSocket library. Built-in RPC clients for JavaScript and
  TypeScript capable of running in web browsers and Node.js are available as a part of
  the Kaspa WASM framework.

&lt;/details&gt;


## Benchmarking &amp; Testing


&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Simulation framework (Simpa)&lt;/summary&gt;

The current codebase supports a full in-process network simulation, building an actual DAG over virtual time with virtual delay and benchmarking validation time (following the simulation generation).

To see the available commands
```bash
cargo run --release --bin simpa -- --help
```

The following command will run a simulation to produce 1000 blocks with communication delay of 2 seconds and 8 BPS (blocks per second) while attempting to fill each block with up to 200 transactions.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin simpa -- -t=200 -d=2 -b=8 -n=1000
```

&lt;/details&gt;




&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Heap Profiling&lt;/summary&gt;

Heap-profiling in `kaspad` and `simpa` can be done by enabling `heap` feature and profile using the `--features` argument

```bash
cargo run --bin kaspad --profile heap --features=heap
```

It will produce `{bin-name}-heap.json` file in the root of the workdir, that can be inspected by the [dhat-viewer](https://github.com/unofficial-mirror/valgrind/tree/master/dhat)

&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Tests&lt;/summary&gt;


**Run unit and most integration tests**

```bash
cd rusty-kaspa
cargo test --release
// or install nextest and run
```



**Using nextest**

```bash
cd rusty-kaspa
cargo nextest run --release
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Lints&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
cd rusty-kaspa
./check
```

&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
cd rusty-kaspa
cargo bench
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Logging&lt;/summary&gt;

Logging in `kaspad` and `simpa` can be [filtered](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.10.0/env_logger/#filtering-results) by either:

1. Defining the environment variable `RUST_LOG`
2. Adding the --loglevel argument like in the following example:

    ```
    (cargo run --bin kaspad -- --loglevel info,kaspa_rpc_core=trace,kaspa_grpc_core=trace,consensus=trace,kaspa_core=trace) 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee ~/rusty-kaspa.log
    ```
    In this command we set the `loglevel` to `INFO`.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.


&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and Gnu Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

# Rustlings 🦀❤️

&lt;/div&gt;

Greetings and welcome to Rustlings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Rustlings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust 📚️

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is another recommended resource that you might find helpful.
It contains code examples and exercises similar to Rustlings, but online.

## Getting Started

### Installing Rust

Before installing Rustlings, you need to have the **latest version of Rust** installed.
Visit [www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for further instructions on installing Rust.
This will also install _Cargo_, Rust&#039;s package/project manager.

&gt; 🐧 If you are on Linux, make sure you have installed `gcc` (for a linker).
&gt;
&gt; Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`
&gt;
&gt; Dnf: `sudo dnf install gcc`

&gt; 🍎 If you are on MacOS, make sure you have installed Xcode and its developer tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

### Installing Rustlings

The following command will download and compile Rustlings:

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the installation fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

- Make sure you have the latest Rust version by running `rustup update`
- Try adding the `--locked` flag: `cargo install rustlings --locked`
- Otherwise, please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new)

&lt;/details&gt;

### Initialization

After installing Rustlings, run the following command to initialize the `rustlings/` directory:

```bash
rustlings init
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the command &lt;code&gt;rustlings&lt;/code&gt; can&#039;t be found…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

You are probably using Linux and installed Rust using your package manager.

Cargo installs binaries to the directory `~/.cargo/bin`.
Sadly, package managers often don&#039;t add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.

The solution is to …

- either add `~/.cargo/bin` manually to `PATH`
- or to uninstall Rust from the package manager and install it using the official way with `rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

&lt;/details&gt;

Now, go into the newly initialized directory and launch Rustlings for further instructions on getting started with the exercises:

```bash
cd rustlings/
rustlings
```

## Working environment

### Editor

Our general recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [rust-analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
But any editor that supports [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) should be enough for working on the exercises.

### Terminal

While working with Rustlings, please use a modern terminal for the best user experience.
The default terminal on Linux and Mac should be sufficient.
On Windows, we recommend the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `exercises/&lt;topic&gt;`.
For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.
We highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start 📚️

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it&#039;s up to you to fix it!
Some exercises contain tests that need to pass for the exercise to be done ✅

Search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to find out what you need to change.
Ask for hints by entering `h` in the _watch mode_ 💡

### Watch Mode

After the [initialization](#initialization), Rustlings can be launched by simply running the command `rustlings`.

This will start the _watch mode_ which walks you through the exercises in a predefined order (what we think is best for newcomers).
It will rerun the current exercise automatically every time you change the exercise&#039;s file in the `exercises/` directory.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If detecting file changes in the &lt;code&gt;exercises/&lt;/code&gt; directory fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; You can add the **`--manual-run`** flag (`rustlings --manual-run`) to manually rerun the current exercise by entering `r` in the watch mode.
&gt;
&gt; Please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new) with some information about your operating system and whether you run Rustlings in a container or virtual machine (e.g. WSL).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Exercise List

In the [watch mode](#watch-mode) (after launching `rustlings`), you can enter `l` to open the interactive exercise list.

The list allows you to…

- See the status of all exercises (done or pending)
- `c`: Continue at another exercise (temporarily skip some exercises or go back to a previous one)
- `r`: Reset status and file of the selected exercise (you need to _reload/reopen_ its file in your editor afterwards)

See the footer of the list for all possible keys.

## Questions?

If you need any help while doing the exercises and the builtin-hints aren&#039;t helpful, feel free to ask in the [_Q&amp;A_ category of the discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=) if your question wasn&#039;t asked yet 💡

## Third-Party Exercises

Third-party exercises are a set of exercises maintained by the community.
You can use the same `rustlings` program that you installed with `cargo install rustlings` to run them:

- 🇯🇵 [Japanese Rustlings](https://github.com/sotanengel/rustlings-jp)：A Japanese translation of the Rustlings exercises.
- 🇨🇳 [Simplified Chinese Rustlings](https://github.com/SandmeyerX/rustlings-zh-cn): A simplified Chinese translation of the Rustlings exercises.

Do you want to create your own set of Rustlings exercises to focus on some specific topic?
Or do you want to translate the original Rustlings exercises?
Then follow the the guide about [third-party exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_EXERCISES.md)!

## Continuing On

Once you&#039;ve completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use!
Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.

## Uninstalling Rustlings

If you want to remove Rustlings from your system, run the following command:

```bash
cargo uninstall rustlings
```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Here be dragons! As we plan to ship a torrent of features in the following months, future updates **will** contain **breaking changes**. With Rig evolving, we&#039;ll annotate changes and highlight migration paths as we encounter them.


## What is Rig?
Rig is a Rust library for building scalable, modular, and ergonomic **LLM-powered** applications.

More information about this crate can be found in the [official](https://docs.rig.rs) &amp; [crate](https://docs.rs/rig-core/latest/rig/) (API Reference) documentations.

## High-level features
- Full support for LLM completion and embedding workflows
- Simple but powerful common abstractions over LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere) and vector stores (e.g. MongoDB, SQlite, in-memory)
- Integrate LLMs in your app with minimal boilerplate



## Get Started
```bash
cargo add rig-core
```

### Simple example:
```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent(&quot;gpt-4&quot;).build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;)
        .await
        .expect(&quot;Failed to prompt GPT-4&quot;);

    println!(&quot;GPT-4: {response}&quot;);
}
```
Note using `#[tokio::main]` requires you enable tokio&#039;s `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` features
or just `full` to enable all features (`cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread`).

You can find more examples each crate&#039;s `examples` (ie. [`rig-core/examples`](./rig-core/examples)) directory. More detailed use cases walkthroughs are regularly published on our [Dev.to Blog](https://dev.to/0thtachi) and added to Rig&#039;s official documentation [(docs.rig.rs)](http://docs.rig.rs).

## What&#039;s Loco?
`Loco` is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you&#039;ll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you&#039;ll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

For a deeper dive into how Loco works, including detailed guides, examples, and API references, check out our [documentation website](https://loco.rs).


## Features of Loco:

* `Convention Over Configuration:` Similar to Ruby on Rails, Loco emphasizes simplicity and productivity by reducing the need for boilerplate code. It uses sensible defaults, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than spending time on configuration.

* `Rapid Development:` Aim for high developer productivity, Loco’s design focuses on reducing boilerplate code and providing intuitive APIs, allowing developers to iterate quickly and build prototypes with minimal effort.

* `ORM Integration:` Model your business with robust entities, eliminating the need to write SQL. Define relationships, validation, and custom logic directly on your entities for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

* `Controllers`: Handle web requests parameters, body, validation, and render a response that is content-aware. We use Axum for the best performance, simplicity, and extensibility. Controllers also allow you to easily build middlewares, which can be used to add logic such as authentication, logging, or error handling before passing requests to the main controller actions.

* `Views:` Loco can integrate with templating engines to generate dynamic HTML content from templates.

* `Background Jobs:` Perform compute or I/O intensive jobs in the background with a Redis backed queue, or with threads. Implementing a worker is as simple as implementing a perform function for the Worker trait.

* `Scheduler:` Simplifies the traditional, often cumbersome crontab system, making it easier and more elegant to schedule tasks or shell scripts.

* `Mailers:` A mailer will deliver emails in the background using the existing loco background worker infrastructure. It will all be seamless for you.

* `Storage:` In Loco Storage, we facilitate working with files through multiple operations. Storage can be in-memory, on disk, or use cloud services such as AWS S3, GCP, and Azure.

* `Cache:` Loco provides an cache layer to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data.

## Getting Started
&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;quick-installation-command&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
cargo install loco
cargo install sea-orm-cli # Only when DB is needed
```
&lt;!-- &lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

Now you can create your new app (choose &quot;`SaaS` app&quot;).


&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;loco-cli-new-from-template&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
❯ loco new
✔ ❯ App name? · myapp
✔ ❯ What would you like to build? · Saas App with client side rendering
✔ ❯ Select a DB Provider · Sqlite
✔ ❯ Select your background worker type · Async (in-process tokio async tasks)

🚂 Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp/

- assets: You&#039;ve selected `clientside` for your asset serving configuration.

Next step, build your frontend:
  $ cd frontend/
  $ npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build
```
&lt;!-- &lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

 Now `cd` into your `myapp` and start your app:
&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;starting-the-server-command-with-output&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
$ cargo loco start

source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you are running these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, otherwise the application might not be able to find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

# The master branch is the pre-release, development version of `tracing`. Please see the [v0.1.x](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/tree/v0.1.x) branch for the versions of `tracing` released to crates.io.

## Overview

`tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. `tracing` is maintained by the
Tokio project, but does _not_ require the `tokio` runtime to be used.

## Usage

### In Applications

In order to record trace events, executables have to use a collector
implementation compatible with `tracing`. A collector implements a way of
collecting trace data, such as by logging it to standard output.
[`tracing-subscriber`][tracing-subscriber-docs]&#039;s [`fmt` module][fmt] provides
a collector for logging traces with reasonable defaults. Additionally,
`tracing-subscriber` is able to consume messages emitted by `log`-instrumented
libraries and modules.

To use `tracing-subscriber`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing = &quot;0.1&quot;
tracing-subscriber = &quot;0.3&quot;
```

Then create and install a collector, for example using [`init()`]:

```rust
use tracing::info;
use tracing_subscriber;

fn main() {
    // install global collector configured based on RUST_LOG env var.
    tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();

    let number_of_yaks = 3;
    // this creates a new event, outside of any spans.
    info!(number_of_yaks, &quot;preparing to shave yaks&quot;);

    let number_shaved = yak_shave::shave_all(number_of_yaks);
    info!(
        all_yaks_shaved = number_shaved == number_of_yaks,
        &quot;yak shaving completed.&quot;
    );
}
```

Using `init()` calls [`set_global_default()`] so this collector will be used
as the default in all threads for the remainder of the duration of the
program, similar to how loggers work in the `log` crate.

[tracing-subscriber-docs]: https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/
[fmt]: https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/fmt/index.html
[`set_global_default`]: https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/subscriber/fn.set_global_default.html


For more control, a collector can be built in stages and not set globally,
but instead used to locally override the default collector. For example:

```rust
use tracing::{info, Level};
use tracing_subscriber;

fn main() {
    let collector = tracing_subscriber::fmt()
        // filter spans/events with level TRACE or higher.
        .with_max_level(Level::TRACE)
        // build but do not install the subscriber.
        .finish();

    tracing::collect::with_default(collector, || {
        info!(&quot;This will be logged to stdout&quot;);
    });
    info!(&quot;This will _not_ be logged to stdout&quot;);
}
```

Any trace events generated outside the context of a collector will not be collected.

This approach allows trace data to be collected by multiple collectors
within different contexts in the program. Note that the override only applies to the
currently executing thread; other threads will not see the change from with_default.

Once a collector has been set, instrumentation points may be added to the
executable using the `tracing` crate&#039;s macros.

[`set_global_default()`]: https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/subscriber/fn.set_global_default.html

### In Libraries

Libraries should only rely on the `tracing` crate and use the provided macros
and types to collect whatever information might be useful to downstream consumers.

```rust
use std::{error::Error, io};
use tracing::{debug, error, info, span, warn, Level};

// the `#[tracing::instrument]` attribute creates and enters a span
// every time the instrumented function is called. The span is named after
// the function or method. Parameters passed to the function are recorded as fields.
#[tracing::instrument]
pub fn shave(yak: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error + &#039;static&gt;&gt; {
    // this creates an event at the DEBUG level with two fields:
    // - `excitement`, with the key &quot;excitement&quot; and the value &quot;yay!&quot;
    // - `message`, with the key &quot;message&quot; and the value &quot;hello! I&#039;m gonna shave a yak.&quot;
    //
    // unlike other fields, `message`&#039;s shorthand initialization is just the string itself.
    debug!(excitement = &quot;yay!&quot;, &quot;hello! I&#039;m gonna shave a yak.&quot;);
    if yak == 3 {
        warn!(&quot;could not locate yak!&quot;);
        // note that this is intended to demonstrate `tracing`&#039;s features, not idiomatic
        // error handling! in a library or application, you should consider returning
        // a dedicated `YakError`. libraries like snafu or thiserror make this easy.
        return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, &quot;shaving yak failed!&quot;).into());
    } else {
        debug!(&quot;yak shaved successfully&quot;);
    }
    Ok(())
}

pub fn shave_all(yaks: usize) -&gt; usize {
    // Constructs a new span named &quot;shaving_yaks&quot; at the TRACE level,
    // and a field whose key is &quot;yaks&quot;. This is equivalent to writing:
    //
    // let span = span!(Level::TRACE, &quot;shaving_yaks&quot;, yaks = yaks);
    //
    // local variables (`yaks`) can be used as field values
    // without an assignment, similar to struct initializers.
    let span = span!(Level::TRACE, &quot;shaving_yaks&quot;, yaks);
    let _enter = span.enter();

    info!(&quot;shaving yaks&quot;);

    let mut yaks_shaved = 0;
    for yak in 1..=yaks {
        let res = shave(yak);
        debug!(yak, shaved = res.is_ok());

        if let Err(ref error) = res {
            // Like spans, events can also use the field initialization shorthand.
            // In this instance, `yak` is the field being initialized.
            error!(yak, error = error.as_ref(), &quot;failed to shave yak!&quot;);
        } else {
            yaks_shaved += 1;
        }
        debug!(yaks_shaved);
    }

    yaks_shaved
}
```

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing = &quot;0.1&quot;
```

Note: Libraries should *NOT* install a collector by using a method that calls
[`set_global_default()`], as this will cause conflicts when executables try to
set the default later.

### In Asynchronous Code

To trace `async fn`s, the preferred method is using the [`#[instrument]`][instrument] attribute:

```rust
use tracing::{info, instrument};
use tokio::{io::AsyncWriteExt, net::TcpStream};
use std::io;

#[instrument]
async fn write(stream: &amp;mut TcpStream) -&gt; io::Result&lt;usize&gt; {
    let result = stream.write(b&quot;hello world\n&quot;).await;
    info!(&quot;wrote to stream; success={:?}&quot;, result.is_ok());
    result
}
```

Special handling is needed for the general case of code using
[`std::future::Future`][std-future] or blocks with `async`/`await`, as the
following example _will not_ work:

```rust
async {
    let _s = span.enter();
    // ...
}
```

The span guard `_s` will not exit until the future generated by the `async` block is complete.
Since futures and spans can be entered and exited _multiple_ times without them completing,
the span remains entered for as long as the future exists, rather than being entered only when
it is polled, leading to very confusing and incorrect output.
For more details, see [the documentation on closing spans][closing].

This problem can be solved using the [`Future::instrument`] combinator:

```rust
use tracing::Instrument;

let my_future = async {
    // ...
};

my_future
    .instrument(tracing::info_span!(&quot;my_future&quot;))
    .await
```

`Future::instrument` attaches a span to the future, ensuring that the span&#039;s lifetime
is as long as the future&#039;s.

Under the hood, the [`#[instrument]`][instrument] macro performs the same explicit span
attachment that `Future::instrument` does.

## Supported Rust Versions

Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.63. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on Rust
versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable
compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be increased
past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler
version is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies
with this policy.

## Project layout

The [`tracing`] crate contains the primary _instrumentation_ API, used for
instrumenting libraries and applications to emit trace data. The [`tracing-core`]
crate contains the _core_ API primitives on which the rest of `tracing` is
instrumented. Authors of trace subscribers may depend on `tracing-core`, which
guarantees a higher level of stability.

Additionally, this repository contains several compatibility and utility
libraries built on top of `tracing`. Some of these crates are in a pre-release
state, and are less stable than the `tracing` and `tracing-core` crates.

&lt;br&gt;

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property &#039;importKey&#039;`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.
&gt;
&gt;This can be configured in [Vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a third-party reverse proxy ([some examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).
&gt;
&gt;If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let&#039;s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy or Traefik (see examples linked above).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

The main way to use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 80:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

&lt;br&gt;

## Features and Roadmap

Limbo is a _work-in-progress_, in-process OLTP database engine library written in Rust that has:

* **Asynchronous I/O** support on Linux with `io_uring`
* **SQLite compatibility** [[doc](COMPAT.md)] for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API
* **Language bindings** for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Rust, Go, Python, and [Java](bindings/java)
* **OS support** for Linux, macOS, and Windows

In the future, we will be also working on:

* **Integrated vector search** for embeddings and vector similarity.
* **`BEGIN CONCURRENT`** for improved write throughput.
* **Improved schema management** including better `ALTER` support and strict column types by default.

## Getting Started

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Command Line&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can install the latest `limbo` release with:

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/releases/latest/download/limbo_cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Then launch the shell to execute SQL statements:

```console
Limbo
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use &quot;.open FILENAME&quot; to reopen on a persistent database
limbo&gt; CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#039;alice&#039;);
limbo&gt; INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, &#039;bob&#039;);
limbo&gt; SELECT * FROM users;
1|alice
2|bob
```

You can also build and run the latest development version with:

```shell
cargo run
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🦀 Rust&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
cargo add limbo
```

Example usage:

```rust
let db = Builder::new_local(&quot;sqlite.db&quot;).build().await?;
let conn = db.connect()?;

let res = conn.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;, ()).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;✨ JavaScript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
npm i limbo-wasm
```

Example usage:

```js
import { Database } from &#039;limbo-wasm&#039;;

const db = new Database(&#039;sqlite.db&#039;);
const stmt = db.prepare(&#039;SELECT * FROM users&#039;);
const users = stmt.all();
console.log(users);
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 Python&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```console
pip install pylimbo
```

Example usage:

```python
import limbo

&lt;summary&gt;🐹 Go&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the library and set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include limbo&#039;s target directory
```console
cargo build --package limbo-go
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/limbo/target/debug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
3. Use the driver

```console
go get github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
go install github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
```

Example usage:
```go
import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _&quot;github.com/tursodatabase/limbo&quot;
)

conn, _ = sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;sqlite.db&quot;)
defer conn.Close()

stmt, _ := conn.Prepare(&quot;select * from users&quot;)
defer stmt.Close()

rows, _ = stmt.Query()
for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var username string
    _ := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;username)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;User: ID: %d, Username: %s\n&quot;, id, username)
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## FAQ

### How is Limbo different from Turso&#039;s libSQL?

Limbo is a project to build the modern evolution of SQLite in Rust, with a strong open contribution focus and features like native async support, vector search, and more. The libSQL project is also an attempt to evolve SQLite in a similar direction, but through a fork rather than a rewrite.

Rewriting SQLite in Rust started as an unassuming experiment, and due to its incredible success, replaces libSQL as our intended direction. At this point, libSQL is production ready, Limbo is not - although it is evolving rapidly. As the project starts to near production readiness, we plan to rename it to just &quot;Turso&quot;. More details [here](https://turso.tech/blog/we-will-rewrite-sqlite-and-we-are-going-all-in).

# TensorZero

**TensorZero creates a feedback loop for optimizing LLM applications — turning production data into smarter, faster, and cheaper models.**

1. Integrate our model gateway
2. Send metrics or feedback
3. Optimize prompts, models, and inference strategies
4. Watch your LLMs improve over time

It provides a **data &amp; learning flywheel for LLMs** by unifying:

- [x] **Inference:** one API for all LLMs, with &lt;1ms P99 overhead
- [x] **Observability:** inference &amp; feedback → your database
- [x] **Optimization:** from prompts to fine-tuning and RL
- [x] **Evaluations:** compare prompts, models, inference strategies
- [x] **Experimentation:** built-in A/B testing, routing, fallbacks

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is TensorZero?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;TensorZero is an open-source framework for building production-grade LLM applications. It unifies an LLM gateway, observability, optimization, evaluations, and experimentation.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How is TensorZero different from other LLM frameworks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
      1. TensorZero enables you to optimize complex LLM applications based on production metrics and human feedback.&lt;br&gt;
      2. TensorZero supports the needs of industrial-scale LLM applications: low latency, high throughput, type safety, self-hosted, GitOps, customizability, etc.&lt;br&gt;
      3. TensorZero unifies the entire LLMOps stack, creating compounding benefits. For example, LLM evaluations can be used for fine-tuning models alongside AI judges.
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I use TensorZero with ___?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Yes. Every major programming language is supported. You can use TensorZero with our Python client, any OpenAI SDK, or our HTTP API.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is TensorZero production-ready?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Yes. Here&#039;s a case study: &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorzero.com/blog/case-study-automating-code-changelogs-at-a-large-bank-with-llms&quot;&gt;Automating Code Changelogs at a Large Bank with LLMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much does TensorZero cost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Nothing. TensorZero is 100% self-hosted and open-source. There are no paid features.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is building TensorZero?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Our technical team includes a former Rust compiler maintainer, machine learning researchers (Stanford, CMU, Oxford, Columbia) with thousands of citations, and the chief product officer of a decacorn startup. We&#039;re backed by the same investors as leading open-source projects (e.g. ClickHouse, CockroachDB) and AI labs (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic).&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;You can adopt TensorZero incrementally. Our &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorzero.com/docs/quickstart&quot;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; goes from a vanilla OpenAI wrapper to a production-ready LLM application with observability and fine-tuning in just 5 minutes.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

LanceDB is an open-source database for vector-search built with persistent storage, which greatly simplifies retrieval, filtering and management of embeddings.

The key features of LanceDB include:

* Production-scale vector search with no servers to manage.

* Store, query and filter vectors, metadata and multi-modal data (text, images, videos, point clouds, and more).

* Support for vector similarity search, full-text search and SQL.

* Native Python and Javascript/Typescript support.

* Zero-copy, automatic versioning, manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.

* GPU support in building vector index(*).

* Ecosystem integrations with [LangChain 🦜️🔗](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/lancedb/), [LlamaIndex 🦙](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/LanceDBIndexDemo.html), Apache-Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB and more on the way.

LanceDB&#039;s core is written in Rust 🦀 and is built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lancedb/lance&quot;&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source columnar format designed for performant ML workloads.

## Quick Start

**Javascript**
```shell
npm install @lancedb/lancedb
```

```javascript
import * as lancedb from &quot;@lancedb/lancedb&quot;;

const db = await lancedb.connect(&quot;data/sample-lancedb&quot;);
const table = await db.createTable(&quot;vectors&quot;, [
	{ id: 1, vector: [0.1, 0.2], item: &quot;foo&quot;, price: 10 },
	{ id: 2, vector: [1.1, 1.2], item: &quot;bar&quot;, price: 50 },
], {mode: &#039;overwrite&#039;});


const query = table.vectorSearch([0.1, 0.3]).limit(2);
const results = await query.toArray();

// You can also search for rows by specific criteria without involving a vector search.
const rowsByCriteria = await table.query().where(&quot;price &gt;= 10&quot;).toArray();
```

**Python**
```shell
pip install lancedb
```

```python
import lancedb

uri = &quot;data/sample-lancedb&quot;
db = lancedb.connect(uri)
table = db.create_table(&quot;my_table&quot;,
                         data=[{&quot;vector&quot;: [3.1, 4.1], &quot;item&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 10.0},
                               {&quot;vector&quot;: [5.9, 26.5], &quot;item&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 20.0}])
result = table.search([100, 100]).limit(2).to_pandas()
```

# Rayhunter

![Tests](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/actions/workflows/check-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

Rayhunter is an IMSI Catcher Catcher for the Orbic mobile hotspot.

**THIS CODE IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON IN HIGH RISK SITUATIONS!**

## The Hardware

Rayhunter has been built and tested for the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot. It may
work on other Orbics and other Linux/Qualcom devices, but this is the only one
we have tested on. You can buy the orbic [using bezos
bucks](https://www.amazon.com/Orbic-Verizon-Hotspot-Connect-Enabled/dp/B08N3CHC4Y),
or on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=orbic+rc400l). Please ensure
that the [Orbic works in your country](#orbic) before buying.

## Setup (macOS, Linux)

1. Download the latest `release.tar` from the [Rayhunter releases page](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/releases)
2. Decompress the `release.tar` archive. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/Downloads/release
    tar -xvf ~/Downloads/release.tar -C ~/Downloads/release
    cd ~/Downloads/release
    ```

3. Turn on the Orbic device by holding the power button for 3 seconds. Plug it into your computer using a USB-C Cable.
4. Run the install script for your operating system:

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The device will restart multiple times over the next few minutes.

    You will know it is done when you see terminal output that says `checking for rayhunter server...success!`

5. Rayhunter should now be running! You can verify this by following the instructions below to [view the web UI](#usage-viewing-the-web-ui). You should also see a green line flash along the top of top the display on the device.

### Installation Notes

* Note: If you are installing from the cloned GitHub repository please see the development instructions below, running `install.sh` from the git tree will not work.
* The install script has only been tested for Linux on the latest version of Ubuntu. If it fails you will need to follow the install steps outlined in **Development** below.
* On macOS if you encounter an error that says &quot;No Orbic device found,&quot; it may because you the &quot;Allow accessories to connect&quot; security setting set to &quot;Ask for approval.&quot; You may need to temporarily change it to &quot;Always&quot; for the script to run. Make sure to change it back to a more secure setting when you&#039;re done.

## Setup (Windows)

* **Windows:** We don&#039;t currently support automated installs on Windows, you will have to follow the instructions in the **Development** section below.

## Updating Rayhunter

Great news: if you&#039;ve successfully installed rayhunter, you already know how to update it! Our update process is identical to the setup process: simply download the latest release and follow the steps in the [setup section](#setup-macos-linux).

## Using Rayhunter

Once installed, Rayhunter will run automatically whenever your Orbic device is running. You&#039;ll see a green line on top of the device&#039;s display to indicate that it&#039;s running and recording. [The line will turn red](#red) once a potential IMSI catcher has been found, until the device is rebooted or a new recording is started through the web UI.

It also serves a web UI that provides some basic controls, such as being able to start/stop recordings, download captures, and view heuristic analyses of captures.

You can access this UI in one of two ways:

1. **Connect over wifi:** Connect your phone/laptop to the Orbic&#039;s 2.4GHz wifi network and visit [http://192.168.1.1:8080](http://192.168.1.1:8080). (Click past your browser warning you about the connection not being secure, Rayhunter doesn&#039;t have HTTPS yet).
    * You can find the wifi network password by going to the Orbic&#039;s menu &gt; 2.4 GHz WIFI Info &gt; Enter &gt; find the 8-character password next to the lock 🔒 icon.
2. **Connect over USB:** Connect the Orbic device to your laptop via USB. Run `adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080`, then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
    * For this you will need to install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your computer, you can copy the version that was downloaded inside the `releases/platform-tools/` folder to somewhere else in your path or you can install it manually.
    * You can find instructions for doing so on your platform [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/#how-to-set-up-adb-on-your-computer), (don&#039;t worry about instructions for installing it on a phone/device yet).
    * On macOS, the easiest way to install ADB is with Homebrew: First [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run `brew install android-platform-tools`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an active SIM card to use Rayhunter?

**It Depends**. Operation of Rayhunter does require the insertion of a SIM card into the device, but whether that SIM card has to be currently active for our tests to work is still under investigation. If you want to use the device as a hotspot in addition to a research device an active plan would of course be necessary, however we have not done enough testing yet to know whether an active subscription is required for detection. If you want to test the device with an inactive SIM card, we would certainly be interested in seeing any data you collect, and especially any runs that trigger an alert!

&lt;a name=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Help, Rayhunter&#039;s line is red! What should I do?

Unfortunately, the circumstances that might lead to a positive cell site simulator (CSS) signal are quite varied, so we don&#039;t have a universal recommendation for how to deal with the a positive signal. Depending on your circumstances and threat model, you may want to turn off your phone until you are out of the area (or put it on airplane mode) and tell your friends to do the same!

If you&#039;ve received a Rayhunter warning and would like to help us with our research, please send your Rayhunter data captures (QMDL and PCAP logs) to us at our [Signal](https://signal.org/) username [**ElectronicFrontierFoundation.90**](https://signal.me/#eu/HZbPPED5LyMkbTxJsG2PtWc2TXxPUR1OxBMcJGLOPeeCDGPuaTpOi5cfGRY6RrGf) with the following information: capture date, capture location, device, device model, and Rayhunter version. If you&#039;re unfamiliar with Signal, feel free to check out our [Security Self Defense guide on it](https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal).

Please note that this file may contain sensitive information such as your IMSI and the unique IDs of cell towers you were near which could be used to ascertain your location at the time.

&lt;a name=&quot;orbic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Does Rayhunter work outside of the US, or on any other devices besides the Orbic RC400L?

**Maybe**. Rayhunter currently only supports the Orbic RC400L, which itself only works in the US and some other countries. [Please check](https://www.frequencycheck.com/countries/) whether the Orbic RC400L supports the right frequency bands for your purpose before buying.

Orbic RC400L Supported Bands
| Frequency | Band          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5G (wideband,midband,nationwide)  | n260/n261, n77, n2/5/48/66 | 
| 4G |    2/4/5/12/13/48/66       |
| Global &amp; Roaming | n257/n78     |
| Wifi 2.4Ghz | b/g/n |
| Wifi 5Ghz | a/ac/ax |
| Wifi 6 | :white_check_mark: |

We have not tested Rayhunter on any other hardware but we would love to expand the supported platforms. We will consider giving official support to any hardware platform that can be bought for around $20-30USD. The Rayhunter daemon should theoretically work on any Linux/Android device that has a qualcomm chip with a `/dev/diag` interface and root access, though our installer script has only been tested with an Orbic. If you get it working on another device, please let us know!

There is work underway to support [TP-Link M7350](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/issues/186) to support more frequency bands and therefore support most of Europe.

### Should I get a locked or unlocked orbic device? What is the difference?

If you want to use a non-Verizon SIM card you will probably need an unlocked device. But it&#039;s not clear how locked the locked devices are nor how to unlock them, we welcome any experimentation and information regarding the use of unlocked devices.

### How do I delete capture files from the Rayhunter device?

You can get a shell on the device by inputting `adb shell` to a terminal with the device connected, you can check if it is detected with `adb devices`.
The capture files are located at */data/rayhunter/qmdl* but you will need root access to modify or delete them. From the adb shell run `/bin/rootshell` and you can now use commands like &#039;rm&#039; as root to modify and delete entries in the */data/rayhunter/qmdl* directory. **Be careful not to delete important files in other directories as you may seriously damage the device**

## Building Rayhunter from source

Building Rayhunter from source, either for development or because the install script doesn&#039;t work on your system, involves a number of external dependencies. Unless you need to do this, we recommend you use our [compiled builds](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/releases).

* Install [nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), which is required to build Rayhunter&#039;s web UI
  * Make sure to build the site with `cd bin/web &amp;&amp; npm run build` before building Rayhunter. If you&#039;re working directly on the frontend, `npm run dev` will allow you to test a local frontend with hot-reloading (use `http://localhost:5173` instead of `http://localhost:8080`).
* Install ADB on your computer using the instructions above, and make sure it&#039;s in your terminal&#039;s PATH
  * You can verify if ADB is in your PATH by running `which adb` in a terminal. If it prints the filepath to where ADB is installed, you&#039;re set! Otherwise, try following one of these guides:
    * [linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/652936/adding-android-sdk-platform-tools-to-path-downloaded-from-umake)
    * [macOS](https://www.repeato.app/setting-up-adb-on-macos-a-step-by-step-guide/)
    * [Windows](https://medium.com/@yadav-ajay/a-step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-adb-path-on-windows-0b833faebf18)
* Install `curl` on your computer to run the install scripts. It is not needed to build binaries.

### Install Rust targets

[Install Rust the usual way](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then,

- install the cross-compilation target for the device rayhunter will run on:
```sh
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
```

- install the statically compiled target for your host machine to build the binary installer [`serial`](./serial).
```sh
# check which toolchain you have installed by default with
rustup show
# now install the correct variant for your host platform, one of:
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

Now you can root your device and install Rayhunter by running `./tools/install-dev.sh`

### If you&#039;re on Windows or can&#039;t run the install scripts

* Root your device on Windows using the instructions here: &lt;https://xdaforums.com/t/resetting-verizon-orbic-speed-rc400l-firmware-flash-kajeet.4334899/#post-87855183&gt;

* Build the web UI using `cd bin/web &amp;&amp; npm run build`

* Push the scripts in `scripts/` to `/etc/init.d` on device and make a directory called `/data/rayhunter` using `adb shell` (and sshell for your root shell if you followed the steps above)

* You also need to copy `config.toml.example` to `/data/rayhunter/config.toml`

* Then run `./make.sh`, which will build the binary, push it over adb, and restart the device. Once it&#039;s restarted, Rayhunter should be running!

# The Noir Programming Language

Noir is a Domain Specific Language for SNARK proving systems. It has been designed to use any ACIR compatible proving system.

**This implementation is in early development. It has not been reviewed or audited. It is not suitable to be used in production. Expect bugs!**

## Quick Start

Read the [installation section][Getting started] from the [Noir docs][Documentation].

Once you have read through the documentation, you can visit [Awesome Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/awesome-noir) to run some of the examples that others have created.
