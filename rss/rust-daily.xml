&lt;a href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay&#039;s new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure.

Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:

* [Hyperswitch Backend](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch): Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.

* [SDK (Frontend)](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web): The SDK, available for web, [Android, and iOS](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-client-core), unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user&#039;s saved payment methods.    

* [Control Center](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-control-center): The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.

&lt;/a&gt;

### 1. Local Setup

You can run Hyperswitch on your system using Docker compose after cloning this repository. 
We recommend using Docker Desktop (Or Orbstack) for Windows and Mac OS. On Linux, you can install Docker Engine directly.
```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch
cd hyperswitch
docker compose up -d
# This script verifies the setup and provides links to the individual components.
scripts/docker_output.sh
```
The next step is to [configure a connector][configure-a-connector] with the Hyperswitch Control Center and [try a payment][try-a-payment].

Check out the [local setup guide][local-setup-guide] for more details on setting up the entire stack or component wise.


### 2. Deployment on cloud

**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on &lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** 👇

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion 💥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ❤️‍🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks 🦞
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voilà_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management 🦀
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection 🎯
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension 🎒
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/burn-book/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book 🔥
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;


Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Supported Backends**

| Backend  | Devices                      | Class       |
| -------  | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| CUDA     | NVIDIA GPUs                  | First-Party |
| ROCm     | AMD GPUs                     | First-Party |
| Metal    | Apple GPUs                   | First-Party |
| Vulkan   | Most GPUs on Linux &amp; Windows | First-Party |
| Wgpu     | Most GPUs                    | First-Party |
| NdArray  | Most CPUs                    | Third-Party |
| LibTorch | Most GPUs &amp; CPUs             | Third-Party |
| Candle   | Nvidia, Apple GPUs &amp; CPUs    | Third-Party |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server.
The client sends tensor operations over the network to a remote compute backend.
You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand 👇**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard 📈
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support 🐫
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch Models 🚚
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Support for loading of PyTorch model weights into Burn’s native model architecture, ensuring
seamless integration. See
[Burn Book 🔥 section on importing PyTorch](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/pytorch-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser 🌐
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2️⃣ 7️⃣ 😰
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! 🌄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ⚙️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).


&gt; ⚠️ **Warning**  
&gt; When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency chain.  
&gt; To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.


## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-walking.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/burn-book/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests 😄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples 🙏
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
        let x = self.linear_inner.forward(input);
        let x = self.gelu.forward(x);
        let x = self.dropout.forward(x);

        self.linear_outer.forward(x)
    }
}
```

We have a somewhat large amount of [examples](./examples) in the repository that shows how to use
the framework in diffe

_presenterm_ lets you create presentations in markdown format and run them from your terminal, with support for image 
and animated gifs, highly customizable themes, code highlighting, exporting presentations into PDF format, and plenty of 
other features. This is how the [demo presentation](/examples/demo.md) looks like when running in the [kitty 
terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/):

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

OpenDAL (`/ˈoʊ.pən.dæl/`, pronounced &quot;OH-puhn-dal&quot;) is an Open Data Access Layer that enables seamless interaction with diverse storage services.

OpenDAL&#039;s development is guided by its vision of **One Layer, All Storage** and its core principles: **Open Community**, **Solid Foundation**, **Fast Access**, **Object Storage First**, and **Extensible Architecture**. Read the explained vision at [OpenDAL Vision](https://opendal.apache.org/vision).

| [conda-forge]   | `conda install -c conda-forge starship` |
| [Homebrew]      | `brew install starship`                 |
| [MacPorts]      | `port install starship`                 |

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Windows&lt;/summary&gt;

Install the latest version for your system with the MSI-installers from the [releases section](https://github.com/starship/starship/releases/latest).

Install Starship using any of the following package managers:

| Repository      | Instructions                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **[crates.io]** | `cargo install starship --locked`       |
| [Chocolatey]    | `choco install starship`                |
| [conda-forge]   | `conda install -c conda-forge starship` |
| [Scoop]         | `scoop install starship`                |
| [winget]        | `winget install --id Starship.Starship` |

&lt;/details&gt;

### Step 2. Set up your shell to use Starship

Configure your shell to initialize starship. Select yours from the list below:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Bash&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init bash)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cmd&lt;/summary&gt;

You need to use [Clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html) (v1.2.30+) with Cmd.
Create a file at this path `%LocalAppData%\clink\starship.lua` with the following contents:

```lua
load(io.popen(&#039;starship init cmd&#039;):read(&quot;*a&quot;))()
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Elvish&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```sh
eval (starship init elvish)
```

Note: Only Elvish v0.18+ is supported

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Fish&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
starship init fish | source
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Ion&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/ion/initrc`:

```sh
eval $(starship init ion)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Nushell&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of your Nushell configuration (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```sh
mkdir ($nu.data-dir | path join &quot;vendor/autoload&quot;)
starship init nu | save -f ($nu.data-dir | path join &quot;vendor/autoload/starship.nu&quot;)
```

Note: Only Nushell v0.96+ is supported

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;PowerShell&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of your PowerShell configuration (find it by running `$PROFILE`):

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&amp;starship init powershell)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tcsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.tcshrc`:

```sh
eval `starship init tcsh`
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Xonsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.xonshrc`:

```python
execx($(starship init xonsh))
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Zsh&lt;/summary&gt;

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
eval &quot;$(starship init zsh)&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Step 3. Configure Starship

Start a new shell instance, and you should see your beautiful new shell prompt.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># libc - Raw FFI bindings to platforms&#039; system libraries

[![GHA Status]][GitHub Actions] [![Cirrus CI Status]][Cirrus CI] [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![Documentation]][docs.rs] ![License]

`libc` provides all of the definitions necessary to easily interoperate with C
code (or &quot;C-like&quot; code) on each of the platforms that Rust supports. This
includes type definitions (e.g. `c_int`), constants (e.g. `EINVAL`) as well as
function headers (e.g. `malloc`).

This crate exports all underlying platform types, functions, and constants under
the crate root, so all items are accessible as `libc::foo`. The types and values
of all the exported APIs match the platform that libc is compiled for.

Windows API bindings are not included in this crate. If you are looking for
WinAPI bindings, consider using crates like [windows-sys].

More detailed information about the design of this library can be found in its
[associated RFC][rfc].

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/HEAD/text/1291-promote-libc.md
[windows-sys]: https://docs.rs/windows-sys

## v1.0 Roadmap

Currently, `libc` has two active branches: `main` for the upcoming v1.0 release,
and `libc-0.2` for the currently published version. By default all pull requests
should target `main`; once reviewed, they can be cherry picked to the `libc-0.2`
branch if needed.

We will stop making new v0.2 releases once v1.0 is released.

See the section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#v10-roadmap) for more
details.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = &quot;0.2&quot;
```

## Features

* `std`: by default `libc` links to the standard library. Disable this feature
  to remove this dependency and be able to use `libc` in `#![no_std]` crates.

* `extra_traits`: all `struct`s implemented in `libc` are `Copy` and `Clone`.
  This feature derives `Debug`, `Eq`, `Hash`, and `PartialEq`.

## Rust version support

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently **Rust 1.63**.

Increases to the MSRV are allowed to change without a major (i.e. semver-
breaking) release in order to avoid a ripple effect in the ecosystem. A policy
for when this may change is a work in progress.

`libc` may continue to compile with Rust versions older than the current MSRV
but this is not guaranteed.

## Platform support

You can see the platform(target)-specific docs on [docs.rs], select a platform
you want to see.

See [`ci/verify-build.sh`](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/HEAD/ci/verify-build.sh) for
the platforms on which `libc` is guaranteed to build for each Rust toolchain.
The test-matrix at [GitHub Actions] and [Cirrus CI] show the platforms in which
`libc` tests are run.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Embassy

Embassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.

## &lt;a href=&quot;https://embassy.dev/book/index.html&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/&quot;&gt;API reference&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://embassy.dev/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;/a&gt;
## Rust + async ❤️ embedded

The Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system. 

Rust&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/a&gt; allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation, and runs on a single stack,  so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown&quot;&gt;faster and smaller than one!&lt;/a&gt;

## Batteries included

- **Hardware Abstraction Layers** - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/&quot;&gt;embassy-stm32&lt;/a&gt;, for all STM32 microcontroller families.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/&quot;&gt;embassy-nrf&lt;/a&gt;, for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF54 and nRF91 series.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/&quot;&gt;embassy-rp&lt;/a&gt;, for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP23xx microcontrollers.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-mspm0/&quot;&gt;embassy-mspm0&lt;/a&gt;, for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 microcontrollers.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/esp-rs&quot;&gt;esp-rs&lt;/a&gt;, for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.
    - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips, as well as Async WiFi, Bluetooth and ESP-NOW,  is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal&quot;&gt;ch32-hal&lt;/a&gt;, for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AlexCharlton/mpfs-hal&quot;&gt;mpfs-hal&lt;/a&gt;, for the Microchip PolarFire SoC.
  - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-hal&quot;&gt;py32-hal&lt;/a&gt;, for the Puya Semiconductor PY32 series of microcontrollers.

- **Time that Just Works** - 
No more messing with hardware timers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time&quot;&gt;embassy_time&lt;/a&gt; provides Instant, Duration and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.

- **Real-time ready** - 
Tasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities, so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.

- **Low-power ready** - 
Easily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there&#039;s no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.
 
- **Networking** - 
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/&quot;&gt;embassy-net&lt;/a&gt; network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.

- **Bluetooth**
  - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble&quot;&gt;trouble&lt;/a&gt; crate provides a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x Host that runs on any microcontroller implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/bt-hci&quot;&gt;bt-hci&lt;/a&gt; traits (currently `nRF52`, `rp2040`, `rp23xx` and `esp32` and `serial` controllers are supported).
  - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice&quot;&gt;nrf-softdevice&lt;/a&gt; crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.
  - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan&quot;&gt;embassy-stm32-wpan&lt;/a&gt; crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.

- **LoRa** - The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs&quot;&gt;lora-rs&lt;/a&gt; project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.

- **USB** - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/&quot;&gt;embassy-usb&lt;/a&gt; implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.

- **Bootloader and DFU** - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot&quot;&gt;embassy-boot&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.


## Sneak peek

```rust,ignore
use defmt::info;
use embassy_executor::Spawner;
use embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};
use embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, Level, Output, OutputDrive, Pin, Pull};
use embassy_nrf::{Peri, Peripherals};

// Declare async tasks
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn blink(pin: Peri&lt;&#039;static, AnyPin&gt;) {
    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);

    loop {
        // Timekeeping is globally available, no need to mess with hardware timers.
        led.set_high();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
        led.set_low();
        Timer::after_millis(150).await;
    }
}

// Main is itself an async task as well.
#[embassy_executor::main]
async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());

    // Spawned tasks run in the background, concurrently.
    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_13.into())).unwrap();

    let mut button = Input::new(p.P0_11, Pull::Up);
    loop {
        // Asynchronously wait for GPIO events, allowing other tasks
        // to run, or the core to sleep.
        button.wait_for_low().await;
        info!(&quot;Button pressed!&quot;);
        button.wait_for_high().await;
        info!(&quot;Button released!&quot;);
    }
}
```

## Examples

Examples are found in the `examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:

*   `examples/nrf52840` run on the `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.
*   `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).
*   `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.
*   `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.
*   `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.

### Running examples

- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at &lt;https://probe.rs&gt;.
- Change directory to the sample&#039;s base directory. For example:

```bash
cd examples/nrf52840
```

- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.
  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash
  after being programmed.

- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.

- Run the example

For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin blinky
```

For more help getting started, see [Getting Started][1] and [Running the Examples][2].

## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer based editors

The [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer
must be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,
please refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file&#039;s `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

Embassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

## Why the name?

EMBedded ASYnc! :)

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [📖 Foundry Book][foundry-book]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[⠒] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[⠊] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge][foundry-book-forge] section of the Foundry Book.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast][foundry-book-cast] section of the Foundry Book.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil][foundry-book-anvil] section of the Foundry Book.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
➜ uint256 a = 123;
➜ a
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x7b
├ Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
└ Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel][foundry-book-chisel] section of the Foundry Book.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides][foundry-book-config] in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

- [Configuring with `foundry.toml`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/)

- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.4.12 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-04-29)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ✓ installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

## 🚀 Start Contributing

### Prerequisites

- MacOS
  - Xcode 13 or later
  - Brew

### 1. Clone repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-for-command-line.git
```

### 2. Setup
Hassle-free setup:
```shell
npm run setup
```

Or if you&#039;d like to DIY:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Manual Setup&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

### 1. Install platform dependencies

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config jq dpkg curl wget cmake clang libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev valac libibus-1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev sqlite3 libxdo-dev protobuf-compiler
```
### 2. Install Rust toolchain using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs):

```shell
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
```

For pre-commit hooks, the following commands are required:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install typos-cli
```

For MacOS development make sure the right targets are installed:

```shell
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### 3. Setup Python and Node using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Add mise integrations to your shell:

For zsh:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; &quot;${ZDOTDIR-$HOME}/.zshrc&quot;
```

For bash:
```shell
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
```

For fish:
```shell
echo &#039;mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Install the Python and Node toolchains using:

```shell
mise trust
mise install
```

### 4. Setup precommit hooks

Run `pnpm` in root directory to add pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;


### 3. Start Local Development
To compile and view changes made to `q chat`:
```shell
cargo run --bin q_cli -- chat
```

&gt; If you are working on other q commands, just replace `chat` with the command name 

To run tests for the Q CLI crate:
```shell
cargo test -p q_cli
```

To format Rust files:
```shell
cargo +nightly fmt
```

To run clippy:
```shell
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --color always -- -D warnings
```



### 💡 Quick Tip for Onboarding

Use Q CLI to help you onboard Q CLI! 

Start a `q chat` session:

```shell
q chat
```

Once inside `q chat`, you can supply project context by adding the [`codebase-summary.md`](codebase-summary.md) file:

```shell
/context add codebase-summary.md
```

This enables Q to answer onboarding questions like:

- “What does this crate do?”

- “Where is X implemented?”

- “How do these components interact?”

Great for speeding up your ramp-up and navigating the repo more effectively.

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) is a framework providing several convenient developer tools for writing Solana programs (sometimes called &#039;smart contracts&#039;).

- Rust eDSL for writing Solana programs
- [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification
- TypeScript package for generating clients from IDL
- CLI and workspace management for developing complete applications

Anchor is the most popular framework for Solana programs.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re familiar with developing in Ethereum&#039;s [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), then using Anchor be familiar. Although the DSL syntax and semantics are targeted at Solana, the high level flow of writing RPC request handlers, emitting an IDL, and generating clients from IDL is the same.

## Examples

Here&#039;s a counter program, where only the designated `authority`
can increment the count.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!(&quot;Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS&quot;);

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context&lt;Initialize&gt;, start: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context&lt;Increment&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let counter = &amp;mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
    pub system_program: Program&lt;&#039;info, System&gt;,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment&lt;&#039;info&gt; {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account&lt;&#039;info, Counter&gt;,
    pub authority: Signer&lt;&#039;info&gt;,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

## Overview

_komorebi_ is a tiling window manager that works as an extension to Microsoft&#039;s
[Desktop Window
Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview) in
Windows 10 and above.

_komorebi_ allows you to control application windows, virtual workspaces and display monitors with a CLI which can be
used with third-party software such as [`whkd`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/whkd)
and [AutoHotKey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) to set user-defined keyboard shortcuts.

_komorebi_ aims to make _as few modifications as possible_ to the operating
system and desktop environment by default. Users are free to make such
modifications in their own configuration files for _komorebi_, but these will
remain opt-in and off-by-default for the foreseeable future.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi) for instructions on how
to [install](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/installation.html) and
[configure](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/example-configurations.html)
_komorebi_, [common workflows](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/common-workflows/komorebi-config-home.html), a complete
[configuration schema reference](https://komorebi.lgug2z.com/schema) and a
complete [CLI reference](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/cli/quickstart.html).

## Community

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGkn66PHkx) available for
_komorebi_-related discussion, help, troubleshooting etc. If you have any
specific feature requests or bugs to report, please create an issue in this
repository.

There is a [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeai3-do-9O4MNy9_xjO6mg) where I post
_komorebi_ development videos, feature previews and release overviews. Subscribing
to the channel (which is monetized as part of the YouTube Partner Program) and
watching videos is a really simple and passive way to contribute financially to
the development and maintenance of _komorebi_.

There is an [Awesome List](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/awesome-komorebi) which
showcases the many awesome projects that exist in the _komorebi_ ecosystem.

# Installation

A [detailed installation and quickstart
guide](https://lgug2z.github.io/komorebi/installation.html) is available which shows how to get started
using `scoop`, `winget` or building from source.

[![Watch the quickstart walkthrough video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MMZUAtHbTYY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMZUAtHbTYY)

# Comparison With Fancy Zones

Community member [Olge](https://www.youtube.com/@polle5555) has created an
excellent video which compares the default window management features of
Windows 11, Fancy Zones and komorebi.

If you are not familiar with tiling window managers or if you are looking at
komorebi and wondering &quot;how is this different from Fancy Zones? 🤔&quot;, this short
video will answer the majority of your questions.

# Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to contribute to `komorebi` please take the time to carefully
read the guidelines below.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how
code contributions to `komorebi` are licensed.

## Commit hygiene

- Flatten all `use` statements
- Run `cargo +stable clippy` and ensure that all lints and suggestions have been addressed before committing
- Run `cargo +nightly fmt --all` to ensure consistent formatting before committing
- Use `git cz` with
  the [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#conventional-commit-messages-as-a-global-utility) to prepare
  commit messages
- Provide **at least** one short sentence or paragraph in your commit message body to describe your thought process for
  the changes being committed

## PRs should contain only a single feature or bug fix

It is very difficult to review pull requests which touch multiple unrelated features and parts of the codebase.

Please do not submit pull requests like this; you will be asked to separate them into smaller PRs that deal only with
one feature or bug fix at a time.

If you are working on multiple features and bug fixes, I suggest that you cut a branch called `local-trunk`
from `master` which you keep up to date, and rebase the various independent branches you are working on onto that branch
if you want to test them together or create a build with everything integrated.

## Refactors to the codebase must have prior approval

`komorebi` is a mature codebase with an internal consistency and structure that has developed organically over close to
half a decade.

There are [countless hours of live coding videos](https://youtube.com/@LGUG2Z) demonstrating work on this project and
showing new contributors how to do everything from basic tasks like implementing new `komorebic` commands to
distinguishing monitors by manufacturer hardware identifiers and video card ports.

Refactors to the structure of the codebase are not taken lightly and require prior discussion and approval.

Please do not start refactoring the codebase with the expectation of having your changes integrated until you receive an
explicit approval or a request to do so.

Similarly, when implementing features and bug fixes, please stick to the structure of the codebase as much as possible
and do not take this as an opportunity to do some &quot;refactoring along the way&quot;.

It is extremely difficult to review PRs for features and bug fixes if they are lost in sweeping changes to the structure
of the codebase.

## Breaking changes to user-facing interfaces are unacceptable

This includes but is not limited to:

- All `komorebic` commands
- The `komorebi.json` schema
- The [
  `komorebi-application-specific-configuration`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-application-specific-configuration)
  schema

No user should ever find that their configuration file has stopped working after upgrading to a new version
of `komorebi`.

More often than not there are ways to reformulate changes that may initially seem like they require breaking user-facing
interfaces into additive changes.

For some inspiration please take a look
at [this commit](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/e7d928a065eb63bb4ea1fb864c69c1cae8cc763b) which added the
ability for users to specify colours in `komorebi.json` in Hex format alongside RGB.

There is also a process in place for graceful, non-breaking, deprecation of configuration options that are no longer
required.

# Development

If you use IntelliJ, you should enable the following settings to ensure that code generated by macros is recognised by
the IDE for completions and navigation:

- Set `Expand declarative macros`
  to `Use new engine` under &quot;Settings &gt; Langauges &amp; Frameworks &gt; Rust&quot;
- Enable the following experimental features:
    - `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts`
    - `org.rust.macros.proc`

# Logs and Debugging

Logs from `komorebi` will be appended to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/komorebi/komorebi.log`; this file is never rotated or
overwritten, so it will keep growing until it is deleted by the user.

Whenever running the `komorebic stop` command or sending a Ctrl-C signal to `komorebi` directly, the `komorebi` process
ensures that all hidden windows are restored before termination.

If however, you ever end up with windows that are hidden and cannot be restored, a list of window handles known
to `komorebi` are stored and continuously updated in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/komorebi//komorebi.hwnd.json`.

## Restoring Windows

Running `komorebic restore-windows` will read the list of window handles and forcibly restore them, regardless of
whether the main `komorebi` process is running.

## Panics and Deadlocks

If `komorebi` ever stops responding, it is most likely either due to either a panic or a deadlock. In the case of a
panic, this will be reported in the log. In the case of a deadlock, there will not be any errors in the log, but the
process and the log will appear frozen.

If you believe you have encountered a deadlock, you can compile `komorebi` with `--features deadlock_detection` and try
reproducing the deadlock again. This will check for deadlocks every 5 seconds in the background, and if a deadlock is
found, information about it will appear in the log which can be shared when opening an issue.

# Window Manager State and Integrations

The current state of the window manager can be queried using the `komorebic state` command, which returns a JSON
representation of the `State` struct.

This may also be polled to build further integrations and widgets on top of.

# Window Manager Event Subscriptions

## Named Pipes

It is possible to subscribe to notifications of every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled
by `komorebi` using [Named Pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes).

First, your application must create a named pipe. Once the named pipe has been created, run the following command:

```powershell
komorebic.exe subscribe-pipe &lt;your pipe name&gt;
```

Note that you do not have to include the full path of the named pipe, just the name.

If the named pipe exists, `komorebi` will start pushing JSON data of successfully handled events and messages:

```json lines

{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;FocusChange&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;SystemForeground&quot;,{&quot;hwnd&quot;:132968,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Windows PowerShell&quot;,&quot;exe&quot;:&quot;WindowsTerminal.exe&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS&quot;,&quot;rect&quot;:{&quot;left&quot;:1539,&quot;top&quot;:60,&quot;right&quot;:1520,&quot;bottom&quot;:821}}]},&quot;state&quot;:{}}
```

You may then filter on the `type` key to listen to the events that you are interested in. For a full list of possible
notification types, refer to the enum variants of `WindowManagerEvent` in `komorebi` and `SocketMessage`
in `komorebi::core`.

Below is an example of how you can subscribe to and filter on events using a named pipe in `nodejs`.

```javascript
const { exec } = require(&quot;child_process&quot;);
const net = require(&quot;net&quot;);

const pipeName = &quot;\\\\.\\pipe\\komorebi-js&quot;;
const server = net.createServer((stream) =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Client connected&quot;);

  // Every time there is a workspace-related event, let&#039;s log the names of all
  // workspaces on the currently focused monitor, and then log the name of the
  // currently focused workspace on that monitor

  stream.on(&quot;data&quot;, (data) =&gt; {
    let json = JSON.parse(data.toString());
    let event = json.event;

    if (event.type.includes(&quot;Workspace&quot;)) {
      let monitors = json.state.monitors;
      let current_monitor = monitors.elements[monitors.focused];
      let workspaces = monitors.elements[monitors.focused].workspaces;
      let current_workspace = workspaces.elements[workspaces.focused];

      console.log(
        workspaces.elements
          .map((workspace) =&gt; workspace.name)
          .filter((name) =&gt; name !== null)
      );
      console.log(current_workspace.name);
    }
  });

  stream.on(&quot;end&quot;, () =&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Client disconnected&quot;);
  });
});

server.listen(pipeName, () =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Named pipe server listening&quot;);
});

const command = &quot;komorebic subscribe-pipe komorebi-js&quot;;

exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) =&gt; {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error executing command: ${error}`);
    return;
  }
});
```

## Unix Domain Sockets

It is possible to subscribe to notifications of every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled
by `komorebi` using [Unix Domain Sockets](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/).

UDS are also the only mode of communication between `komorebi` and `komorebic`.

First, your application must create a socket in `$ENV:LocalAppData\komorebi`. Once the socket has been created, run the
following command:

```powershell
komorebic.exe subscribe-socket &lt;your socket name&gt;
```

If the socket exists, komorebi will start pushing JSON data of successfully handled events and messages as in the
example above in the Named Pipes section.

## Rust Client

As of `v0.1.22` it is possible to use the `komorebi-client` crate to subscribe to notifications of
every `WindowManagerEvent` and `SocketMessage` handled by `komorebi` in a Rust codebase.

Below is a simple example of how to use `komorebi-client` in a basic Rust application.

```rust
// komorebi-client = { git = &quot;https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi&quot;, tag = &quot;v0.1.36&quot;}

use anyhow::Result;
use komorebi_client::Notification;
use komorebi_client::NotificationEvent;
use komorebi_client::UnixListener;
use komorebi_client::WindowManagerEvent;
use std::io::BufRead;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::io::Read;

pub fn main() -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {
  let socket = komorebi_client::subscribe(NAME)?;

  for incoming in socket.incoming() {
    match incoming {
      Ok(data) =&gt; {
        let reader = BufReader::new(data.try_clone()?);

        for line in reader.lines().flatten() {
          let notification: Notification = match serde_json::from_str(&amp;line) {
            Ok(notification) =&gt; notification,
            Err(error) =&gt; {
              log::debug!(&quot;discarding malformed komorebi notification: {error}&quot;);
              continue;
            }
          };

          // match and filter on desired notifications
        }
      }
      Err(error) =&gt; {
        log::debug!(&quot;{error}&quot;);
      }
    }
  }

}
```

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 30TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 100 contributors** and growing.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Walrus

A decentralized blob store using [Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) for coordination and
governance.

## Documentation

Our main documentation is available [as a Walrus Site](https://docs.wal.app) (see [the
documentation](https://docs.wal.app/walrus-sites/intro.html) for further information on what
this means) and on [GitHub Pages](https://mystenlabs.github.io/walrus); it is generated using
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) from source files in the [`docs/book`](./docs/book)
directory.

You can also build the documentation locally (assuming you have Rust installed):

```sh
cargo install mdbook mdbook-admonish mdbook-katex mdbook-linkcheck mdbook-tabs mdbook-templates --locked
mdbook serve
```

After this, you can browse the documentation at &lt;http://localhost:3000&gt;.

There are some additional documentation resources:

- Usage examples are available under [docs/examples](./docs/examples/).
- Our encoding system, which we call *Red Stuff*, is described in detail in
  [docs/red-stuff.md](docs/red-stuff.md).
- All our code is covered by Rust docs. You can build these and open them in your web browser by
  running the following:

  ```sh
  cargo doc --workspace --open # add `--no-deps` to prevent building docs of all dependencies
  ```

## Repository structure

This repository contains all Walrus-related code, tools, and documentation:

- [`contracts`](./contracts) contains all smart contracts used by Walrus for coordination and governance.
- [`crates`](./crates) contains all Rust crates related to Walrus including binaries for storage nodes
  and clients. See [below](#rust-crates) for further information about those.
- [`docker`](./docker) contains Dockerfiles and docker-compose setups for building and running Walrus.
- [`docs`](./docs) contains high-level technical and design documentation about Walrus.
- [`scripts`](./scripts) contains tools used for evaluating and testing the code. In particular, this
  contains a script to run a local testbed, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#run-a-local-walrus-testbed).
- [`setup`](./setup) contains setup scripts and configuration files.
- [`testnet-contracts`](./testnet-contracts) contains the Walrus contracts deployed for Walrus
  Testnet. The object IDs of the published contracts are included in the `Move.lock` files.

### Rust crates

Our Rust code is split into several crates with different responsibilities. The main code for Walrus
is contained in the following crates:

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable proper-names --&gt;
- [walrus-core](crates/walrus-core/) contains core types and functionality, including encoding and
  authentication mechanisms.
- [walrus-rest-client](crates/walrus-rest-client/) contains (client) interactions with storage nodes.
- [walrus-service](crates/walrus-service/) contains client and server functionality including the
  storage backend. This crate also contains all main binaries, in particular `walrus` and
  `walrus-node`.
- [walrus-sui](crates/walrus-sui/) contains all types and interactions with the Sui smart contracts.
- [walrus-utils](crates/walrus-utils/) contains utility functions used in multiple crates.

The following crates contain additional tools that are not part of the main functionality of Walrus
and more extensive tests:

- [checkpoint-downloader](crates/checkpoint-downloader/) contains code to download checkpoints from
  Sui RPC nodes and checkpoint buckets.
- [walrus-e2e-tests](crates/walrus-e2e-tests/) contains end-to-end tests, some of which are also
  run as simulation tests.
- [walrus-orchestrator](crates/walrus-orchestrator/) contains tools to deploy and benchmark
  distributed Walrus networks. This crate is not a default member of the workspace and therefore
  needs to be built explicitly by adding `-p walrus-orchestrator` or `--workspace` to the cargo
  commands.
- [walrus-proc-macros](crates/walrus-proc-macros/) contains procedural macros used in the other
  crates, notably to define simulation tests.
- [walrus-proxy](crates/walrus-proxy/) contains a metrics proxy that authenticates storage nodes and
  collects metrics from them. This crate is not a default member of the workspace and therefore
  needs to be built explicitly by adding `-p walrus-proxy` or `--workspace` to the cargo commands.
- [walrus-simtest](crates/walrus-simtest/) contains simulation tests to ensure that Walrus works
  correctly for all interleavings of concurrent operations and in the presence of crashes.
- [walrus-stress](crates/walrus-stress/) contains a stress client, which is used to put load on
  storage nodes and perform randomized staking re-assignments.
- [walrus-test-utils](crates/walrus-test-utils/) contains test macros and other utilities used in
  the other crates.
&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable proper-names --&gt;

## Using the Walrus client

If you just want to use the Walrus Mainnet or Testnet, please follow the [setup instructions in our
documentation](https://docs.wal.app/usage/setup.html). Further information about the usage is
also available in the [public documentation](https://docs.wal.app/usage/interacting.html).

If you want to build the binary from source or run local tests, see the instructions
[below](#building-from-source-and-testing).

## Hardware requirements

- We assume that this code is executed on at least 32-bit hardware; concretely, we assume that a
  `u32` can be converted safely into a `usize`.
- Servers are assumed to use a 64-bit architecture (or higher); concretely, `usize` has at least 64
  bits.
- Our encoding relies on vector instructions to be efficient. Our default builds assume AVX2 and
  SSSE3 support on x86 CPUs and Neon support on ARM CPUs. Walrus binaries can be built for CPUs
  without these features, but will be much slower.
- When a client is executed on a 32-bit architecture, it may panic for blobs above a certain size.
  Given sufficient physical memory (4 GiB), it is generally possible to encode or decode blobs
  smaller than 500 MiB on 32-bit architectures.

## Building from source and testing

To build Walrus you need to install Rust as described in the [Rust
documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and the correct Rust toolchain:

```sh
rustup update &amp;&amp; rustup toolchain install
```

Then, you can build Walrus using Cargo:

```sh
cargo build # add `--release` for optimized builds
```

You can directly run a local build of the `walrus` binary as `cargo run --bin walrus`. Arguments and
options can be specified after a `--`, for example `cargo run --bin walrus -- store README.md
--epochs 1`.

You can run our test suite by installing [nextest](https://nexte.st/), and then calling `cargo
nextest run`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#tests) for further details on our tests and
instructions on how to run a local Walrus testbed.

## Contributing

If you observe a bug or want to request a feature, please search for an existing
[issue](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/issues) on this topic and, if none exists, create a new
one. If you would like to contribute code directly (which we highly appreciate), please familiarize
yourself with our [contributing workflow](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk

Please ensure that you are running these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, otherwise the application might not be able to find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

&lt;br&gt;

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property &#039;importKey&#039;`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.
&gt;
&gt;This can be configured in [Vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a third-party reverse proxy ([some examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).
&gt;
&gt;If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let&#039;s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like Caddy or Traefik (see examples linked above).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

The main way to use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 80:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mountpoint for Amazon S3

[![Tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Integration tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, high-throughput file client for [mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/the-inside-story-on-mountpoint-for-amazon-s3-a-high-performance-open-source-file-client/). With Mountpoint for Amazon S3, your applications can access objects stored in Amazon S3 through file operations like `open` and `read`. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 automatically translates these operations into S3 object API calls, giving your applications access to the elastic storage and throughput of Amazon S3 through a file interface.

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is optimized for applications that need high read throughput to large objects, potentially from many clients at once, and to write new objects sequentially from a single client at a time. This means it&#039;s a great fit for applications that use a file interface to:
* read large objects from S3, potentially from many instances concurrently, without downloading them to local storage first
* access only some S3 objects out of a larger data set, but can&#039;t predict which objects in advance
* upload their output to S3 directly, or upload files from local storage with tools like `cp`

but probably not the right fit for applications that:
* use file operations that S3 doesn&#039;t natively support, like directory renaming or symlinks
* make edits to existing files (don&#039;t work on your Git repository or run `vim` in Mountpoint 😄)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 does not implement all the features of a POSIX file system, and there are some differences that may affect compatibility with your application. See [Mountpoint file system behavior](doc/SEMANTICS.md) for a detailed description of Mountpoint for Amazon S3&#039;s behavior and POSIX support and how they could affect your application.
To troubleshoot file operations that may not be supported by Mountpoint, see the [troubleshooting documentation](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Current status

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is generally available! We&#039;re tracking future feature development on the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/84). We&#039;re always interested in feedback on features, performance, and compatibility. Please send feedback by [opening a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new/choose) or adding your input to an existing roadmap issue.

### Notices

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Mountpoint for Amazon S3 v1.4.0, released on January 26, 2024, contains an [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/751) that causes intermittent read failures. We recommend that customers using v1.4.0 upgrade to v1.4.1 or later.

## Getting started

Run these two commands to install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 on your Amazon Linux EC2 instance (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm
    sudo yum install -y ./mount-s3.rpm

On Ubuntu, use these commands instead (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./mount-s3.deb

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Installing Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and other installation options, including the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html) for Kubernetes applications, or building from source.

Once you&#039;ve got Mountpoint for Amazon S3 installed, you can mount your Amazon S3 bucket.
You&#039;ll need valid AWS credentials to access your bucket.
Mountpoint will automatically use credentials from [an IAM role associated with your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html),
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables,
or from [several other sources](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#aws-credentials).

To mount your bucket, run this command,
replacing `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of your bucket
and `/path/to/mount` with the directory you want to mount the bucket to:

    mount-s3 amzn-s3-demo-bucket /path/to/mount

Now you can work with your bucket contents as if they were a local file system:

    ls /path/to/mount
    echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; &gt; /path/to/mount/Data.txt
    cat /path/to/mount/Data.txt

When you&#039;re finished accessing your bucket, you can unmount it (you might need `sudo`):

    umount /path/to/mount

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Configuring Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details on how to configure and use Mountpoint.

### Compatibility with other storage services

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is designed for high-performance access to the Amazon S3 service. While it may be functional against other storage services that use S3-like APIs, we aren&#039;t able to provide support for those use cases, and they may inadvertently break when we make changes to better support Amazon S3. We welcome contributions of minor compatibility fixes or performance improvements for these services if the changes can be tested against Amazon S3.

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.81 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
