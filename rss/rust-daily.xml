  &lt;i&gt;Linting the CPython codebase from scratch.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- ‚ö°Ô∏è 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- üêç Installable via `pip`
- üõ†Ô∏è `pyproject.toml` support
- ü§ù Python 3.13 compatibility
- ‚öñÔ∏è Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- üì¶ Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- üîß Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- üìè Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ‚å®Ô∏è First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors) for [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- üåé Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.12.10
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

# Welcome to Sui

[![Github release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MystenLabs/sui.svg?sort=semver)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/latest)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MystenLabs/sui)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/LICENSE)

[Sui](https://sui.io) is a next-generation smart contract platform with high throughput, low latency, and an asset-oriented programming model powered by the [Move programming language](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move).

## Sui Highlights

Sui offers the following benefits and capabilities:

 * Unmatched scalability, instant settlement
 * A safe smart contract language accessible to mainstream developers
 * Ability to define rich and composable on-chain assets
 * Better user experience for web3 apps

Sui is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost, programmability, and usability. As Sui approaches Mainnet launch, it will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems ‚Äì traditional and blockchain alike. Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Latest News

* [08/05] Deploy `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with disaggregated serving on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using Dynamo [‚û°Ô∏è link](./components/backends/trtllm/gpt-oss.md)

## The Era of Multi-GPU, Multi-Node

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models are quickly outgrowing the memory and compute budget of any single GPU. Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs‚Äîand sometimes many servers‚Äîbut it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:

- **Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference** ‚Äì Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.
- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** ‚Äì Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-aware request routing** ‚Äì Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated data transfer** ‚Äì Reduces inference response time using NIXL.
- **KV cache offloading** ‚Äì Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/images/frontpage-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dynamo architecture&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.

# Installation

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/support_matrix.md](docs/support_matrix.md)

## 1. Initial setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install etcd and NATS (required)

To coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. To run Dynamo locally, these need to be available.

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup etcd &amp; NATS, you can also run:
```
# At the root of the repository:
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 2. Select an engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, trtllm, and llama.cpp. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Running an LLM API server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** ‚Äì High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** ‚Äì Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** ‚Äì Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.
# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
python -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8080 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem]

# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,
# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --skip-tokenizer-init
```

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### Deploying Dynamo

- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.
- Check out [Backends](components/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)
- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.

# Engines

Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).

## vLLM

```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

vLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length &lt;value&gt;`.

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## SGLang

```
# Install libnuma
apt install -y libnuma-dev

uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.sglang.worker --help
```

You can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.

## TensorRT-LLM

It is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.
&gt; For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.0.0rc6`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.06`.
&gt; To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.

&gt; [!Important]
&gt; Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`

### Install prerequisites
```
# Optional step: Only required for Blackwell and Grace Hopper
uv pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Required until the trtllm version is bumped to include this pinned dependency itself
uv pip install &quot;cuda-python&gt;=12,&lt;13&quot;

sudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev
```

&gt; [!Tip]
&gt; You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).

### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo
```
uv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]
```

Run the backend/worker like this:
```
python -m dynamo.trtllm --help
```

To specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

# Developing Locally

## 1. Install libraries

**Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```
If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.


## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python virtual env:

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment
```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install build tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install the wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install .
# For development, use
export PYTHONPATH=&quot;${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/components/frontend/src:$(pwd)/components/planner/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/vllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/sglang/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/trtllm/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/llama_cpp/src:$(pwd)/components/backends/mocker/src&quot;
```

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Editable (`-e`) does not work because the `dynamo` package is split over multiple directories, one per backend.

You should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.

Remember that nats and etcd must be running (see earlier).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.

similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

__Cube is the universal semantic layer for modern data applications.__ Born in the cloud era, Cube represents the next evolution of OLAP technology, helping data engineers and application developers access data from modern data stores, organize it into consistent definitions, and deliver it to every application.

&lt;/p&gt;

Cube was designed to work with all SQL-enabled data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Google BigQuery, query engines like Presto or Amazon Athena, and application databases like Postgres. Cube has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

For more details, see the [introduction](https://cube.dev/docs/cubejs-introduction?ref=github-readme) page in our documentation.

## Why Cube?

As data infrastructure evolved from traditional relational databases to cloud data platforms, OLAP capabilities that once lived in specialized servers like SQL Server Analysis Services and Oracle Essbase were left behind. Today&#039;s organizations face several challenges:

1. __Analytics Modeling and Multidimensionality.__ Modern cloud data platforms excel at processing large volumes of data but lack native support for multidimensional analysis and modeling. Cube brings OLAP-style analytics to these platforms, enabling consistent metric definitions and multidimensional analysis.

2. __Performance Optimization.__ While cloud data warehouses have improved query performance through column-oriented storage and distributed processing, they still struggle with complex analytical workloads. Cube provides intelligent caching and pre-aggregation strategies that dramatically improve query response times.

3. __Access Control and Governance.__ Securing and governing access to data across all consuming applications remains critical. Cube offers robust access control to ensure consistent security across your entire data ecosystem.

4. __API Flexibility.__ Legacy OLAP tools were limited in how they exposed data. Cube provides modern REST, GraphQL, and SQL APIs along with support for traditional MDX and DAX interfaces, making it a truly universal semantic layer.

Cube is the missing OLAP engine for the cloud data platform era that provides the necessary infrastructure and features to implement efficient data modeling, access control, and performance optimizations without duplicating analytics modeling, data, or security permissions across different tools.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># JARVIS Voice Assistant

![We are NOT limited by the technology of our time!](poster.jpg)

`Jarvis` - is a voice assistant made as an experiment using neural networks for things like **STT/TTS/Wake Word/NLU** etc.

The main project challenges we try to achieve is:
 - 100% offline *(no cloud)*
 - Open source *(full transparency)*
 - No data collection *(we respect your privacy)*

Our backend stack is ü¶Ä **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** with ‚ù§Ô∏è **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/)**.&lt;br&gt;
For the frontend we use ‚ö°Ô∏è **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** + üõ†Ô∏è **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**.

*Other libraries, tools and packages can be found in source code.*

## Neural Networks

This are the neural networks we are currently using:

 - Speech-To-Text
	 - [Vosk Speech Recognition Toolkit](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) via [Vosk-rs](https://github.com/Bear-03/vosk-rs)
 - Text-To-Speech
	 - [~~Silero TTS~~](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~~Coqui TTS~~](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~~WinRT~~](https://github.com/ndarilek/tts-rs) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~gTTS~](https://github.com/nightlyistaken/tts_rust) *(currently not used)*
	 - [~~SAM~~](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM) *(currently not used)*
 - Wake Word
	 - [Rustpotter](https://github.com/GiviMAD/rustpotter) *(Partially implemented, still WIP)*
	 - [Picovoice Porcupine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine) via [official SDK](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine#rust) *(requires API key)*
	 - [Vosk Speech Recognition Toolkit](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) via [Vosk-rs](https://github.com/Bear-03/vosk-rs) *(very slow)*
	 - [~~Snowboy~~] *(currently not used)*
 - NLU
	 - Nothing yet.
- Chat
	- [~~ChatGPT~~](https://chat.openai.com/) (coming soon)

## Supported Languages

Currently, only Russian language is supported.&lt;br&gt;
But soon, Ukranian and English will be added for the interface, wake-word detection and speech recognition.

## How to build?

Nothing special was used to build this project.&lt;br&gt;
You need only Rust and NodeJS installed on your system.&lt;br&gt;
Other than that, all you need is to install all the dependencies and then compile the code with `cargo tauri build` command.&lt;br&gt;
Or run dev with `cargo tauri dev`.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Thought you might need some of the platform specific libraries for [PvRecorder](https://github.com/Picovoice/pvrecorder) and [Vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api).*

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use‚Äîwhether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]‚Äîwith a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes‚Äîwhich is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

[![Logo](eraLogo.png)](https://zksync.io/)

ZKsync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or
decentralization. Since it&#039;s EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring
or re-auditing a single line of code. ZKsync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers
write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Paddler

Digital products and their users need privacy, reliability, cost control and an option to be independent from third party vendors.

Paddler is an open-source LLMOps platform for organizations that host and scale open-source models in their own infrastructure.

## Key features

&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19e74262-1918-4b1d-9b4c-bcb4f0ab79f5&quot;&gt;

* Inference through a built-in [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) engine
* Load balancing
* Works through agents that can be added dynamically, allowing integration with autoscaling tools
* Request buffering, enabling scaling from zero hosts
* Dynamic model swapping
* Built-in web admin panel for management, monitoring and testing
* Observability metrics

## For whom?

* Product teams that need LLM inference and embeddings in their features
* DevOps/LLMOps teams that need to run and deploy LLMs at scale
* Organizations handling sensitive data with high compliance and privacy requirements (medical, financial, etc.)
* Organizations wanting to achieve predictable LLM costs instead of being exposed to per-token pricing
* Product leaders who need reliable model performance to maintain consistent user experience of their AI-based features

## Documentation

Visit our [documentation page](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/introduction/what-is-paddler/) to install Paddler and get started with it. 

[API documentation](https://paddler.intentee.com/api/introduction/using-paddler-api/) is also available.

[Video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT6QCL8lk08)

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install Paddler, but the goal is to obtain the `paddler` binary and make it available in your system.

You can:

* Option 1: Download the latest release from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/intentee/paddler/releases)
* Option 2: Build Paddler from source

### Using Paddler

The entire Paddler functionality is available through the `paddler` command.

You can run `paddler --help` to see the available commands and options.

Read more about [installation and initial setup](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/introduction/installation/)

## How does it work?

Paddler is built for an easy set up. It comes as a self-contained binary with only two deployable components, the `balancer` and the `agents`. 

The¬†`balancer`¬†exposes the following:

- Inference service (used by applications that connect to it to obtain tokens or embeddings)
- Management service, which manages the Paddler&#039;s setup internally
- Web admin panel that lets you view and test your Paddler setup

`Agents` are usually deployed on separate instances. They further distribute the incoming requests to `slots`, which are responsible for generating tokens and embeddings.

Paddler uses a built-in llama.cpp engine for inference, but has its own implementation of llama.cpp slots which keep their own context and KV cache.

### Web admin panel

Paddler comes with a built-in web admin panel. 

You can use it to monitor your Paddler fleet:
&lt;img width=&quot;1587&quot; height=&quot;732&quot; alt=&quot;paddler-web-admin-panel&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de26312e-e83e-4def-8326-0aa5d559396c&quot; /&gt;

Add and update your model and customize the chat template and inference parameters:
&lt;img width=&quot;1422&quot; height=&quot;1584&quot; alt=&quot;paddler-model&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd9d7eb0-a990-4b1c-b523-7286956baeb2&quot; /&gt;

And use GUI to test the inference:
&lt;img width=&quot;1413&quot; height=&quot;984&quot; alt=&quot;paddler-prompt&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b35b5a-c3de-4acc-a602-c7ffaa21d0a6&quot; /&gt;


## Starting out
* [Setup a basic LLM cluster](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/starting-out/setup-a-basic-llm-cluster/)
* [Use Paddler&#039;s web admin panel](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/starting-out/using-web-admin-panel/)
* [Generate tokens and embeddings](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/starting-out/generating-tokens-and-embeddings/)
* [Use function calling](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/starting-out/using-function-calling/)
* [Create a multi agent fleet](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/starting-out/multi-agent-fleet/)
* [Go beyond a single device](https://paddler.intentee.com/docs/starting-out/going-beyond-a-single-device/)

## Why the Name

We initially wanted to use [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm (thus Paddler, because it paddles on a Raft), but eventually dropped that idea. The name stayed, though.

Later, people started sending us the &quot;that&#039;s a paddlin&#039;&quot; clip from The Simpsons, and we just embraced it.

## Community and contributions

We keep everything simple and on GitHub. Please use GitHub discussions for community conversations, and feel free to contribute.

OpenObserve (O2 for short) is a cloud-native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, RUM (Real User Monitoring - Performance, Errors, Session Replay) designed to work at petabyte scale.

It is straightforward and easy to operate, in contrast to Elasticsearch, which requires understanding and tuning numerous settings. Get OpenObserve up and running in under 2 minutes.

OpenObserve serves as a seamless replacement for Elasticsearch for users who ingest data using APIs and perform searches. OpenObserve comes with its own user interface, eliminating the need for separate installation.

You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch by using OpenObserve. Below, we present the results from pushing logs from our production Kubernetes cluster to both Elasticsearch and OpenObserve using Fluent Bit.

**DISCLAIMER**: Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything that
could happen to your phone.

&lt;img src=&quot;/resources/screenshots/v0.5.0.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; alt=&quot;uad_screenshot&quot;&gt;

**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and feel free to contribute!**

## Summary

This is a complete rewrite in Rust of the [UAD project](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater),
which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary
and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improve security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

Packages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better
understanding of what you can delete or not. The worst issue that could happen
is removing an essential system package needed during boot causing then an unfortunate
bootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot
in recovery mode, and you&#039;ll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. Make a backup first!

In any case, you **CANNOT** brick your device with this software!
That&#039;s the main point, right?

## Features

- [x] Uninstall/Disable and Restore/Enable system packages
- [x] Multi-user support (e.g. apps in work profiles)
- [x] Export/Import your selection in `uad_exported_selection.txt`
- [x] Multi-device support: you can connect multiple phones at the same time
- [x] All your actions are logged, so you never forget what you&#039;ve done

NB : System apps cannot truly be uninstalled without root (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ))

## How to use it

- **Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ)!**
- **Do a proper backup of your data! You can never be too careful!**
- Enable _Developer Options_ on your smartphone.
- Turn on _USB Debugging_ from the developer panel.
- From the settings, disconnect from any OEM accounts (when you delete an OEM
  account package it could lock you on the lockscreen because the phone can&#039;t
  associate your identity anymore)
- Install ADB (see the intructions by clicking on your OS below):
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;LINUX&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install _Android platform tools_ on your PC :

  Debian Base:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools
  ```

  Arch-Linux Base:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S android-tools
  ```

  Red Hat Base:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install android-tools
  ```

  OpenSUSE Base:

  ```bash
  sudo zypper install android-tools
  ```

  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;MAC OS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Install _Android platform tools_

    ```bash
    brew install android-platform-tools
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;WINDOWS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Download [android platform tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
    and unzip it somewhere.
  - [Add the android platform tools to your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
    **OR** make sure to launch UAD from the same directory.

  - [Install USB drivers for your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers)
  - Check your device is detected:

    ```bash
     adb devices
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

- Download the latest release of UAD GUI for your Operating System [here](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases).
  Take the `opengl` version only if the default version (with a Vulkan backend)
  doesn&#039;t launch.

**NOTE:** Chinese phones users may need to use the AOSP list for removing some stock
apps because those Chinese manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) have been
using the name of AOSP packages for their own (modified &amp; closed-source) apps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to run this software whenever your OEM pushes
an update to your phone as some _uninstalled_ system apps could be reinstalled.

InfluxDB Core is a database built to collect, process, transform, and store event and time series data. It is ideal for use cases that require real-time ingest and fast query response times to build user interfaces, monitoring, and automation solutions.

Common use cases include:

- Monitoring sensor data
- Server monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Network monitoring
- Financial market and trading analytics
- Behavioral analytics

InfluxDB is optimized for scenarios where near real-time data monitoring is essential and queries 
need to return quickly to support user experiences such as dashboards and interactive user interfaces.

InfluxDB 3 Core‚Äôs feature highlights include:

- Diskless architecture with object storage support (or local disk with no dependencies)
- Fast query response times (under 10ms for last-value queries, or 30ms for distinct metadata)
- Embedded Python VM for plugins and triggers
- Parquet file persistence
- Compatibility with InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x write APIs
- Compatability with InfluxDB 1.x query API (InfluxQL)
- SQL query engine with support for FlightSQL and HTTP query API

## Project Status

InfluxDB 3 Core is GA as of April 15, 2025! We plan to have monthly point releases for the following six months, with patch releases as needed. We will move to a quarterly cadence after that for 3-4 releases, after which we&#039;ll reevaluate our release schedule.

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| c5n.metal      | al2 linux_5.10   | ubuntu 24.04 | linux_5.10   |

| m7g.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m8g.metal-24xl |                  |              |              |
| m8g.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

&lt;/a&gt;

SurrealDB is available as a [hosted platform](https://surrealist.app/cloud). Forget about infrastructure operations, monitoring, backups or capacity planning. [Surreal Cloud](https://surrealdb.com/cloud) allows you to focus on building great products using the power and flexibility of SurrealDB in just a few clicks. Grow from prototype to enterprise-scale. The Surreal Cloud scalable architecture allows your database to evolve as your application grows, ensuring you are always ahead of demand. However if you want to deploy SurrealDB yourself, keep reading below.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/installation.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

SurrealDB is designed to be simple to install and simple to run - using just one command from your terminal. In addition to traditional installation, SurrealDB can be installed and run with HomeBrew, Docker, or using any other container orchestration tool such as Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Rancher, or in Kubernetes.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/apple.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on macOS&lt;/h4&gt;

The quickest way to get going with SurrealDB on macOS is to use Homebrew. This will install both the command-line tools, and the SurrealDB server as a single executable. If you don&#039;t use Homebrew, follow the instructions for Linux below to install SurrealDB.

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal-nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/linux.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Linux&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Unix operating systems is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

If you want to run a beta release, before the next version is released, the `beta` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --beta
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/windows.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Windows&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Windows is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```ps1
iex &quot;&amp; { $(irm https://windows.surrealdb.com) } -Nightly&quot;
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/docker.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Run using Docker&lt;/h4&gt;

Docker can be used to manage and run SurrealDB database instances without the need to install any command-line tools. The SurrealDB docker container contains the full command-line tools for importing and exporting data from a running server, or for running a server itself.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start
```

For just getting started with a development server running in memory, you can pass the container a basic initialization to set the user and password as root and enable logging.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --log info --user root --pass root memory
``` 

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/features.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Quick look&lt;/h2&gt;

With strongly-typed data types, data can be fully modelled right in the database.

```sql
UPDATE person SET
    waist = &lt;int&gt; &quot;34&quot;,
    height = &lt;float&gt; 201,
    score = &lt;decimal&gt; 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1
;
```

Store dynamically computed fields which are calculated when retrieved.

```sql
DEFINE FIELD can_drive ON TABLE person COMPUTED time::now() &gt; birthday + 18y;
CREATE person SET birthday = d&quot;2007-06-22&quot;;
;
```

Easily work with unstructured or structured data, in schema-less or schema-full mode.

```sql
-- Create a schemafull table
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Specify fields on the user table
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE object;
DEFINE FIELD name.first ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD name.last ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string ASSERT string::is::email($value);

-- Add a unique index on the email field preventing duplicate values
DEFINE INDEX email ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- Create a new event whenever a user changes their email address
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
    CREATE event SET user = $value, time = time::now(), value = $after.email, action = &#039;email_changed&#039;
);
```

Connect records together with fully directed graph edge connections.

```sql
-- Add a graph edge between user:tobie and article:surreal
RELATE user:tobie-&gt;write-&gt;article:surreal
    SET time.written = time::now()
;

-- Add a graph edge between specific users and developers
LET $from = (SELECT users FROM company:surrealdb);
LET $devs = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE tags CONTAINS &#039;developer&#039;);
RELATE $from-&gt;like-&gt;$devs UNIQUE
    SET time.connected = time::now()
;
```

Query data flexibly with advanced expressions and graph queries.

```sql
-- Select a nested array, and filter based on an attribute
SELECT emails[WHERE active = true] FROM person;

-- Select all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level people who this specific person record knows, or likes, as separate outputs
SELECT -&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f1)-&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f2)-&gt;(knows, likes AS e3 WHERE influencer = true)-&gt;(? AS f3) FROM person:tobie;

-- Select all person records (and their recipients), who have sent more than 5 emails
SELECT *, -&gt;sent-&gt;email-&gt;to-&gt;person FROM person WHERE count(-&gt;sent-&gt;email) &gt; 5;

-- Select other products purchased by people who purchased this laptop
SELECT &lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;purchased-&gt;product FROM product:laptop;

-- Select products purchased by people in the last 3 weeks who have purchased the same products that we purchased
SELECT -&gt;purchased-&gt;product&lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;(purchased WHERE created_at &gt; time::now() - 3w)-&gt;product FROM person:tobie;
```

Store GeoJSON geographical data types, including points, lines and polygons.

```sql
UPDATE city:london SET
    centre = (-0.118092, 51.509865),
    boundary = {
        type: &quot;Polygon&quot;,
        coordinates: [[
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386], [0.1785278, 51.37692386],
            [0.1785278, 51.61460570], [-0.38314819, 51.61460570],
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386]
        ]]
    }
;
```

Write custom embedded logic using JavaScript functions.

```sql
CREATE film SET
    ratings = [
        { rating: 6, user: user:bt8e39uh1ouhfm8ko8s0 },
        { rating: 8, user: user:bsilfhu88j04rgs0ga70 },
    ],
    featured = function() {
        return this.ratings.filter(r =&gt; {
            return r.rating &gt;= 7;
        }).map(r =&gt; {
            return { ...r, rating: r.rating * 10 };
        });
    }
;
```

Specify granular access permissions for client and application access.

```sql
-- Specify access permissions for the &#039;post&#039; table
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS
    PERMISSIONS
        FOR select
            -- Published posts can be selected
            WHERE published = true
            -- A user can select all their own posts
            OR user = $auth.id
        FOR create, update
            -- A user can create or update their own posts
            WHERE user = $auth.id
        FOR delete
            -- A user can delete their own posts
            WHERE user = $auth.id
            -- Or an admin can delete any posts
            OR $auth.admin = true
;
```

## Polars: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust using
[Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) as the memory
model.

- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Python

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import polars as pl
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         &quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
...         &quot;fruits&quot;: [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;],
...         &quot;B&quot;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
...         &quot;cars&quot;: [&quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;audi&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;],
...     }
... )

# embarrassingly parallel execution &amp; very expressive query language
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.sort(&quot;fruits&quot;).select(
...     &quot;fruits&quot;,
...     &quot;cars&quot;,
...     pl.lit(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;literal_string_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;B&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;cars&quot;) == &quot;beetle&quot;).sum(),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;B&quot;) &gt; 2).sum().over(&quot;cars&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_cars&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sum().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).reverse().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;rev_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sort_by(&quot;B&quot;).over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sort_A_by_B_by_fruits&quot;),

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

&lt;hr /&gt;

Lance is a modern columnar data format that is optimized for ML workflows and datasets. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and shuffles.
3. Storing, querying, and inspecting deeply nested data for robotics or large blobs like images, point clouds, and more.

The key features of Lance include:

* **High-performance random access:** 100x faster than Parquet without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Vector search:** find nearest neighbors in milliseconds and combine OLAP-queries with vector search.

* **Zero-copy, automatic versioning:** manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.

* **Ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Ray, Spark and more on the way.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/community/contributing) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/ pylance
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## What makes Lance different

Here we will highlight a few aspects of Lance‚Äôs design. For more details, see the full [Lance design document](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/format).

**Vector index**: Vector index for similarity search over embedding space.
Support both CPUs (``x86_64`` and ``arm``) and GPU (``Nvidia (cuda)`` and ``Apple Silicon (mps)``).

**Encodings**: To achieve both fast columnar scan and sub-linear point queries, Lance uses custom encodings and layouts.

**Nested fields**: Lance stores each subfield as a separate column to support efficient filters like ‚Äúfind images where detected objects include cats‚Äù.

**Versioning**: A Manifest can be used to record snapshots. Currently we support creating new versions automatically via appends, overwrites, and index creation.

**Fast updates** (ROADMAP): Updates will be supported via write-ahead logs.

**Rich secondary indices**: Support `BTree`, `Bitmap`, `Full text search`, `Label list`,
`NGrams`, and more.

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

## Why are you building yet another data format?!

The machine learning development cycle involves the steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];
    E --&gt; F[Evaluation];
    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

People use different data representations to varying stages for the performance or limited by the tooling available.
Academia mainly uses XML / JSON for annotations and zipped images/sensors data for deep learning, which
is difficult to integrate into data infrastructure and slow to train over cloud storage.
While industry uses data lakes (Parquet-based techniques, i.e., Delta Lake, Iceberg) or data warehouses (AWS Redshift
or Google BigQuery) to collect and analyze data, they have to convert the data into training-friendly formats, such
as [Rikai](https://github.com/eto-ai/rikai)/[Petastorm](https://github.com/uber/petastorm)
or [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord).
Multiple single-purpose data transforms, as well as syncing copies between cloud storage to local training
instances have become a common practice.

While each of the existing data formats excels at the workload it was originally designed for, we need a new data format
tailored for multistage ML development cycles to reduce and data silos.

A comparison of different data formats in each stage of ML development cycle.

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.82 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!
