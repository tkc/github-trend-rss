            <h2>README</h2><pre># ![Application Icon for Edit](./assets/edit.svg) Edit

A simple editor for simple needs.

This editor pays homage to the classic [MS-DOS Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor), but with a modern interface and input controls similar to VS Code. The goal is to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/microsoft-edit.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/microsoft-edit/versions)

You can also download binaries from [our Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/edit/releases/latest).

### Windows

You can install the latest version with WinGet:
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Edit
```

## Build Instructions

* [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Install the nightly toolchain: `rustup install nightly`
  * Alternatively, set the environment variable `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`
* Clone the repository
* For a release build, run: `cargo build --config .cargo/release.toml --release`

## Notes to Package Maintainers

### Package Naming

The canonical executable name is &quot;edit&quot; and the alternative name is &quot;msedit&quot;.
We&#039;re aware of the potential conflict of &quot;edit&quot; with existing commands and recommend alternatively naming packages and executables &quot;msedit&quot;.
Names such as &quot;ms-edit&quot; should be avoided.
Assigning an &quot;edit&quot; alias is recommended, if possible.

### ICU library name (SONAME)

This project _optionally_ depends on the ICU library for its Search and Replace functionality.
By default, the project will look for a SONAME without version suffix:
* Windows: `icuuc.dll`
* macOS: `libicuuc.dylib`
* UNIX, and other OS: `libicuuc.so`

If your installation uses a different SONAME, please set the following environment variable at build time:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicuuc.so.76`.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicui18n.so.76`.

Additionally, this project assumes that the ICU exports are exported without `_` prefix and without version suffix, such as `u_errorName`.
If your installation uses versioned exports, please set:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_CPP_EXPORTS`:
  If set to `true`, it&#039;ll look for C++ symbols such as `_u_errorName`.
  Enabled by default on macOS.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION`:
  If set to a version number, such as `76`, it&#039;ll look for symbols such as `u_errorName_76`.

Finally, you can set the following environment variables:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_AUTO_DETECT`:
  If set to `true`, the executable will try to detect the `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION` value at runtime.
  The way it does this is not officially supported by ICU and as such is not recommended to be relied upon.
  Enabled by default on UNIX (excluding macOS) if no other options are set.

To test your settings, run `cargo test` again but with the `--ignored` flag. For instance:
```sh
cargo test -- --ignored
```

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant
preview, you can also check out [Typst&#039;s free web app][app].

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /taɪpst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

[![License: MIT OR Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/clippy.svg)](#license)

A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) code.

[There are over 750 lints included in this crate!](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html)

Lints are divided into categories, each with a default [lint level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html).
You can choose how much Clippy is supposed to ~~annoy~~ help you by changing the lint level by category.

| Category              | Description                                                                         | Default level |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `clippy::all`         | all lints that are on by default (correctness, suspicious, style, complexity, perf) | **warn/deny** |
| `clippy::correctness` | code that is outright wrong or useless                                              | **deny**      |
| `clippy::suspicious`  | code that is most likely wrong or useless                                           | **warn**      |
| `clippy::style`       | code that should be written in a more idiomatic way                                 | **warn**      |
| `clippy::complexity`  | code that does something simple but in a complex way                                | **warn**      |
| `clippy::perf`        | code that can be written to run faster                                              | **warn**      |
| `clippy::pedantic`    | lints which are rather strict or have occasional false positives                    | allow         |
| `clippy::restriction` | lints which prevent the use of language and library features[^restrict]             | allow         |
| `clippy::nursery`     | new lints that are still under development                                          | allow         |
| `clippy::cargo`       | lints for the cargo manifest                                                        | allow         |

More to come, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues) if you have ideas!

The `restriction` category should, *emphatically*, not be enabled as a whole. The contained
lints may lint against perfectly reasonable code, may not have an alternative suggestion,
and may contradict any other lints (including other categories). Lints should be considered
on a case-by-case basis before enabling.

[^restrict]: Some use cases for `restriction` lints include:
    - Strict coding styles (e.g. [`clippy::else_if_without_else`]).
    - Additional restrictions on CI (e.g. [`clippy::todo`]).
    - Preventing panicking in certain functions (e.g. [`clippy::unwrap_used`]).
    - Running a lint only on a subset of code (e.g. `#[forbid(clippy::float_arithmetic)]` on a module).

[`clippy::else_if_without_else`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#else_if_without_else
[`clippy::todo`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#todo

## Usage

Below are instructions on how to use Clippy as a cargo subcommand,
in projects that do not use cargo, or in Travis CI.

### As a cargo subcommand (`cargo clippy`)

One way to use Clippy is by installing Clippy through rustup as a cargo
subcommand.

#### Step 1: Install Rustup

You can install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) on supported platforms. This will help
us install Clippy and its dependencies.

If you already have Rustup installed, update to ensure you have the latest
Rustup and compiler:

```terminal
rustup update
```

#### Step 2: Install Clippy

Once you have rustup and the latest stable release (at least Rust 1.29) installed, run the following command:

```terminal
rustup component add clippy
```

If it says that it can&#039;t find the `clippy` component, please run `rustup self update`.

#### Step 3: Run Clippy

Now you can run Clippy by invoking the following command:

```terminal
cargo clippy
```

#### Automatically applying Clippy suggestions

Clippy can automatically apply some lint suggestions, just like the compiler. Note that `--fix` implies
`--all-targets`, so it can fix as much code as it can.

```terminal
cargo clippy --fix
```

#### Workspaces

All the usual workspace options should work with Clippy. For example the following command
will run Clippy on the `example` crate:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example
```

As with `cargo check`, this includes dependencies that are members of the workspace, like path dependencies.
If you want to run Clippy **only** on the given crate, use the `--no-deps` option like this:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example -- --no-deps
```

### Using `clippy-driver`

Clippy can also be used in projects that do not use cargo. To do so, run `clippy-driver`
with the same arguments you use for `rustc`. For example:

```terminal
clippy-driver --edition 2018 -Cpanic=abort foo.rs
```

Note that `clippy-driver` is designed for running Clippy only and should not be used as a general
replacement for `rustc`. `clippy-driver` may produce artifacts that are not optimized as expected,
for example.

### Travis CI

You can add Clippy to Travis CI in the same way you use it locally:

```yaml
language: rust
rust:
  - stable
  - beta
before_script:
  - rustup component add clippy
script:
  - cargo clippy
  # if you want the build job to fail when encountering warnings, use
  - cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  # in order to also check tests and non-default crate features, use
  - cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  - cargo test
  # etc.
```

Note that adding `-D warnings` will cause your build to fail if **any** warnings are found in your code.
That includes warnings found by rustc (e.g. `dead_code`, etc.). If you want to avoid this and only cause
an error for Clippy warnings, use `#![deny(clippy::all)]` in your code or `-D clippy::all` on the command
line. (You can swap `clippy::all` with the specific lint category you are targeting.)

## Configuration

### Allowing/denying lints

You can add options to your code to `allow`/`warn`/`deny` Clippy lints:

* the whole set of `Warn` lints using the `clippy` lint group (`#![deny(clippy::all)]`).
  Note that `rustc` has additional [lint groups](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/groups.html).

* all lints using both the `clippy` and `clippy::pedantic` lint groups (`#![deny(clippy::all)]`,
  `#![deny(clippy::pedantic)]`). Note that `clippy::pedantic` contains some very aggressive
  lints prone to false positives.

* only some lints (`#![deny(clippy::single_match, clippy::box_vec)]`, etc.)

* `allow`/`warn`/`deny` can be limited to a single function or module using `#[allow(...)]`, etc.

Note: `allow` means to suppress the lint for your code. With `warn` the lint
will only emit a warning, while with `deny` the lint will emit an error, when
triggering for your code. An error causes Clippy to exit with an error code, so
is useful in scripts like CI/CD.

If you do not want to include your lint levels in your code, you can globally
enable/disable lints by passing extra flags to Clippy during the run:

To allow `lint_name`, run

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::lint_name
```

And to warn on `lint_name`, run

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::lint_name
```

This also works with lint groups. For example, you
can run Clippy with warnings for all lints enabled:

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

If you care only about a single lint, you can allow all others and then explicitly warn on
the lint(s) you are interested in:

```terminal
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::all -W clippy::useless_format -W clippy::...
```

### Configure the behavior of some lints

Some lints can be configured in a TOML file named `clippy.toml` or `.clippy.toml`. It contains a basic `variable =
value` mapping e.g.

```toml
avoid-breaking-exported-api = false
disallowed-names = [&quot;toto&quot;, &quot;tata&quot;, &quot;titi&quot;]
```

The [table of configurations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/lint_configuration.html)
contains all config values, their default, and a list of lints they affect.
Each [configurable lint](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#Configuration)
, also contains information about these values.

For configurations that are a list type with default values such as
[disallowed-names](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#disallowed_names),
you can use the unique value `&quot;..&quot;` to extend the default values instead of replacing them.

```toml
# default of disallowed-names is [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;quux&quot;]
disallowed-names = [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;..&quot;] # -&gt; [&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;quux&quot;]
```

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; `clippy.toml` or `.clippy.toml` cannot be used to allow/deny lints.

To deactivate the “for further information visit *lint-link*” message you can
define the `CLIPPY_DISABLE_DOCS_LINKS` environment variable.

### Specifying the minimum supported Rust version

Projects that intend to support old versions of Rust can disable lints pertaining to newer features by
specifying the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) in the Clippy configuration file.

```toml
msrv = &quot;1.30.0&quot;
```

Alternatively, the [`rust-version` field](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field)
in the `Cargo.toml` can be used.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
rust-version = &quot;1.30&quot;
```

The MSRV can also be specified as an attribute, like below.

```rust,ignore
#![feature(custom_inner_attributes)]
#![clippy::msrv = &quot;1.30.0&quot;]

fn main() {
  ...
}
```

You can also omit the patch version when specifying the MSRV, so `msrv = 1.30`
is equivalent to `msrv = 1.30.0`.

Note: `custom_inner_attributes` is an unstable feature, so it has to be enabled explicitly.

Lints that recognize this configuration option can be found [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#msrv)

Harper is an English grammar checker designed to be _just right._
I created it after years of dealing with the shortcomings of the competition.

Grammarly was too expensive and too overbearing.
Its suggestions lacked context, and were often just plain _wrong_.
Not to mention: it&#039;s a privacy nightmare.
Everything you write with Grammarly is sent to their servers.
Their privacy policy claims they don&#039;t sell the data, but that doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t use it to train large language models and god knows what else.
Not only that, but the round-trip-time of the network request makes revising your work all the more tedious.

LanguageTool is great, if you have gigabytes of RAM to spare and are willing to download the ~16GB n-gram dataset.
Besides the memory requirements, I found LanguageTool too slow: it would take several seconds to lint even a moderate-size document.

That&#039;s why I created Harper: it is the grammar checker that fits my needs.
Not only does it take milliseconds to lint a document, take less than 1/50th of LanguageTool&#039;s memory footprint,
but it is also completely private.

Harper is even small enough to load via [WebAssembly.](https://writewithharper.com)

## Language Support

Harper currently only supports English, but the core is extensible to support other languages, so we welcome contributions that allow for other language support.

## Performance Issues

We consider long lint times bugs.
If you encounter any significant performance issues, please create an issue on the topic.

If you find a fix to any performance issue, we would appreciate the contribution.
Just please make sure to read [our contribution guidelines first.](https://github.com/automattic/harper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

**NEWS: [USENIX ATC&#039;25](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25) accepted two research papers on Asterinas: (1) _Asterinas: A Linux ABI-Compatible, Rust-Based Framekernel OS with a Small and Sound TCB_ and (2) _Converos: Practical Model Checking for Verifying Rust OS Kernel Concurrency_. Congratulations to the Asterinas community🎉🎉🎉**

## Introducing Asterinas

Asterinas is a _secure_, _fast_, and _general-purpose_ OS kernel
that provides _Linux-compatible_ ABI.
It can serve as a seamless replacement for Linux
while enhancing _memory safety_ and _developer friendliness_.

* Asterinas prioritizes memory safety
by employing Rust as its sole programming language
and limiting the use of _unsafe Rust_
to a clearly defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This innovative approach,
known as [the framekernel architecture](https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.html),
establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option.

* Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness.
It empowers kernel developers to
(1) utilize the more productive Rust programming language,
(2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called [OSDK](https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/index.html) to streamline their workflows,
and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as open source
or keeping them proprietary,
thanks to the flexibility offered by [MPL](#License).

While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel is challenging,
we are steadfastly progressing towards this goal.
Over the course of 2024,
we significantly enhanced Asterinas&#039;s maturity,
as detailed in [our end-year report](https://asterinas.github.io/2025/01/20/asterinas-in-2024.html).
In 2025, our primary goal is to make Asterinas production-ready on x86-64 virtual machines
and attract real users!

## Getting Started

Get yourself an x86-64 Linux machine with Docker installed.
Follow the three simple steps below to get Asterinas up and running.

1. Download the latest source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas
```

2. Run a Docker container as the development environment.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --network=host --device=/dev/kvm -v $(pwd)/asterinas:/root/asterinas asterinas/asterinas:0.15.1-20250603
```

3. Inside the container, go to the project folder to build and run Asterinas.

```bash
make build
make run
```

If everything goes well, Asterinas is now up and running inside a VM.

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. Its based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

**Czkawka** (_tch•kav•ka_ (IPA: [ˈʧ̑kafka]), &quot;hiccup&quot; in Polish) is a simple, fast and free app to remove unnecessary
files from your computer.

**Krokiet** ((IPA: [ˈkrɔcɛt]), &quot;croquet&quot; in Polish) same as above, but uses Slint frontend.

## Features

- Written in memory-safe Rust - almost 100% unsafe code free
- Amazingly fast - due to using more or less advanced algorithms and multithreading
- Free, Open Source without ads
- Multiplatform - works on Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD and many more
- Cache support - second and further scans should be much faster than the first one
- CLI frontend - for easy automation
- GUI frontend - uses GTK 4 or Slint frameworks
- No spying - Czkawka does not have access to the Internet, nor does it collect any user information or statistics
- Multilingual - support multiple languages like Polish, English or Italian
- Multiple tools to use:
    - Duplicates - Finds duplicates based on file name, size or hash
    - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of an advanced algorithm
    - Big Files - Finds the provided number of the biggest files in given location
    - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across the drive
    - Temporary Files - Finds temporary files
    - Similar Images - Finds images which are not exactly the same (different resolution, watermarks)
    - Similar Videos - Looks for visually similar videos
    - Same Music - Searches for similar music by tags or by reading content and comparing it
    - Invalid Symbolic Links - Shows symbolic links which point to non-existent files/directories
    - Broken Files - Finds files that are invalid or corrupted
    - Bad Extensions - Lists files whose content not match with their extension

Changelog about each version can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

New releases can be found in [Github releases](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases) and nightly builds also in [Nightly releases](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/tag/Nightly)

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it), supports video thumbnails

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Thanks

Big thanks to Pádraig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display

There is an ESP32 with a built in 320 x 240 2.8&quot; LCD display with a touch screen called the &quot;ESP32-2432S028R&quot;, since this doesn&#039;t roll of the tongue, I propose it should be renamed the &quot;Cheap Yellow Display&quot; or CYD for short. This display is only about $15 delivered so I think it&#039;s really good value.

![image](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display/assets/1562562/76c3d481-2523-4b6f-881c-2e29f9368cd0)

## Features

The CYD has the following features:

- ESP32 (With Wifi and Bluetooth)
- 320 x 240 LCD Display (2.8&quot;)
- Touch Screen (Resistive)
- USB for powering and programming
- SD Card Slot, LED and some additional pins broken out

## Who is it good for?

I think it&#039;s useful for the following types of people:

- **People just getting started with working hardware** - as everything is already connected, there is no soldering or additional components required
- **People who are familiar with working with hardware, but are lazy** - (like me) Sometimes you just want to build a project without having to assemble any hardware
- **People who aren&#039;t really looking to learn anything, but just want to build some cool things** - More about this later.

## What is the purpose of this page?

So this is pretty nice hardware and a cheap price, but the software instructions/support around it is pretty poor. Just a single link to a zip file on a random website.

A couple of years ago I released the [ESP32 Trinity](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Trinity), which is an open source ESP32 board for controlling Matrix panels. I think the main benefit people get out of the work I did on the Trinty is not the hardware, but the documentation, example code and ready to go projects.

I&#039;m no longer creating hardware products, but I think it would be interesting if we could create the same kind of community around this display, where people can share examples and projects made for this display.

## How do I know if a display is a CYD?
![CYD decision tree](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/RP0nJyCm48Nt_8gZNIb3fge3LD2b2q92235UamDRE7PaNuhyxxda7DGgJBs-zxtSE-yJO-IXSzKD6-e8UeVMLyQs1DJrdA6br4JRims-4fW9LiS4bY6JS-47qBTWC052QvEayyCAvA-wS-8vi01F7mS8SVevOxJeUK9zu55QzzP_Nw-exxPmz8tHJzRRsJq4cdo3Pu98oIQsCd4O6WDIbyXF4LN-JNMsYG7UNXyXUAUTLHDfqVeMJWClUfSPrY_OOyPtO_ivUPcfnoMV3iyXJh4cj_MGJd8lEleQkvQKi9TYUT_DvbukXnraIfTQURMT39Nu8kcrXInIwQYO-gCyNwgm6al-ZneTNIRqjLokqS2UV3jqxXS0)

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## Installation

Alacritty can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, BSD,
macOS and Windows.

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Windows can also be downloaded from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty&#039;s configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn&#039;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty&#039;s performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn&#039;t feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it&#039;s just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won&#039;t find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Ray](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ray/) provides a distributed version of DataFusion that scales
  out on Ray clusters.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.
See the [Architecture] section for more details.

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html
[dependabot]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot

&lt;/a&gt;

SurrealDB is available as a [hosted platform](https://surrealist.app/cloud). Forget about infrastructure operations, monitoring, backups or capacity planning. [Surreal Cloud](https://surrealdb.com/cloud) allows you to focus on building great products using the power and flexibility of SurrealDB in just a few clicks. Grow from prototype to enterprise-scale. The Surreal Cloud scalable architecture allows your database to evolve as your application grows, ensuring you are always ahead of demand. However if you want to deploy SurrealDB yourself, keep reading below.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/installation.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

SurrealDB is designed to be simple to install and simple to run - using just one command from your terminal. In addition to traditional installation, SurrealDB can be installed and run with HomeBrew, Docker, or using any other container orchestration tool such as Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Rancher, or in Kubernetes.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/apple.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on macOS&lt;/h4&gt;

The quickest way to get going with SurrealDB on macOS is to use Homebrew. This will install both the command-line tools, and the SurrealDB server as a single executable. If you don&#039;t use Homebrew, follow the instructions for Linux below to install SurrealDB.

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal-nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/linux.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Linux&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Unix operating systems is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

If you want to run a beta release, before the next version is released, the `beta` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --beta
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/windows.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Windows&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Windows is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```ps1
iex &quot;&amp; { $(irm https://windows.surrealdb.com) } -Nightly&quot;
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/docker.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Run using Docker&lt;/h4&gt;

Docker can be used to manage and run SurrealDB database instances without the need to install any command-line tools. The SurrealDB docker container contains the full command-line tools for importing and exporting data from a running server, or for running a server itself.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start
```

For just getting started with a development server running in memory, you can pass the container a basic initialization to set the user and password as root and enable logging.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --log info --user root --pass root memory
``` 

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/features.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Quick look&lt;/h2&gt;

With strongly-typed data types, data can be fully modelled right in the database.

```sql
UPDATE person SET
    waist = &lt;int&gt; &quot;34&quot;,
    height = &lt;float&gt; 201,
    score = &lt;decimal&gt; 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1
;
```

Store dynamically computed fields which are calculated when retrieved.

```sql
CREATE person SET
    birthday = &lt;datetime&gt; &quot;2007-06-22&quot;,
    can_drive = &lt;future&gt; { time::now() &gt; birthday + 18y }
;
```

Easily work with unstructured or structured data, in schema-less or schema-full mode.

```sql
-- Create a schemafull table
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Specify fields on the user table
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE object;
DEFINE FIELD name.first ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD name.last ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string ASSERT string::is::email($value);

-- Add a unique index on the email field preventing duplicate values
DEFINE INDEX email ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- Create a new event whenever a user changes their email address
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
    CREATE event SET user = $value, time = time::now(), value = $after.email, action = &#039;email_changed&#039;
);
```

Connect records together with fully directed graph edge connections.

```sql
-- Add a graph edge between user:tobie and article:surreal
RELATE user:tobie-&gt;write-&gt;article:surreal
    SET time.written = time::now()
;

-- Add a graph edge between specific users and developers
LET $from = (SELECT users FROM company:surrealdb);
LET $devs = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE tags CONTAINS &#039;developer&#039;);
RELATE $from-&gt;like-&gt;$devs UNIQUE
    SET time.connected = time::now()
;
```

Query data flexibly with advanced expressions and graph queries.

```sql
-- Select a nested array, and filter based on an attribute
SELECT emails[WHERE active = true] FROM person;

-- Select all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level people who this specific person record knows, or likes, as separate outputs
SELECT -&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f1)-&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f2)-&gt;(knows, likes AS e3 WHERE influencer = true)-&gt;(? AS f3) FROM person:tobie;

-- Select all person records (and their recipients), who have sent more than 5 emails
SELECT *, -&gt;sent-&gt;email-&gt;to-&gt;person FROM person WHERE count(-&gt;sent-&gt;email) &gt; 5;

-- Select other products purchased by people who purchased this laptop
SELECT &lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;purchased-&gt;product FROM product:laptop;

-- Select products purchased by people in the last 3 weeks who have purchased the same products that we purchased
SELECT -&gt;purchased-&gt;product&lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;(purchased WHERE created_at &gt; time::now() - 3w)-&gt;product FROM person:tobie;
```

Store GeoJSON geographical data types, including points, lines and polygons.

```sql
UPDATE city:london SET
    centre = (-0.118092, 51.509865),
    boundary = {
        type: &quot;Polygon&quot;,
        coordinates: [[
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386], [0.1785278, 51.37692386],
            [0.1785278, 51.61460570], [-0.38314819, 51.61460570],
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386]
        ]]
    }
;
```

Write custom embedded logic using JavaScript functions.

```sql
CREATE film SET
    ratings = [
        { rating: 6, user: user:bt8e39uh1ouhfm8ko8s0 },
        { rating: 8, user: user:bsilfhu88j04rgs0ga70 },
    ],
    featured = function() {
        return this.ratings.filter(r =&gt; {
            return r.rating &gt;= 7;
        }).map(r =&gt; {
            return { ...r, rating: r.rating * 10 };
        });
    }
;
```

Specify granular access permissions for client and application access.

```sql
-- Specify access permissions for the &#039;post&#039; table
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS
    PERMISSIONS
        FOR select
            -- Published posts can be selected
            WHERE published = true
            -- A user can select all their own posts
            OR user = $auth.id
        FOR create, update
            -- A user can create or update their own posts
            WHERE user = $auth.id
        FOR delete
            -- A user can delete their own posts
            WHERE user = $auth.id
            -- Or an admin can delete any posts
            OR $auth.admin = true
;
```

&lt;img src=&quot;assets/image-5.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/image-4.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Features

- **Decentralized**: No need to rely on centralized services, nodes are equal and independent.
- **Safe**: Use WireGuard protocol to encrypt data.
- **High Performance**: Full-link zero-copy, with performance comparable to mainstream networking software.
- **Cross-platform**: Supports MacOS/Linux/Windows/Android, will support IOS in the future. The executable file is statically linked, making deployment simple.
- **Networking without public IP**: Supports networking using shared public nodes, refer to [Configuration Guide](#Networking-without-public-IP)
- **NAT traversal**: Supports UDP-based NAT traversal, able to establish stable connections even in complex network environments.
- **Subnet Proxy (Point-to-Network)**: Nodes can expose accessible network segments as proxies to the VPN subnet, allowing other nodes to access these subnets through the node.
- **Smart Routing**: Selects links based on traffic to reduce latency and increase throughput.
- **TCP Support**: Provides reliable data transmission through concurrent TCP links when UDP is limited, optimizing performance.
- **High Availability**: Supports multi-path and switches to healthy paths when high packet loss or network errors are detected.
- **IPv6 Support**: Supports networking using IPv6.
- **Multiple Protocol Types**: Supports communication between nodes using protocols such as WebSocket and QUIC.
- **Web Management Interface**: Provides a [web-based management](https://easytier.cn/web) interface for easy configuration and monitoring.

## Quick Start

&gt; The following text only describes the use of the command-line tool; the GUI program can be configured by referring to the following concepts.

Make sure EasyTier is installed according to the [Installation Guide](#Installation), and both easytier-core and easytier-cli commands are available.

### Two-node Networking

Assuming the network topology of the two nodes is as follows

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Node A IP 22.1.1.1
nodea[EasyTier\n10.144.144.1]
end

subgraph Node B
nodeb[EasyTier\n10.144.144.2]
end

nodea &lt;-----&gt; nodeb

```

1. Execute on Node A:

    ```sh
    sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.1
    ```

    Successful execution of the command will print the following.

    ![alt text](/assets/image-2.png)

2. Execute on Node B

    ```sh
    sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 --peers udp://22.1.1.1:11010
    ```

3. Test Connectivity

    The two nodes should connect successfully and be able to communicate within the virtual subnet

    ```sh
    ping 10.144.144.2
    ```

    Use easytier-cli to view node information in the subnet

    ```sh
    easytier-cli peer
    ```

    ```sh
    easytier-cli node
    ```

### Multi-node Networking

Based on the two-node networking example just now, if more nodes need to join the virtual network, you can use the following command.

```sh
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 --peers udp://22.1.1.1:11010
```

The `--peers` parameter can fill in the listening address of any node already in the virtual network.

---

### Subnet Proxy (Point-to-Network) Configuration

Assuming the network topology is as follows, Node B wants to share its accessible subnet 10.1.1.0/24 with other nodes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph Node A IP 22.1.1.1
nodea[EasyTier\n10.144.144.1]
end

subgraph Node B
nodeb[EasyTier\n10.144.144.2]
end

id1[[10.1.1.0/24]]

nodea &lt;--&gt; nodeb &lt;-.-&gt; id1

```

Then the startup parameters for Node B&#039;s easytier are (new -n parameter)

```sh
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 -n 10.1.1.0/24
```

Subnet proxy information will automatically sync to each node in the virtual network, and each node will automatically configure the corresponding route. Node A can check whether the subnet proxy is effective through the following command.

1. Check whether the routing information has been synchronized, the proxy_cidrs column shows the proxied subnets.

    ```sh
    easytier-cli route
    ```

   ![alt text](/assets/image-3.png)

2. Test whether Node A can access nodes under the proxied subnet

    ```sh
    ping 10.1.1.2
    ```

---

### Networking without Public IP

EasyTier supports networking using shared public nodes. The currently deployed shared public node is ``tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010``.

When using shared nodes, each node entering the network needs to provide the same ``--network-name`` and ``--network-secret`` parameters as the unique identifier of the network.

Taking two nodes as an example, Node A executes:

```sh
sudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.1 --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010
```

Node B executes

```sh
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.2 --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010
```

After the command is successfully executed, Node A can access Node B through the virtual IP 10.144.144.2.

### Use EasyTier with WireGuard Client

EasyTier can be used as a WireGuard server to allow any device with WireGuard client installed to access the EasyTier network. For platforms currently unsupported by EasyTier (such as iOS, Android, etc.), this method can be used to connect to the EasyTier network.

Assuming the network topology is as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

ios[[iPhone \n WireGuard Installed]]

subgraph Node A IP 22.1.1.1
nodea[EasyTier\n10.144.144.1]
end

subgraph Node B
nodeb[EasyTier\n10.144.144.2]
end

id1[[10.1.1.0/24]]

ios &lt;-.-&gt; nodea &lt;--&gt; nodeb &lt;-.-&gt; id1
```

To enable an iPhone to access the EasyTier network through Node A, the following configuration can be applied:

Include the --vpn-portal parameter in the easytier-core command on Node A to specify the port that the WireGuard service listens on and the subnet used by the WireGuard network.

```sh
# The following parameters mean: listen on port 0.0.0.0:11013, and use the 10.14.14.0/24 subnet for WireGuard
sudo easytier-core --ipv4 10.144.144.1 --vpn-portal wg://0.0.0.0:11013/10.14.14.0/24
```

After successfully starting easytier-core, use easytier-cli to obtain the WireGuard client configuration.

```sh
$&gt; easytier-cli vpn-portal
portal_name: wireguard

############### client_config_start ###############

[Interface]
PrivateKey = 9VDvlaIC9XHUvRuE06hD2CEDrtGF+0lDthgr9SZfIho=
Address = 10.14.14.0/32 # should assign an ip from this cidr manually

[Peer]
PublicKey = zhrZQg4QdPZs8CajT3r4fmzcNsWpBL9ImQCUsnlXyGM=
AllowedIPs = 10.144.144.0/24,10.14.14.0/24
Endpoint = 0.0.0.0:11013 # should be the public ip(or domain) of the vpn server
PersistentKeepalive = 25

############### client_config_end ###############

connected_clients:
[]
```

Before using the Client Config, you need to modify the Interface Address and Peer Endpoint to the client&#039;s IP and the IP of the EasyTier node, respectively. Import the configuration file into the WireGuard client to access the EasyTier network.

### Self-Hosted Public Server

Every virtual network (with same network name and secret) can act as a public server cluster. Nodes of other network can connect to arbitrary nodes in public server cluster to discover each other without public IP.

Run you own public server cluster is exactly same as running an virtual network, except that you can skip config the ipv4 addr.

You can also join the official public server cluster with following command:

```
sudo easytier-core --network-name easytier --network-secret easytier -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010
```


### Configurations

You can use ``easytier-core --help`` to view all configuration items

&gt; An alternative private front-end to Reddit, with its origins in [Libreddit](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit).

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/18vrdxk/redlib-rust.png)

---

**10-second pitch:** Redlib is a private front-end like [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) but for Reddit. Browse the coldest takes of [r/unpopularopinion](https://farside.link/redlib/r/unpopularopinion) without being [tracked](#reddit).

- 🚀 Fast: written in Rust for blazing-fast speeds and memory safety
- ☁️ Light: no JavaScript, no ads, no tracking, no bloat
- 🕵 Private: all requests are proxied through the server, including media
- 🔒 Secure: strong [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) prevents browser requests to Reddit

# About

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Find Redlib on 💬 [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#redlib:matrix.org), 🐋 [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/redlib/redlib), :octocat: [GitHub](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib), and 🦊 [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/redlib/redlib).

Redlib hopes to provide an easier way to browse Reddit, without the ads, trackers, and bloat. Redlib was inspired by other alternative front-ends to popular services such as [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) for YouTube, [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) for Twitter, and [Bibliogram](https://sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram/) for Instagram.

Redlib currently implements most of Reddit&#039;s (signed-out) functionalities but still lacks [a few features](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/issues).

## Built with

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Programming language
- [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) - HTTP server and client
- [Rinja](https://github.com/rinja-rs/rinja) - Templating engine
- [Rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) - TLS library

## How is it different from other Reddit front ends?

### Teddit

Teddit is another awesome open source project designed to provide an alternative frontend to Reddit. There is no connection between the two, and you&#039;re welcome to use whichever one you favor. Competition fosters innovation and Teddit&#039;s release has motivated me to build Redlib into an even more polished product.

If you are looking to compare, the biggest differences I have noticed are:

- Redlib is themed around Reddit&#039;s redesign whereas Teddit appears to stick much closer to Reddit&#039;s old design. This may suit some users better as design is always subjective.
- Redlib is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for speed and memory safety. It uses [Hyper](https://hyper.rs), a speedy and lightweight HTTP server/client implementation.

### Libreddit

While originating as a fork of Libreddit, the name &quot;Redlib&quot; was adopted to avoid legal issues, as Reddit only allows the use of their name if structured as &quot;XYZ For Reddit&quot;.

Several technical improvements have also been made, including:

- **OAuth token spoofing**: To circumvent rate limits imposed by Reddit, OAuth token spoofing is used to mimick the most common iOS and Android clients. While spoofing both iOS and Android clients was explored, only the Android client was chosen due to content restrictions when using an anonymous iOS client.
- **Token refreshing**: The authentication token is refreshed every 24 hours, emulating the behavior of the official Android app.
- **HTTP header mimicking**: Efforts are made to send along as many of the official app&#039;s headers as possible to reduce the likelihood of Reddit&#039;s crackdown on Redlib&#039;s requests.

# Comparison

This section outlines how Redlib compares to Reddit in terms of speed and privacy.

## Speed

Last tested on January 12, 2024.

Results from Google PageSpeed Insights ([Redlib Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fredlib.matthew.science%2F), [Reddit Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https://www.reddit.com)).

| Performance metric  | Redlib   | Reddit    |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Speed Index         | 0.6s     | 1.9s      |
| Performance Score   | 100%     | 64%       |
| Time to Interactive | **2.8s** | **12.4s** |

## Privacy

### Reddit

**Logging:** According to Reddit&#039;s [privacy policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy), they &quot;may [automatically] log information&quot; including:

- IP address
- User-agent string
- Browser type
- Operating system
- Referral URLs
- Device information (e.g., device IDs)
- Device settings
- Pages visited
- Links clicked
- The requested URL
- Search terms

**Location:** The same privacy policy goes on to describe that location data may be collected through the use of:

- GPS (consensual)
- Bluetooth (consensual)
- Content associated with a location (consensual)
- Your IP Address

**Cookies:** Reddit&#039;s [cookie notice](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookies) documents the array of cookies used by Reddit including/regarding:

- Authentication
- Functionality
- Analytics and Performance
- Advertising
- Third-Party Cookies
- Third-Party Site

### Redlib

For transparency, I hope to describe all the ways Redlib handles user privacy.

#### Server

- **Logging:** In production (when running the binary, hosting with docker, or using the official instances), Redlib logs nothing. When debugging (running from source without `--release`), Redlib logs post IDs fetched to aid with troubleshooting.

- **Cookies:** Redlib uses optional cookies to store any configured settings in the settings menu. These are not cross-site cookies and the cookies hold no personal data.

---

# Deployment

This section covers multiple ways of deploying Redlib. Using [Docker](#docker) is recommended for production.

For configuration options, see the [Configuration section](#Configuration).

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) lets you run containerized applications. Containers are loosely isolated environments that are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so there&#039;s no need to rely on what&#039;s installed on the host.

Container images for Redlib are available at [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/redlib/redlib), with support for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `armv7` platforms.

### Docker Compose

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; These instructions assume the [Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/#what-are-the-differences-between-compose-v1-and-compose-v2) has already been installed. If not, follow these [instructions on the Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) for how to do so.

Copy `compose.yaml` and modify any relevant values (for example, the ports Redlib should listen on).

Start Redlib in detached mode (running in the background):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Stream logs from the Redlib container:

```bash
docker logs -f redlib
```

### Docker CLI

Deploy Redlib:

```bash
docker pull quay.io/redlib/redlib:latest
docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 quay.io/redlib/redlib:latest
```

Deploy using a different port on the host (in this case, port 80):

```bash
docker pull quay.io/redlib/redlib:latest
docker run -d --name redlib -p 80:8080 quay.io/redlib/redlib:latest
```

If you&#039;re using a reverse proxy in front of Redlib, prefix the port numbers with `127.0.0.1` so that Redlib only listens on the host port **locally**. For example, if the host port for Redlib is `8080`, specify `127.0.0.1:8080:8080`.

Stream logs from the Redlib container:

```bash
docker logs -f redlib
```
## Podman 

[Podman](https://podman.io/) lets you run containerized applications in a rootless fashion. Containers are loosely isolated environments that are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so there&#039;s no need to rely on what&#039;s installed on the host.

Container images for Redlib are available at [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/redlib/redlib), with support for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `armv7` platforms.

### Quadlets

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; These instructions assume that you are on a systemd based distro with [podman](https://podman.io/). If not, follow these [instructions on podman&#039;s website](https://podman.io/docs/installation) for how to do so. 
&gt; It also assumes you have used `loginctl enable-linger &lt;username&gt;` to enable the service to start for your user without logging in. 

Copy the `redlib.container` and `.env.example` files to `.config/containers/systemd/` and modify any relevant values (for example, the ports Redlib should listen on, renaming the .env file and editing its values, etc.).

To start Redlib either reboot or follow the instructions below:

Notify systemd of the new files
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Start the newly generated service file

```bash
systemctl --user start redlib.service
```

You can check the status of your container by using the following command:
```bash 
systemctl --user status redlib.service
```

## Binary

If you&#039;re on Linux, you can grab a binary from [the newest release](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/releases/latest) from GitHub.

Download the binary using [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/):

```bash
wget https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/releases/download/v0.31.0/redlib
```

Make the binary executable and change its ownership to `root`:

```bash
sudo chmod +x redlib &amp;&amp; sudo chown root:root redlib
```

Copy the binary to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
sudo cp ./redlib /usr/bin/redlib
```

Deploy Redlib to `0.0.0.0:8080`:

```bash
redlib
```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re proxying Redlib through NGINX (see [issue #122](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit/issues/122#issuecomment-782226853)), add
&gt;
&gt; ```nginx
&gt; proxy_http_version 1.1;
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; to your NGINX configuration file above your `proxy_pass` line.

### Running as a systemd service

You can use the systemd service available in `contrib/redlib.service`
(install it on `/etc/systemd/system/redlib.service`).

That service can be optionally configured in terms of environment variables by
creating a file in `/etc/redlib.conf`. Use the `contrib/redlib.conf` as a
template. You can also add the `REDLIB_DEFAULT__{X}` settings explained
above.

When &quot;Proxying using NGINX&quot; where the proxy is on the same machine, you should
guarantee nginx waits for this service to start. Edit
`/etc/systemd/system/redlib.service.d/reverse-proxy.conf`:

```conf
[Unit]
Before=nginx.service
```

## Building from source

To deploy Redlib with changes not yet included in the latest release, you can build the application from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib &amp;&amp; cd redlib
cargo run
```

## Replit/Heroku

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; These are free hosting options, but they are _not_ private and will monitor server usage to prevent abuse. If you need a free and easy setup, this method may work best for you.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://repl.it/github/redlib-org/redlib&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://repl.it/badge/github/redlib-org/redlib&quot; alt=&quot;Run on Repl.it&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib)

## launchd (macOS)

If you are on macOS, you can use the [launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) service available in `contrib/redlib.plist`.

Install it with `cp contrib/redlib.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

Load and start it with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/redlib.plist`.

&lt;!-- ## Cargo

Make sure Rust stable is installed along with `cargo`, Rust&#039;s package manager.

```bash
cargo install libreddit
``` --&gt;

&lt;!-- ## AUR

For ArchLinux users, Redlib is available from the AUR as [`libreddit-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libreddit-git).

```bash
yay -S libreddit-git
```
## NetBSD/pkgsrc

For NetBSD users, Redlib is available from the official repositories.

```bash
pkgin install libreddit
```

Or, if you prefer to build from source

```bash
cd /usr/pkgsrc/libreddit
make install
``` --&gt;

---

# Configuration

You can configure Redlib further using environment variables. For example:

```bash
REDLIB_DEFAULT_SHOW_NSFW=on redlib
```

```bash
REDLIB_DEFAULT_WIDE=on REDLIB_DEFAULT_THEME=dark redlib -r
```

You can also configure Redlib with a configuration file named `redlib.toml`. For example:

```toml
REDLIB_DEFAULT_WIDE = &quot;on&quot;
REDLIB_DEFAULT_USE_HLS = &quot;on&quot;
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you&#039;re deploying Redlib using the **Docker CLI or Docker Compose**, environment variables can be defined in a [`.env` file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/), allowing you to centralize and manage configuration in one place.
&gt;
&gt; To configure Redlib using a `.env` file, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit it accordingly.
&gt;
&gt; If using the Docker CLI, add ` --env-file .env` to the command that runs Redlib. For example:
&gt;
&gt; ```bash
&gt; docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env quay.io/redlib/redlib:latest
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; If using Docker Compose, no changes are needed as the `.env` file is already referenced in `compose.yaml` via the `env_file: .env` line.

## Command Line Flags

Redlib supports the following command line flags:

- `-4`, `--ipv4-only`: Listen on IPv4 only.
- `-6`, `--ipv6-only`: Listen on IPv6 only.
- `-r`, `--redirect-https`: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS (no longer functional).
- `-a`, `--address &lt;ADDRESS&gt;`: Sets address to listen on. Default is `[::]`.
- `-p`, `--port &lt;PORT&gt;`: Port to listen on. Default is `8080`.
- `-H`, `--hsts &lt;EXPIRE_TIME&gt;`: HSTS header to tell browsers that this site should only be accessed over HTTPS. Default is `604800`.

## Instance settings

Assign a default value for each instance-specific setting by passing environment variables to Redlib in the format `REDLIB_{X}`. Replace `{X}` with the setting name (see list below) in capital letters.

| Name                      | Possible values | Default value          | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------       | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SFW_ONLY`                | `[&quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;]` | `off`                  | Enables SFW-only mode for the instance, i.e. all NSFW content is filtered.                                |
| `BANNER`                  | String          | (empty)                | Allows the server to set a banner to be displayed. Currently this is displayed on the instance info page. |
| `ROBOTS_DISABLE_INDEXING` | `[&quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;]` | `off`                  | Disables indexing of the instance by search engines.                                                      |

## Installation

By default, the application&#039;s installed binary is `spotify_player`.

### Requirements

A Spotify Premium account is **required**.

#### Dependencies

##### Windows and MacOS

- [Rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) as the build dependencies

##### Linux

- [Rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) as the build dependencies
- install `openssl`, `alsa-lib` (`streaming` feature), `libdbus` (`media-control` feature).

  - For example, on Debian based systems, run the below command to install application&#039;s dependencies:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install libssl-dev libasound2-dev libdbus-1-dev
    ```
  - On RHEL/Fedora based systems, run the below command to install application&#039;s dependencies :

    ```shell
    sudo dnf install openssl-devel alsa-lib-devel dbus-devel
    ```
    or if you&#039;re using `yum`:
    ```shell
    sudo yum install openssl-devel alsa-lib-devel dbus-devel
    ```

### Binaries

Application&#039;s prebuilt binaries can be found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/releases).

**Note**: to run the application, Linux systems need to install additional dependencies as specified in the [Dependencies section](#linux).

### Homebrew

Run `brew install spotify_player` to install the application.

### Scoop

Run `scoop install spotify-player` to install the application.

### Cargo

Run `cargo install spotify_player --locked` to install the application from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/spotify_player).

### Arch Linux

Run `pacman -S spotify-player` to install the application.

Alternatively, run `yay -S spotify-player-full` to install an AUR package compiled with full feature support and Pulseaudio/Pipewire instead of rodio.

### Void Linux

Run `xbps-install -S spotify-player` to install the application.

### FreeBSD

Run `pkg install spotify-player` to install the `spotify_player` binary from FreeBSD ports.

### NetBSD

Using the package manager, run `pkgin install spotify-player` to install from the official repositories.

Building from source,

```
cd /usr/pkgsrc/audio/spotify-player
make install
```

### NixOS

[spotify-player](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=spotify-player&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;type=packages&amp;query=spotify-player) is available as a Nix package and can be installed via `nix-shell -p spotify-player` or as part of your system configuration.

If you want to build the source locally you can run `nix-shell` in the root of a checkout of the source code. The provided `shell.nix` file will install the build prerequisites.

### Docker

**Note**: [streaming](#streaming) feature is disabled when using the docker image.

You can download the binary image of the latest build from the `master` branch by running

```
docker pull aome510/spotify_player:latest
```

then run

```
docker run --rm -it aome510/spotify_player:latest
```

to run the application.

You can also use your local config folder to configure the application or your local cache folder to store the application&#039;s cache data when running the docker image:

```
docker run --rm \
-v $APP_CONFIG_FOLDER:/app/config/ \
-v $APP_CACHE_FOLDER:/app/cache/ \
-it aome510/spotify_player:latest
```

## Features

### Spotify Connect

To enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, user will need to register a Spotify application and specify the application&#039;s `client_id` in the general configuration file as described in the [configuration documentation](docs/config.md#general).

More details about registering a Spotify application can be found in the [official Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).

When `spotify_player` runs with your own `client_id`, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.

### Streaming

`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.

The application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](#spotify-connect) device list.

#### Audio backend

`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:

- `alsa-backend`
- `pulseaudio-backend`
- `rodio-backend`
- `portaudio-backend`
- `jackaudio-backend`
- `rodiojack-backend`
- `sdl-backend`
- `gstreamer-backend`

User can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend
```

**Note**:

- needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.
- user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).

The `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features
```

### Media Control

To enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#media-control).

Media control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.

### Image

To enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features image
```

`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).

`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features sixel
```

**Notes**:

- Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).
- Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It&#039;s recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.

Examples of image rendering:

- iTerm2:

![iTerm2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172966798-0aadc431-b0c3-4433-adf3-7526684fc2a0.png)

- Sixel (`foot` terminal, `cover_img_scale=1.8`):

### Notify

To enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features notify
```

**Note**: the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.

### Mouse support

Currently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback&#039;s progress bar.

### Daemon

To enable a [daemon](&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)&gt;) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features daemon
```

You can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.

**Notes**:

- `daemon` feature is not supported on Windows
- `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](#audio-backend)
- because of the OS&#039;s restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn&#039;t work with the `media-control` feature on MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled**:

  ```shell
  cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend
  ```

### Fuzzy search

To enable [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `fzf` feature (**disabled** by default).

### CLI Commands

`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with Spotify:

- `get`: Get Spotify data (playlist/album/artist data, user&#039;s data, etc)
- `playback`: Interact with the playback (start a playback, play-pause, next, etc)
- `search`: Search spotify
- `connect`: Connect to a Spotify device
- `like`: Like currently playing track
- `authenticate`: Authenticate the application
- `playlist`: Playlist editing (new, delete, import, fork, etc)

For more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.

**Notes**

- When using the CLI for the first time, you&#039;ll need to run `spotify_player authenticate` to authenticate the application beforehand.
- Under the hood, CLI command is handled by sending requests to a `spotify_player` client socket running on port `client_port`, [a general application configuration](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#general) with a default value of `8080`. If there is no running application&#039;s instance, a new client will be created upon handling the CLI commands, which increases the latency of the command.

#### Scripting

The `spotify_player` command-line interface makes scripting easy.
With the `search` subcommand, you can search Spotify and retrieve data in JSON format, enabling queries with tools like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

Here’s an example of starting playback for the first track from a search query:

```sh
read -p &quot;Search spotify: &quot; query
spotify_player playback start track --id $(spotify_player search &quot;$query&quot; | jq &#039;.tracks.[0].id&#039; | xargs)
```

## Commands

To go to the shortcut help page, press `?` or `C-h` (default shortcuts for `OpenCommandHelp` command).

**Tips**:

- you can search in the shortcut help page (and some other pages) using `Search` command
- `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.
- `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.

## About The Project

| Desktop                                                                                                         | Mobile                                                                                                      |

[Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) is similar to sites like [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): you subscribe to forums you&#039;re interested in, post links and discussions, then vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), and connected to the same universe, called the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

For a link aggregator, this means a user registered on one server can subscribe to forums on any other server, and can have discussions with users registered elsewhere.

It is an easily self-hostable, decentralized alternative to Reddit and other link aggregators, outside of their corporate control and meddling.

Each Lemmy server can set its own moderation policy; appointing site-wide admins, and community moderators to keep out the trolls, and foster a healthy, non-toxic environment where all can feel comfortable contributing.

RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.67.1 at February 7th 2023). If you don&#039;t
currently have Rust installed on your system you can do so by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

To check the version of Rust you&#039;re currently running, use `rustc --version`. If you wish to update,
`rustup update stable` will update your Rust installation to the most recent stable release.

To build RustPython locally, first, clone the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
```

RustPython uses symlinks to manage python libraries in `Lib/`. If on windows, running the following helps:
```bash
git config core.symlinks true
```

Then you can change into the RustPython directory and run the demo (Note: `--release` is
needed to prevent stack overflow on Windows):

```bash
$ cd RustPython
$ cargo run --release demo_closures.py
Hello, RustPython!
```

Or use the interactive shell:

```bash
$ cargo run --release
Welcome to rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
```

NOTE: For windows users, please set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` environment variable as `Lib` path in project directory.
(e.g. When RustPython directory is `C:\RustPython`, set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` as `C:\RustPython\Lib`)

You can also install and run RustPython with the following:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython rustpython
$ rustpython
Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

If you&#039;d like to make https requests, you can enable the `ssl` feature, which
also lets you install the `pip` package manager. Note that on Windows, you may
need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead,
which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`.
OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work.

Once you&#039;ve installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by
running:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython --features ssl
rustpython --install-pip
```

You can also install RustPython through the `conda` package manager, though
this isn&#039;t officially supported and may be out of date:

```bash
conda install rustpython -c conda-forge
rustpython
```

### WASI

You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere.

Build

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --no-default-features --features freeze-stdlib,stdlib --release
```

Run by wasmer

```bash
wasmer run --dir `pwd` -- target/wasm32-wasip1/release/rustpython.wasm `pwd`/extra_tests/snippets/stdlib_random.py
```

Run by wapm

```bash
$ wapm install rustpython
$ wapm run rustpython
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
```

#### Building the WASI file

You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with:

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 --features=&quot;freeze-stdlib&quot;
```

&gt; Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary. You also have to run once `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`.

### JIT (Just in time) compiler

RustPython has a **very** experimental JIT compiler that compile python functions into native code.

#### Building

By default the JIT compiler isn&#039;t enabled, it&#039;s enabled with the `jit` cargo feature.

```bash
cargo run --features jit
```

This requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and clang to be installed.

#### Using

To compile a function, call `__jit__()` on it.

```python
def foo():
    a = 5
    return 10 + a

foo.__jit__()  # this will compile foo to native code and subsequent calls will execute that native code
assert foo() == 15
```

## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications

Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust,
perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust&#039;s compile times would be inhibitive?
Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance.

## Disclaimer

RustPython is in development, and while the interpreter certainly can be used
in interesting use cases like running Python in WASM and embedding into a Rust
project, do note that RustPython is not totally production-ready.

Contribution is more than welcome! See our contribution section for more
information on this.

## Conference videos

Checkout those talks on conferences:

- [FOSDEM 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJDY9ASuiLc)
- [EuroPython 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmio0JHy_Y)

## Use cases

Although RustPython is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to
make cool projects:

- [GreptimeDB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb): an open-source, cloud-native, distributed time-series database. Using RustPython for embedded scripting.
- [pyckitup](https://github.com/pickitup247/pyckitup): a game engine written in
  rust.
- [Robot Rumble](https://github.com/robot-rumble/logic/): an arena-based AI competition platform
- [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/): an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust

## Goals

- Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)
- A clean implementation without compatibility hacks

## Documentation

Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an
early phase.

You can read the [online documentation](https://docs.rs/rustpython) for the
latest release, or the [user guide](https://rustpython.github.io/docs/).

You can also generate documentation locally by running:

```shell
cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies
cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies
```

Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory or you can append `--open` to the previous commands to
have the documentation open automatically on your default browser.

For a high level overview of the components, see the [architecture](architecture/architecture.md) document.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide
contributors through PRs or on Discord. Please refer to the
[development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments.

With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of
the best ways to get started are below:

Most tasks are listed in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues). Check issues
labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) if you wish to start coding.

To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest](https://rustpython.github.io/guideline/2020/04/04/how-to-contribute-by-cpython-unittest.html)

Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object
methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.

You can also simply run `python -I whats_left.py` to assist in finding any unimplemented
method.

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it&#039;s a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB&#039;s Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git&#039;s user interface hasn&#039;t been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed
- **Easy Commit Management**
  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping
- **Undo Timeline**
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation
- **GitHub Integration**
  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more
- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

## Example Uses

### Fixing a Bug While Working on a Feature

&gt; Say that while developing a feature, you encounter a bug that you wish to fix. It&#039;s often desirable that you ship the fix as a separate contribution (Pull request).

Using Git you can stash your changes and switch to another branch, where you can commit, and push your fix.

_With GitButler_ you simply assign your fix to a separate virtual branch, which you can individually push (or directly create a PR). An additional benefit is that you can retain the fix in your working directory while waiting for CI and/or code review.

### Trying Someone Else&#039;s Branch Together With My Work in Progress

&gt; Say you want to test a branch from someone else for the purpose of code review.

Using Git trying out someone else&#039;s branch is a full context switch away from your own work.
_With GitButler_ you can apply and unapply (add / remove) any remote branch directly into your working directory.

## Documentation

You can find our end user documentation at: https://docs.gitbutler.com

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),
or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## AI Commit Message Generation

Commit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.

Currently, GitButler uses OpenAI&#039;s API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI&#039;s servers.

Our goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).
