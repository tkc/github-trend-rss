**The vector database that gets smarter the more you use it — and now ships as a cognitive container.**

```bash
npx ruvector
```

Most vector databases are static — they store embeddings and search them. That&#039;s it. RuVector is different: it learns from every query, runs LLMs locally, scales horizontally, boots as a Linux microservice from a single file, and costs nothing to operate.

| | Pinecone/Weaviate | RuVector |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 **Search improves over time** | ❌ | ✅ The more you search, the better results get |
| 🤖 **Run LLMs locally** | ❌ | ✅ Run AI models on your own machine for free |
| 🔗 **Graph queries** | ❌ | ✅ Ask questions about relationships between data |
| 📚 **Self-learning** | ❌ | ✅ System watches what works and gets smarter |
| 🚀 **Self-booting microservice** | ❌ | ✅ [One file boots into a running service](./crates/rvf/README.md) in 125 ms |
| ⚡ **Real-time graph updates** | ❌ Must rebuild | ✅ Update connections instantly, no downtime |
| 📦 **Single-file deployment** | ❌ Server required | ✅ One file — copy it anywhere and it just works |
| 🔐 **Tamper-proof audit trail** | ❌ | ✅ Every operation is cryptographically recorded |
| 🌐 **Works offline** | ❌ | ✅ Runs in browsers, phones, IoT, and bare metal |
| 💰 **Cost** | Per-query pricing | ✅ Free forever — open source (MIT) |
| 📈 **Scales horizontally** | 💰 Paid tiers | ✅ Add nodes freely, no per-vector fees |
| 🌿 **Git-like branching** | ❌ | ✅ Branch your data like code — only changes are copied |
| ⚡ **Sublinear Solvers** | ❌ | ✅ O(log n) sparse linear systems, PageRank, spectral methods |

**One package. Everything included:** vector search, graph queries, GNN learning, distributed clustering, local LLMs, 46 attention mechanisms, cognitive containers ([RVF](./crates/rvf/README.md) — self-booting `.rvf` files with eBPF, witness chains, and COW branching), and WASM support.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RVF Cognitive Containers&lt;/strong&gt; — One file that stores, boots, and proves everything&lt;/summary&gt;

**[RVF (RuVector Format)](./crates/rvf/README.md)** is a universal binary substrate that merges database, model, graph engine, kernel, and attestation into a single deployable file. A `.rvf` file can store vector embeddings, carry LoRA adapter deltas, embed GNN graph state, include a bootable Linux microkernel, run queries in a 5.5 KB WASM runtime, and prove every operation through a cryptographic witness chain — all in one file that runs anywhere from a browser to bare metal.

This is not a database format. It is an **executable knowledge unit**.

```bash
cargo install rvf-cli                          # CLI tool
cargo add rvf-runtime                          # Rust library
npm install @ruvector/rvf                      # TypeScript SDK
npx @ruvector/rvf-mcp-server --transport stdio # MCP server for AI agents
```

| What It Does | How |
|---|---|
| Self-boot as a microservice | Real Linux kernel in the file, boots in 125 ms on QEMU/KVM |
| Hardware-speed lookups | eBPF programs (XDP, TC, socket filter) bypass userspace entirely |
| Run in any browser | 5.5 KB WASM runtime, zero backend |
| Git-like branching | COW at cluster granularity — 1M vectors, 100 edits = ~2.5 MB child |
| Tamper-evident audit | Hash-linked witness chain for every insert, query, and deletion |
| Post-quantum signatures | ML-DSA-65 and Ed25519 signing on every segment |
| DNA-style lineage | Parent/child derivation chains with cryptographic verification |
| 24 segment types | VEC, INDEX, KERNEL, EBPF, WASM, COW_MAP, WITNESS, CRYPTO, and 16 more |

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sublinear-Time Solver&lt;/strong&gt; — O(log n) sparse linear systems for graph analytics and AI&lt;/summary&gt;

**[ruvector-solver](./crates/ruvector-solver/README.md)** provides 8 iterative algorithms for sparse linear systems, achieving O(log n) to O(√n) complexity — orders of magnitude faster than dense O(n³) solvers. Powers Prime Radiant coherence, GNN message passing, spectral methods, and PageRank computation.

```bash
cargo add ruvector-solver --features all-algorithms
```

| Algorithm | Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Neumann Series** | O(k · nnz) | Diagonally dominant, fast convergence |
| **Conjugate Gradient** | O(√κ · log(1/ε) · nnz) | Gold-standard SPD solver |

| **TRUE** | O(log n) amortized | Large-scale Laplacian systems |
| **BMSSP** | O(nnz · log n) | Multigrid hierarchical solve |
| **Auto Router** | Automatic | Selects optimal algorithm |

**Key optimizations**: AVX2 SIMD SpMV, fused residual kernels, bounds-check elimination, arena allocator

## How the GNN Works

Traditional vector search:
```
Query → HNSW Index → Top K Results
```

RuVector with GNN:
```
Query → HNSW Index → GNN Layer → Enhanced Results
                ↑                      │
                └──── learns from ─────┘
```

The GNN layer:
1. Takes your query and its nearest neighbors
2. Applies multi-head attention to weigh which neighbors matter
3. Updates representations based on graph structure
4. Returns better-ranked results

Over time, frequently-accessed paths get reinforced, making common queries faster and more accurate.

## ⚓ Oxc

_/oʊ ɛks siː/_

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Oxc is part of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/)&#039;s vision for a unified, high-performance toolchain for JavaScript. It powers [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) ([Vite]&#039;s future bundler) and enables the next generation of ultra-fast development tools that work seamlessly together.

For more information, check out our website at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs).

&lt;sub&gt;\* Oxidation is the chemical process that creates rust&lt;/sub&gt;

## 🏗️ Design Principles

- **Performance**: Through rigorous performance engineering.
- **Correctness**: Through conformance testing to standards and similar projects.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and sensible configuration.
- **Modular composability**: Use individual components independently or compose them into complete toolchains.

Read more about our [architecture](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/parser.html) and [performance philosophy](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/performance).

## ⚡️ Quick Start

### Linter

The production-ready linter catches mistakes for you with sensible defaults and optional configuration:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds:

&lt;p float=&quot;left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

→ [oxlint documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/cli.html)

### Formatter

Fast, opinionated code formatter compatible with [Prettier]:

```bash
npx oxfmt@latest
```

→ [Formatter documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter)

### Parser (Node.js)

The fastest JavaScript/TypeScript parser written in Rust:

```bash
npm install oxc-parser
```

```js
import { parseSync } from &quot;oxc-parser&quot;;
const result = parseSync(&quot;const x = 1;&quot;);
```

→ [Parser documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/parser)

### Transformer (Node.js)

TypeScript, React, and modern JavaScript transformation:

```bash
npm install oxc-transform
```

```js
import { transform } from &quot;oxc-transform&quot;;
const result = transform(&quot;source.tsx&quot;, code, { typescript: true });
```

→ [Transformer documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/transformer)

### Minifier (Node.js)

High-performance JavaScript minifier:

```bash
npm install oxc-minify
```

```js
import { minify } from &quot;oxc-minify&quot;;
const result = minify(code, { mangle: true });
```

→ [Minifier documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/minifier)

### Rust

Individual crates are published for building your own JavaScript tools:

```toml
[dependencies]
oxc = &quot;0.x&quot;
```

ArtCraft
========
ArtCraft is the IDE for interactive AI image and video creation.
We turn prompting into *crafting*, so your ideas become a form of tangible expression and computing.
This is Adobe Photoshop for everyone, and we&#039;re giving away the source code!

## Show, Don&#039;t Tell: Advanced Crafting Features

Text-to-image is great, but artists *need control*. It&#039;s important to know what your image will look like before you generate it, and it&#039;s vitally important to achieve consistency and repeatability.

| Feature                           | Demo + Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image to Location**             | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f103e3-cc19-4882-a630-9caa1b76ae31) Placing virtual actors into physical environments establishes single-location consistency. You can film multiple shots within a room without having things disappear.         |
| **3D Image Compositing**          | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93a616f-571d-474e-bcc0-53736de7303d) Use images (backdrops, foreground elements, props, etc.) in scenes with depth and blend them naturally together. Just a couple of images usually leads to great compositions. |
| **2D Image Compositing**          | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f99391-e496-4c62-9e37-29734ba5f899) Use images, background removal, layers, and simple drawing tools to precisely compose a scene.                                                                                |
| **Image to 3D Mesh**              | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600a405c-e360-48c1-9b42-6e657ae6243b) It&#039;s almost impossible to lay out complicated objects or block complicated scenes; turning images into 3D helps position elements exactingly and intentionally.               |
| **Character Posing**              | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a8e983-7c8f-42d2-be8b-25296ab9ed57) You can dynamically pose your characters to achieve the precise character, scene, and camera blocking before calling &quot;action&quot;.                                                |
| **Scene Blocking w/ Kit Bashing** | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eef025ac-0346-4a46-a023-d48e23629eb5) Use 3D asset kits to precisely block out your scene: get the correct angles, object positions, and rich depth layering you can&#039;t with text prompting.                         |
| **Character Identity Transfer**   | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629119ee-8c76-4a83-9827-8c6c995a3ec1) Use mannequins as simple 3D ControlNets for posing any character.                                                                                                             |
| **Background Removal**            | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c65057-5531-404f-83af-b34e66e24ec1) Remove backgrounds from images to make them useful in 2D or 3D compositing. They can be props, layers, or backdrops.                                                          |
| **Mixed Asset Crafting**          | ![Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storytold/github-media/main/ship-editing.gif) You can use image cutouts, worlds, and simple 3D meshes all together to precisely and intentionally lay out your scenes.                                                       |
| **Scene Blocking**                | (preview coming soon)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Canvas Editing**                | (preview coming soon)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Scene Relighting**              | (preview coming soon)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We&#039;re going to be adding the following providers soon: Kling (via Kling website accounts), Google (via API keys), 
Runway (via website account), Luma (via website account).

We&#039;re potentially interested in adding other aggregators for those who already have subscriptions and credits at 
those providers, for example: OpenArt, FreePik, etc.

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX
```

Enable logs for user applications:

```bash
export LINERA_APPLICATION_LOGS=true
```

Set the path of the future wallet:

```bash
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$ACCOUNT1@$CHAIN1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$ACCOUNT1@$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$ACCOUNT2@$CHAIN2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$ACCOUNT1@$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$ACCOUNT2@$CHAIN2&quot;
```

More complex examples may be found in our [developer manual](https://linera.dev) as well
as the [example applications](./examples) in this repository.

Open-source, cross-platform, and feature rich iOS sideloading application. Supporting macOS, Linux[^1], and Windows[^2].

[^1]: On Linux, usbmuxd must be installed on your system. Don&#039;t worry though, it comes with most popular distributions by default already! However, due to some distributions [udev](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) rules `usbmuxd` may stop running after no devices are connected causing Impactor to not detect the device after plugging it in. You can mitigate this by plugging your phone first then restarting the app. \
\
Auto-refresh will not work the same as it would on other platforms like macOS/Windows, due to `usbmuxd` lacking WiFi connectivity so it will attempt to do it automatically only when a device is plugged in, we are looking for a proper solution though.\
\
Some distributions (like Bazzite) may need you to run `sudo update-crypto-policies` so `usbmuxd` ends up detecting the device again.

[^2]: On Windows, [iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106372) must be downloaded so Impactor is able to use the drivers for interacting with Apple devices.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

**macOS:**

```sh
brew install --cask impactor
```

## How it works

How it works is that we try to replicate what [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) would do but in our own application, by using your Apple Account (which serves the purpose of being a &quot;Developer&quot;) so we can request certificates, provisioning profiles, and register your device from Apple themselves. 

Apple here is the provider of these and how we&#039;ll even be able to get apps on your phone. Unfortunately, without paying for their developer program you are limited to 7-days and a limited amount of apps/components you can register.

The very first thing we do when trying to sideload an app, is register your idevice to their servers, then try to create a certificate. These last 365 days, we also store the key locally so you would need to copy these keys over to other machines, if you don&#039;t, Impactor will try to make a new one.

After that, we try to register your app that you&#039;re trying to sideload, and try to provision it with proper entitlements gathered from the binary. Once we do, we have to download the neccessary files when signing, that being the certificate and provisioning profile that we just created.

Lastly, we do all of the necessary modifications we need to the app you&#039;re trying to sideload, can range between tweaks, name changing, etc. Though most importantly, we need to *sign* the app using [apple-codesign-rs](https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs) so we can **install it** with [idevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice)!

That&#039;s the entire gist of how this works! Of course its very short and brief, however feel free to look how it works since its open source :D

### Pairing File

Impactor also allows the user to generate a pairing file for applications to talk directly to the device remotely. This pairing file is device specific and will become invalid if you ever re-trust/update/reset.

Supported apps for pairing file:
- [`SideStore`](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore): Uses your Apple ID to install iOS apps.
- [`Feather`](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather): Uses raw certificates to install iOS apps.
- [`SparseBox`](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/SparseBox): Device customizer.
- [`LiveContainer + SideStore`](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer) Uses your Apple ID to install iOS apps.
- [`Antrag`](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Antrag): List currently installed iOS apps.
- [`Protokolle`](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Protokolle): View logs from system processes.
- [`StikDebug`](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug): Enable JIT for iOS apps.
- [`EnsWilde`](https://github.com/YangJiiii/EnsWilde): Device customizer.
- [`ByeTunes`](https://github.com/EduAlexxis/ByeTunes): Import mp3 files to the Music App.

You can retrieve this file by either sideloading the supported app of your choice, or going to the `Utilities` page when a device is connected and press install for the supported app. Head over to the [downloads](https://github.com/khcrysalis/PlumeImpactor/releases).

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty).

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12 3.13 3.14
Installed 3 versions in 972ms
 + cpython-3.12.12-macos-aarch64-none (python3.12)
 + cpython-3.13.9-macos-aarch64-none (python3.13)
 + cpython-3.14.0-macos-aarch64-none (python3.14)

```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)

##  安装指南 (Installation)

### 选项 A: 终端安装 (推荐)

#### 跨平台一键安装脚本

自动检测操作系统、架构和包管理器，一条命令完成下载与安装。

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/v4.1.22/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

&gt; **支持的格式**: Linux (`.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage`) | macOS (`.dmg`) | Windows (NSIS `.exe`)
&gt;
&gt; **高级用法**: 安装指定版本 `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --version 4.1.22`，预览模式 `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --dry-run`

#### macOS - Homebrew
如果您已安装 [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)，也可以通过以下命令安装：

```bash
# 1. 订阅本仓库的 Tap
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager

# 2. 安装应用
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```
&gt; **提示**: 如果遇到权限问题，建议添加 `--no-quarantine` 参数。

#### Arch Linux
您可以选择通过一键安装脚本或 Homebrew 进行安装：

**方式 1：一键安装脚本 (推荐)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/deploy/arch/install.sh | bash
```

**方式 2：通过 Homebrew** (如果您已安装 [Linuxbrew](https://sh.brew.sh/))
```bash
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```

#### 其他 Linux 发行版
安装后会自动将 AppImage 添加到二进制路径并配置可执行权限。

### 选项 B: 手动下载
前往 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/releases) 下载对应系统的包：
*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (支持 Apple Silicon &amp; Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` 或 便携版 `.zip`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` 或 `AppImage`

### 选项 C: Docker 部署 (推荐用于 NAS/服务器)
如果您希望在容器化环境中运行，我们提供了原生的 Docker 镜像。该镜像内置了对 v4.0.2 原生 Headless 架构的支持，可自动托管前端静态资源，并通过浏览器直接进行管理。

```bash
# 方式 1: 直接运行 (推荐)
# - API_KEY: 必填。用于所有协议的 AI 请求鉴定。
# - WEB_PASSWORD: 可选。用于管理后台登录。若不设置则默认使用 API_KEY。
docker run -d --name antigravity-manager \
  -p 8045:8045 \
  -e API_KEY=sk-your-api-key \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD=your-login-password \
  -e ABV_MAX_BODY_SIZE=104857600 \
  -v ~/.antigravity_tools:/root/.antigravity_tools \
  lbjlaq/antigravity-manager:latest

# 忘记密钥？执行 docker logs antigravity-manager 或 grep -E &#039;&quot;api_key&quot;|&quot;admin_password&quot;&#039; ~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json

#### 🔐 鉴权逻辑说明
*   **场景 A：仅设置了 `API_KEY`**
    - **Web 登录**：使用 `API_KEY` 进入后台。
    - **API 调用**：使用 `API_KEY` 进行 AI 请求鉴权。
*   **场景 B：同时设置了 `API_KEY` 和 `WEB_PASSWORD` (推荐)**
    - **Web 登录**：**必须**使用 `WEB_PASSWORD`，使用 API Key 将被拒绝（更安全）。
    - **API 调用**：统一使用 `API_KEY`。这样您可以将 API Key 分发给成员，而保留密码仅供管理员使用。

#### 🆙 旧版本升级指引
如果您是从 v4.0.1 及更早版本升级，系统默认未设置 `WEB_PASSWORD`。您可以通过以下任一方式设置：
1.  **Web UI 界面 (推荐)**：使用原有 `API_KEY` 登录后，在 **API 反代设置** 页面手动设置并保存。新密码将持久化存储在 `gui_config.json` 中。
2.  **环境变量 (Docker)**：在启动容器时增加 `-e WEB_PASSWORD=您的新密码`。**注意：环境变量具有最高优先级，将覆盖 UI 中的任何修改。**
3.  **配置文件 (持久化)**：直接修改 `~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json`，在 `proxy` 对象中修改或添加 `&quot;admin_password&quot;: &quot;您的新密码&quot;` 字段。
    - *注：`WEB_PASSWORD` 是环境变量名，`admin_password` 是配置文件中的 JSON 键名。*

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **密码优先级逻辑 (Priority)**:
&gt; - **第一优先级 (环境变量)**: `ABV_WEB_PASSWORD` 或 `WEB_PASSWORD`。只要设置了环境变量，系统将始终使用它。
&gt; - **第二优先级 (配置文件)**: `gui_config.json` 中的 `admin_password` 字段。UI 的“保存”操作会更新此值。
&gt; - **保底回退 (向后兼容)**: 若上述均未设置，则回退使用 `API_KEY` 作为登录密码。

# 方式 2: 使用 Docker Compose
# 1. 进入项目的 docker 目录
cd docker
# 2. 启动服务
docker compose up -d
```
&gt; **访问地址**: `http://localhost:8045` (管理后台) | `http://localhost:8045/v1` (API Base)
&gt; **系统要求**:
&gt; - **内存**: 建议 **1GB** (最小 256MB)。

### 🛠️ 常见问题排查 (Troubleshooting)

#### macOS 提示“应用已损坏，无法打开”？
由于 macOS 的安全机制，非 App Store 下载的应用可能会触发此提示。您可以按照以下步骤快速修复：

1.  **命令行修复** (推荐):
    打开终端，执行以下命令：
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine &quot;/Applications/Antigravity Tools.app&quot;
    ```
2.  **Homebrew 安装技巧**:
    如果您使用 brew 安装，可以添加 `--no-quarantine` 参数来规避此问题：
    ```bash
    brew install --cask --no-quarantine antigravity-tools
    ```

## 🔌 快速接入示例

### 🔐 OAuth 授权流程（添加账号）
1. 打开“Accounts / 账号” → “添加账号” → “OAuth”。
2. 弹窗会在点击按钮前预生成授权链接；点击链接即可复制到系统剪贴板，然后用你希望的浏览器打开并完成授权。
3. 授权完成后浏览器会打开本地回调页并显示“✅ 授权成功!”。
4. 应用会自动继续完成授权并保存账号；如未自动完成，可点击“我已授权，继续”手动完成。

&gt; 提示：授权链接包含一次性回调端口，请始终使用弹窗里生成的最新链接；如果授权时应用未运行或弹窗已关闭，浏览器可能会提示 `localhost refused connection`。

### 如何接入 Claude Code CLI?
1.  启动 Antigravity，并在“API 反代”页面开启服务。
2.  在终端执行：
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045&quot;
claude
```

### 如何接入 OpenCode?
1.  进入 **API 反代**页面 → **外部 Providers** → 点击 **OpenCode Sync** 卡片。
2.  点击 **Sync** 按钮，将自动生成 `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` 配置文件：
    - 创建独立 provider `antigravity-manager`（不覆盖 google/anthropic 原生配置）
    - 可选：勾选 **Sync accounts** 导出 `antigravity-accounts.json`（plugin-compatible v3 格式），供 OpenCode 插件直接导入
3.  点击 **Clear Config** 可一键清除 Manager 配置并清理 legacy 残留；点击 **Restore** 可从备份恢复。
4.  Windows 用户路径为 `C:\Users\&lt;用户名&gt;\.config\opencode\`（与 `~/.config/opencode` 规则一致）。

**快速验证命令：**
```bash
# 测试 antigravity-manager provider（支持 --variant）
opencode run &quot;test&quot; --model antigravity-manager/claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking --variant high

# 若已安装 opencode-antigravity-auth 插件，验证 google provider 仍可独立工作
opencode run &quot;test&quot; --model google/antigravity-claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking --variant max
```

### 如何接入 Kilo Code?
1.  **协议选择**: 建议优先使用 **Gemini 协议**。
2.  **Base URL**: 填写 `http://127.0.0.1:8045`。
3.  **注意**: 
    - **OpenAI 协议限制**: Kilo Code 在使用 OpenAI 模式时，其请求路径会叠加产生 `/v1/chat/completions/responses` 这种非标准路径，导致 Antigravity 返回 404。因此请务必填入 Base URL 后选择 Gemini 模式。
    - **模型映射**: Kilo Code 中的模型名称可能与 Antigravity 默认设置不一致，如遇到无法连接，请在“模型映射”页面设置自定义映射，并查看**日志文件**进行调试。

### 如何在 Python 中使用?
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1&quot;
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-flash&quot;,
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;你好，请自我介绍&quot;}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 如何使用图片生成 (Imagen 3)?

#### 方式一：OpenAI Images API (推荐)
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=&quot;sk-antigravity&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1&quot;
)

# 生成图片
response = client.images.generate(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    prompt=&quot;一座未来主义风格的城市，赛博朋克，霓虹灯&quot;,
    size=&quot;1920x1080&quot;,      # 支持任意 WIDTHxHEIGHT 格式，自动计算宽高比
    quality=&quot;hd&quot;,          # &quot;standard&quot; | &quot;hd&quot; | &quot;medium&quot;
    n=1,
    response_format=&quot;b64_json&quot;
)

# 保存图片
import base64
image_data = base64.b64decode(response.data[0].b64_json)
with open(&quot;output.png&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:
    f.write(image_data)
```

**支持的参数**：
- **`size`**: 任意 `WIDTHxHEIGHT` 格式（如 `1280x720`, `1024x1024`, `1920x1080`），自动计算并映射到标准宽高比（21:9, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1）
- **`quality`**: 
  - `&quot;hd&quot;` → 4K 分辨率（高质量）
  - `&quot;medium&quot;` → 2K 分辨率（中等质量）
  - `&quot;standard&quot;` → 默认分辨率（标准质量）
- **`n`**: 生成图片数量（1-10）
- **`response_format`**: `&quot;b64_json&quot;` 或 `&quot;url&quot;`（Data URI）

#### 方式二：Chat API + 参数设置 (✨ 新增)

**所有协议**（OpenAI、Claude）的 Chat API 现在都支持直接传递 `size` 和 `quality` 参数：

```python
# OpenAI Chat API
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    size=&quot;1920x1080&quot;,      # ✅ 支持任意 WIDTHxHEIGHT 格式
    quality=&quot;hd&quot;,          # ✅ &quot;standard&quot; | &quot;hd&quot; | &quot;medium&quot;
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

```bash
# Claude Messages API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1/messages \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;x-api-key: sk-antigravity&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1280x720&quot;,
    &quot;quality&quot;: &quot;hd&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一只可爱的猫咪&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

```

**参数优先级**: `imageSize` 参数 &gt; `quality` 参数 &gt; 模型后缀

**✨ 新增 `imageSize` 参数支持**:

除了 `quality` 参数外,现在还支持直接使用 Gemini 原生的 `imageSize` 参数:

```python
# 使用 imageSize 参数(最高优先级)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    size=&quot;16:9&quot;,           # 宽高比
    imageSize=&quot;4K&quot;,        # ✨ 直接指定分辨率: &quot;1K&quot; | &quot;2K&quot; | &quot;4K&quot;
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

```bash
# Claude Messages API 也支持 imageSize
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1/messages \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;x-api-key: sk-antigravity&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gemini-3-pro-image&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1280x720&quot;,
    &quot;imageSize&quot;: &quot;4K&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一只可爱的猫咪&quot;}]
  }&#039;
```

**参数说明**:
- **`imageSize`**: 直接指定分辨率 (`&quot;1K&quot;` / `&quot;2K&quot;` / `&quot;4K&quot;`)
- **`quality`**: 通过质量等级推断分辨率 (`&quot;standard&quot;` → 1K, `&quot;medium&quot;` → 2K, `&quot;hd&quot;` → 4K)
- **优先级**: 如果同时指定 `imageSize` 和 `quality`,系统会优先使用 `imageSize`


#### 方式三：Chat 接口 + 模型后缀
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k&quot;,  # 格式：gemini-3-pro-image-[比例]-[质量]
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;一座未来主义风格的城市&quot;}]
)
```

**模型后缀说明**：
- **宽高比**: `-16-9`, `-9-16`, `-4-3`, `-3-4`, `-21-9`, `-1-1`
- **质量**: `-4k` (4K), `-2k` (2K), 不加后缀（标准）
- **示例**: `gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k` → 16:9 比例 + 4K 分辨率

#### 方式四：Cherry Studio 等客户端设置
在支持 OpenAI 协议的客户端（如 Cherry Studio）中，可以通过**模型设置**页面配置图片生成参数：

1. **进入模型设置**：选择 `gemini-3-pro-image` 模型
2. **配置参数**：
   - **Size (尺寸)**: 输入任意 `WIDTHxHEIGHT` 格式（如 `1920x1080`, `1024x1024`）
   - **Quality (质量)**: 选择 `standard` / `hd` / `medium`
   - **Number (数量)**: 设置生成图片数量（1-10）
3. **发送请求**：直接在对话框中输入图片描述即可

**参数映射规则**：
- `size: &quot;1920x1080&quot;` → 自动计算为 `16:9` 宽高比
- `quality: &quot;hd&quot;` → 映射为 `4K` 分辨率
- `quality: &quot;medium&quot;` → 映射为 `2K` 分辨率

        *   **[核心修复] 修复图像生成配额同步问题 (Issue #1995)**：
            *   **放宽模型过滤**：优化了配额抓取逻辑，增加了对 `image` / `imagen` 关键字的支持，确保图像模型的配额信息能正常同步。
            *   **即时刷新机制**：在图像生成成功后立即异步触发全局配额刷新，实现了 UI 侧剩余配额的实时反馈。
        *   **[核心修复] 修复 OpenAI 流式收集器工具调用合并 Bug (PR #1994)**：
            *   **ID 冲突校验**：在聚合流式片段时引入 ID 校验，防止多个工具调用因索引重叠而导致参数被错误拼接。
            *   **索引稳定性优化**：优化了流式输出中的索引分配逻辑，确保多轮数据传输下工具调用索引始终单向递增。
        *   **[核心优化] 极致拟真请求伪装 (Request Identity Camouflage)**:
            *   **动态版本伪装**: 实现了智能版本探测机制。Antigravity 现在会自动读取本地安装的真实版本号构建 User-Agent，彻底告别了硬编码的 &quot;1.0.0&quot; 时代。
            *   **Docker 环境兜底**: 针对无头模式（Docker/Linux Server），内置了“已知稳定版”指纹库。当无法检测到本地客户端时，自动伪装为最新稳定版客户端（如 v1.16.5），确保服务端看到的永远是合法的官方客户端。
            *   **全维度 Header 注入**: 补全了 `X-Client-Name`, `X-Client-Version`, `X-Machine-Id`, `X-VSCode-SessionId` 等关键指纹头，实现了从网络层到应用层的像素级伪装，进一步降低了 403 风控概率。
        *   **[核心功能] 后台自动刷新开关与设置热保存**:
            *   **独立开关**: 在设置页面新增了“后台自动刷新”的独立开关，允许用户更精细地控制后台任务。
            *   **配置热保存**: 实现了设置项（自动刷新、智能预热、配额保护）的热保存机制，无需手动点击保存按钮即可实时生效。
        *   **[逻辑优化] 智能预热与配额保护解耦**:
            *   **解除锁定**: 彻底移除了“额度保护”对“智能预热”的强制绑定。现在开启额度保护仅会强制开启“后台自动刷新”（用于检测配额），而不会强制启动预热请求。
            *   **[重要建议]**: 建议用户在当前版本暂时关闭“额度保护”和“后台自动刷新”功能，以避免因频繁请求导致的潜在问题。
    *   **v4.1.19 (2026-02-15)**:
        -   **[核心修复] 修复 Claude Code CLI 工具调用空文本块错误 (Fix #1974)**:
            -   **字段缺失修复**: 修复了 Claude Code CLI 在工具调用过程中，因发送空文本块 (`text: &quot;&quot;`) 导致上游 API 报错 `Field required` 的问题。
            -   **空值过滤**: 在协议转换层增加了对无效空文本块的自动过滤与清理

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

&gt; The Polkadot SDK repository provides all the components needed to start building on the
&gt; [Polkadot](https://polkadot.com/) network, a multi-chain blockchain platform that enables
&gt; different blockchains to interoperate and share information in a secure and scalable way.

&lt;/div&gt;

## ⚡ Quickstart
If you want to get an example node running quickly you can execute the following getting started script:

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/master/scripts/getting-started.sh | bash
```

## 👩🏽‍💻 Building

In order to build this project you need to install some dependencies, follow the instructions in [this guide](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk).

### 🎯 Build targets

When building full runtimes, the WASM builder takes care of all required configuration.  
For individual crates, however, there are a few caveats when targeting `no_std`.

#### WASM
Set `RUSTFLAGS=&quot;--cfg substrate_runtime&quot;` when building for WASM. See the
[WASM build](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/substrate/index.html#wasm-build)
in the Polkadot SDK Documentation.

#### PolkaVM
PolkaVM builds require some `riscv32` or `riscv64` target architecture.  
See the CI example: [RiscV-build](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/6de451a105ca0a5feb675a215d4e8de5207febf6/.github/workflows/build-misc.yml#L55).

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).

## How to Install

### Windows

After installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or higher), run the following command:

```sh
pip install -U pyxel
```

When installing Python using the official installer, make sure to check the `Add Python 3.x to PATH` option to enable the `pyxel` command.

### Mac

After installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run the following commands:

```sh
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install pyxel
```

To upgrade Pyxel after installation, run `pipx upgrade pyxel`.

### Linux

After installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or higher), run the following command:

```sh
pip install -U pyxel
```

If the previous command fails, consider building Pyxel from source by following the instructions in the [Makefile](Makefile).

### Web

The web version of Pyxel works on PCs, smartphones, and tablets with a compatible browser, without installing Python or Pyxel.

The easiest way to use it is through the online IDE [Pyxel Code Maker](https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/code-maker/).

For other usage patterns, such as embedding Pyxel apps on your own site, please refer to [this page](docs/pyxel-web-en.md).

### Try Examples

After installing Pyxel, you can copy the examples to the current directory with the following command:

```sh
pyxel copy_examples
```

The examples can be viewed and run in the browser from [this page](https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/examples/).

Locally, the examples can be executed with the following commands:

```sh
# Run example in examples directory
cd pyxel_examples
pyxel run 01_hello_pyxel.py

# Run app in examples/apps directory
cd apps
pyxel play 30sec_of_daylight.pyxapp
```

## How to Use

### Create Application

In your Python script, import Pyxel, set the window size with `init`, and start the application with `run`.

```python
import pyxel

pyxel.init(160, 120)

def update():
    if pyxel.btnp(pyxel.KEY_Q):
        pyxel.quit()

def draw():
    pyxel.cls(0)
    pyxel.rect(10, 10, 20, 20, 11)

pyxel.run(update, draw)
```

The arguments of the `run` function are the `update` function, which processes frame updates, and the `draw` function, which handles screen drawing.

In an actual application, it is recommended to wrap Pyxel code in a class, as shown below:

```python
import pyxel

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        pyxel.init(160, 120)
        self.x = 0
        pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

    def update(self):
        self.x = (self.x + 1) % pyxel.width

    def draw(self):
        pyxel.cls(0)
        pyxel.rect(self.x, 0, 8, 8, 9)

App()
```

For creating simple graphics without animation, you can use the `show` function to simplify your code.

```python
import pyxel

pyxel.init(120, 120)
pyxel.cls(1)
pyxel.circb(60, 60, 40, 7)
pyxel.show()
```

### Run Application

A created script can be executed using the `python` command:

```sh
python PYTHON_SCRIPT_FILE
```

It can also be run with the `pyxel run` command:

```sh
pyxel run PYTHON_SCRIPT_FILE
```

Additionally, the `pyxel watch` command monitors changes in a specified directory and automatically re-runs the program when changes are detected:

```sh
pyxel watch WATCH_DIR PYTHON_SCRIPT_FILE
```

Stop directory monitoring by pressing `Ctrl(Command)+C`.

### How to Create Resources

Pyxel Editor creates images and sounds used in a Pyxel application.

You can start Pyxel Editor with the following command:

```sh
pyxel edit PYXEL_RESOURCE_FILE
```

If the specified Pyxel resource file (.pyxres) exists, it will be loaded. If it does not exist, a new file with the specified name will be created. If the resource file is omitted, a new file named `my_resource.pyxres` will be created.

After starting Pyxel Editor, you can switch to another resource file by dragging and dropping it onto the editor.

The created resource file can be loaded using the `load` function.

Pyxel Editor has the following editing modes.

**Image Editor**

The mode for editing images in each **image bank**.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/examples/tools/image-editor.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/image_editor.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

You can drag and drop an image file (PNG/GIF/JPEG) into the image editor to load the image into the currently selected image bank.

**Tilemap Editor**

The mode for editing **tilemaps** that arrange images from the image banks in a tile pattern.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/examples/tools/tilemap-editor.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/tilemap_editor.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

Drag and drop a TMX file (Tiled Map File) onto the tilemap editor to load its layer 0 into the currently selected tilemap.

**Sound Editor**

The mode for editing **sounds** used for melodies and sound effects.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/examples/tools/sound-editor.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/sound_editor.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

**Music Editor**

The mode for editing **music tracks** in which the sounds are arranged in order of playback.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/examples/tools/music-editor.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/music_editor.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

### Other Resource Creation Methods

Pyxel images and tilemaps can also be created using the following methods:

- Create images or tilemaps from lists of strings with the `Image.set` or `Tilemap.set` functions
- Load palette-ready image files (PNG/GIF/JPEG) with the `Image.load` function

Pyxel sounds and music can also be created using the following method:

- Create them from strings with the `Sound.set` or `Music.set` functions

Refer to the API reference for the usage of these functions.

### How to Distribute Applications

Pyxel supports a cross-platform distribution format called a Pyxel application file.

Create a Pyxel application file (.pyxapp) with the `pyxel package` command:

```sh
pyxel package APP_DIR STARTUP_SCRIPT_FILE
```

If you need to include resources or additional modules, place them in the application directory.

Metadata can be displayed at runtime by specifying it in the following format within the startup script. Fields other than `title` and `author` are optional.

```python
# title: Pyxel Platformer
# author: Takashi Kitao
# desc: A Pyxel platformer example
# site: https://github.com/kitao/pyxel
# license: MIT
# version: 1.0
```

The created application file can be run using the `pyxel play` command:

```sh
pyxel play PYXEL_APP_FILE
```

A Pyxel application file can also be converted to an executable or an HTML file using the `pyxel app2exe` or `pyxel app2html` commands.

## API Reference

### System

- `width`, `height`&lt;br&gt;
  The width and height of the screen

- `frame_count`&lt;br&gt;
  The number of elapsed frames

- `init(width, height, [title], [fps], [quit_key], [display_scale], [capture_scale], [capture_sec])`&lt;br&gt;
  Initialize the Pyxel application with the screen size (`width`, `height`). The following options can be specified: the window title with `title`, the frame rate with `fps`, the key to quit the application with `quit_key`, the display scale with `display_scale`, the screen capture scale with `capture_scale`, and the maximum recording time of the screen capture video with `capture_sec`.&lt;br&gt;
  Example: `pyxel.init(160, 120, title=&quot;My Pyxel App&quot;, fps=60, quit_key=pyxel.KEY_NONE, capture_scale=3, capture_sec=0)`

- `run(update, draw)`&lt;br&gt;
  Start the Pyxel application and call the `update` function for frame update and the `draw` function for drawing.

- `show()`&lt;br&gt;
  Show the screen and wait until the `Esc` key is pressed.

- `flip()`&lt;br&gt;
  Refresh the screen by one frame. The application exits when the `Esc` key is pressed. This function is not available in the web version.

- `quit()`&lt;br&gt;
  Quit the Pyxel application.

- `reset()`&lt;br&gt;
  Reset the Pyxel application. Environment variables are preserved after reset.

### Resource

- `load(filename, [exclude_images], [exclude_tilemaps], [exclude_sounds], [exclude_musics])`&lt;br&gt;
  Load the resource file (.pyxres). If an option is set to `True`, the corresponding resource will be excluded from loading. If a palette file (.pyxpal) with the same name exists in the same location as the resource file, the palette display colors will also be updated. The palette file contains hexadecimal entries for the display colors (e.g. `1100ff`), separated by newlines. The palette file can also be used to change the colors displayed in Pyxel Editor.

- `user_data_dir(vendor_name, app_name)`&lt;br&gt;
  Return the user data directory created based on `vendor_name` and `app_name`. If the directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. It is used to store high scores, game progress, and similar data.&lt;br&gt;
  Example: `print(pyxel.user_data_dir(&quot;Takashi Kitao&quot;, &quot;Pyxel Shooter&quot;))`

### Input

- `mouse_x`, `mouse_y`&lt;br&gt;
  The current position of the mouse cursor

- `mouse_wheel`&lt;br&gt;
  The current value of the mouse wheel

- `btn(key)`&lt;br&gt;
  Return `True` if the `key` is pressed, otherwise return `False`. ([Key definition list](python/pyxel/__init__.pyi))

- `btnp(key, [hold], [repeat])`&lt;br&gt;
  Return `True` if the `key` is pressed in that frame, otherwise return `False`. If `hold` and `repeat` are specified, after the `key` has been held down for `hold` frames or more, `True` is returned every `repeat` frames.

- `btnr(key)`&lt;br&gt;
  Return `True` if the `key` is released in that frame, otherwise return `False`.

- `mouse(visible)`&lt;br&gt;
  Show the mouse cursor if `visible` is `True`, and hide it if `visible` is `False`. The cursor&#039;s position continues to update even when it is hidden.

### Graphics

- `colors`&lt;br&gt;
  List of the palette display colors. The display color is specified by a 24-bit numerical value. It can be manipulated like a Python list to add, remove, or bulk-replace colors.&lt;br&gt;
  Example: `old_colors = list(pyxel.colors); pyxel.colors[:] = [0x111111, 0x222222, 0x333333]; pyxel.colors[15] = 0x112233`

Lance is an open lakehouse format for multimodal AI. It contains a file format, table format, and catalog spec that allows you to build a complete lakehouse on top of object storage to power your AI workflows. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores with hybrid search capabilities.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and random access.
3. Storing, querying, and managing multimodal data including images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings.

The key features of Lance include:

* **Expressive hybrid search:** Combine vector similarity search, full-text search (BM25), and SQL analytics on the same dataset with accelerated secondary indices.

* **Lightning-fast random access:** 100x faster than Parquet or Iceberg for random access without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Native multimodal data support:** Store images, videos, audio, text, and embeddings in a single unified format with efficient blob encoding and lazy loading.

* **Data evolution:** Efficiently add columns with backfilled values without full table rewrites, perfect for ML feature engineering.

* **Zero-copy versioning:** Automatic versioning with ACID transactions, time travel, tags, and branches—no extra infrastructure needed.

* **Rich ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Apache Spark, Ray, Trino, Apache Flink, and open catalogs (Apache Polaris, Unity Catalog, Apache Gravitino).

For more details, see the full [Lance format specification](https://lance.org/format).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lance.org/community/contributing/) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lance-format/pylance
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; For versions prior to 1.0.0-beta.4, you can find them at https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/pylance

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## Directory structure

| Directory          | Description              |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| [rust](./rust)     | Core Rust implementation |
| [python](./python) | Python bindings (PyO3)   |
| [java](./java)     | Java bindings (JNI)      |
| [docs](./docs)     | Documentation source     |

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

Traditional lakehouse formats were designed for SQL analytics and struggle with AI/ML workloads that require:
- **Vector search** for similarity and semantic retrieval
- **Fast random access** for sampling and interactive exploration
- **Multimodal data** storage (images, videos, audio alongside embeddings)
- **Data evolution** for feature engineering without full table rewrites
- **Hybrid search** combining vectors, full-text, and SQL predicates

While existing formats (Parquet, Iceberg, Delta Lake) excel at SQL analytics, they require additional specialized systems for AI capabilities. Lance brings these AI-first features directly into the lakehouse format.

A comparison of different formats across ML development stages:

|                     | Lance | Parquet &amp; ORC | JSON &amp; XML | TFRecord | Database | Warehouse |
|---------------------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Analytics           | Fast  | Fast          | Slow       | Slow     | Decent   | Fast      |
| Feature Engineering | Fast  | Fast          | Decent     | Slow     | Decent   | Good      |
| Training            | Fast  | Decent        | Slow       | Fast     | N/A      | N/A       |
| Exploration         | Fast  | Slow          | Fast       | Slow     | Fast     | Decent    |

- API key field: `env.ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- MCP servers: `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers`

**Codex**

- Live config: `~/.codex/auth.json` (required) + `config.toml` (optional)
- API key field: `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `auth.json`
- MCP servers: `~/.codex/config.toml` → `[mcp_servers]` tables

**Gemini**

- Live config: `~/.gemini/.env` (API key) + `~/.gemini/settings.json` (auth mode)

2. Choose your cloud sync folder (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)
3. Restart app to apply
4. Repeat on other devices to enable cross-device sync

&gt; **Note**: First launch auto-imports existing Claude/Codex configs as default provider.

```

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://x.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we&#039;ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out. Note: OP-Reth has moved to [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:

- We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
  - Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
  - Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://x.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
- We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024, the last beta release.
- We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
- We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
- We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and we do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth documentation](https://reth.rs/) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://reth.rs/docs/).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.93.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/22/Rust-1.93.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://reth.rs/installation/source/).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].

If the answer is not there:

- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or
- Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug.yml)

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

__Cube Core is an open-source semantic layer.__ Cube Core can be used to build embedded analytics in your applications, create your own business intelligence tool or provide context about data to AI agents. Cube Core is headless and comes with multiple APIs for embedded analytics and BI: REST, GraphQL, and SQL.

If you are looking for a fully integrated platform, check out [Cube](https://cube.dev), a modern AI-first business intelligence platform. We use Cube Core to power it.

  &lt;i&gt;Learn more about connecting Cube to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases?ref=github-readme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data sources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream?ref=github-readme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analytics &amp; visualization tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Cube Core was designed to work with all SQL data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery; query engines like Presto and Amazon Athena; and application databases like Postgres. Cube Core has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

## Why Cube Core?

Every business intelligence tool relies on a semantic layer as its core engine—a critical component that defines metrics, dimensions, and business logic while abstracting the complexity of underlying data sources. However, most semantic layers are proprietary, tightly coupled to specific BI platforms, and cannot be reused across different applications.

Cube Core is an open-source project that aims to create an open, modern semantic layer that can be used to power any analytics applications and AI agents. By decoupling the semantic layer from specific tools and making it accessible through standard APIs, Cube Core enables organizations to define their metrics once and use them everywhere—from BI tools to embedded analytics to AI agents.

## Getting Started 🚀

You can get started with Cube locally or self-host it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Once Docker is installed, in a new folder for your project, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -p 15432:15432 \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \
  cubejs/cube
```

Then, open http://localhost:4000 in your browser to continue setup.

For a step-by-step guide, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker?ref=github-readme).

# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Why Dynamo

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/assets/img/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi Node Multi-GPU topology&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Large language models exceed single-GPU capacity. Tensor parallelism spreads layers across GPUs but creates coordination challenges. Dynamo closes this orchestration gap.

Dynamo is inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang) and provides:

- **Disaggregated Prefill &amp; Decode** – Maximizes GPU throughput with latency/throughput trade-offs
- **Dynamic GPU Scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-Aware Request Routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated Data Transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL
- **KV Cache Offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher throughput

Built in Rust for performance and Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source with an OSS-first development approach.

## Backend Feature Support

| | [SGLang](docs/pages/backends/sglang/README.md) | [TensorRT-LLM](docs/pages/backends/trtllm/README.md) | [vLLM](docs/pages/backends/vllm/README.md) |

# Local Quick Start

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/pages/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/pages/reference/support-matrix.md)

## Install Dynamo

### Option A: Containers (Recommended)

Containers have all dependencies pre-installed. No setup required.

```bash
# SGLang
docker run --gpus all --network host --rm -it nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/sglang-runtime:0.8.1

# TensorRT-LLM
docker run --gpus all --network host --rm -it nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/tensorrtllm-runtime:0.8.1

# vLLM
docker run --gpus all --network host --rm -it nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/vllm-runtime:0.8.1
```

&gt; **Tip:** To run frontend and worker in the same container, either run processes in background with `&amp;` (see below), or open a second terminal and use `docker exec -it &lt;container_id&gt; bash`.

See [Release Artifacts](docs/pages/reference/release-artifacts.md#container-images) for available versions.

### Option B: Install from PyPI

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works.

```bash
# Install uv (recommended Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip
```

Install system dependencies and the Dynamo wheel for your chosen backend:

**SGLang**

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[sglang]&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** For CUDA 13 (B300/GB300), the container is recommended. See [SGLang install docs](https://docs.sglang.io/get_started/install.html) for details.

**TensorRT-LLM**

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
pip install torch==2.9.0 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com &quot;ai-dynamo[trtllm]&quot;
```

&gt; **Note:** TensorRT-LLM requires `pip` due to a transitive Git URL dependency that `uv` doesn&#039;t resolve. We recommend using the [TensorRT-LLM container](docs/pages/reference/release-artifacts.md#container-images) for broader compatibility.

**vLLM**

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev libxcb1
uv pip install &quot;ai-dynamo[vllm]&quot;
```

## Run Dynamo

&gt; **Tip (Optional):** Before running Dynamo, verify your system configuration with `python3 deploy/sanity_check.py`

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

Start the frontend:

&gt; **Tip:** To run in a single terminal (useful in containers), append `&gt; logfile.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;` to run processes in background. Example: `python3 -m dynamo.frontend --discovery-backend file &gt; dynamo.frontend.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;`

```bash
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server with prompt templating, tokenization, and routing.
# For local dev: --discovery-backend file avoids etcd (workers and frontend must share a disk)
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 --discovery-backend file
```

In another terminal (or same terminal if using background mode), start a worker for your chosen backend:

```bash
# SGLang
python3 -m dynamo.sglang --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --discovery-backend file

# TensorRT-LLM
python3 -m dynamo.trtllm --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --discovery-backend file

# vLLM (note: uses --model, not --model-path)
python3 -m dynamo.vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --discovery-backend file \
  --kv-events-config &#039;{&quot;enable_kv_cache_events&quot;: false}&#039;
```

&gt; **Note:** For dependency-free local development, disable KV event publishing (avoids NATS):
&gt; - **vLLM:** Add `--kv-events-config &#039;{&quot;enable_kv_cache_events&quot;: false}&#039;`
&gt; - **SGLang:** No flag needed (KV events disabled by default)
&gt; - **TensorRT-LLM:** No flag needed (KV events disabled by default)
&gt;
&gt; **TensorRT-LLM only:** The warning `Cannot connect to ModelExpress server/transport error. Using direct download.` is expected and can be safely ignored.
&gt;
&gt; See [Service Discovery and Messaging](#service-discovery-and-messaging) for details.

&gt; **Deprecation notice:** vLLM automatically enables KV event publishing when prefix caching is active. In a future release, this will change — KV events will be disabled by default for all backends. Start using `--kv-events-config` explicitly to prepare.

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;   -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;
    }
    ],
    &quot;stream&quot;:false,
    &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 300
  }&#039; | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

## Cloud Deployment Guides

- [Amazon EKS](examples/deployments/EKS/)
- [Google GKE](examples/deployments/GKE/)

# Building from Source

For contributors who want to build Dynamo from source rather than installing from PyPI.

## 1. Install Libraries

**Ubuntu:**

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
```

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```

If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.

## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don&#039;t have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install Build Tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust&lt;-&gt;Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust Bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install GPU Memory Service

The GPU Memory Service is a Python package with a C++ extension. It requires only Python development headers and a C++ compiler (g++).

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e lib/gpu_memory_service
```

## 7. Install the Wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e .
```

## 8. Run the Frontend

```bash
python3 -m dynamo.frontend
```

## 9. Configure for Local Development

- Pass `--discovery-backend file` to avoid external dependencies (see [Service Discovery and Messaging](#service-discovery-and-messaging))
- Set `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level (e.g., `export DYN_LOG=debug`). Uses the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`

&gt; **Note:** VSCode and Cursor users can use the `.devcontainer` folder for a pre-configured dev environment. See the [devcontainer README](.devcontainer/README.md) for details.

# Advanced Topics

## Benchmarking

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools:

- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/pages/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies using AIPerf
- **[SLA-Driven Deployments](docs/pages/components/planner/planner-guide.md)** – Optimize deployments to meet SLA requirements

## Frontend OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAI-compatible frontend exposes an OpenAPI 3 spec at `/openapi.json`. To generate without running the server:

```bash
cargo run -p dynamo-llm --bin generate-frontend-openapi
```

This writes to `docs/pages/reference/api/openapi.json`.

## Service Discovery and Messaging

Dynamo uses TCP for inter-component communication. On Kubernetes, native resources ([CRDs + EndpointSlices](docs/pages/kubernetes/service-discovery.md)) handle service discovery. External services are optional for most deployments:

| Deployment | etcd | NATS | Notes |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| **Local Development** | ❌ Not required | ❌ Not required | Pass `--discovery-backend file`; vLLM also needs `--kv-events-config &#039;{&quot;enable_kv_cache_events&quot;: false}&#039;` |
| **Kubernetes** | ❌ Not required | ❌ Not required | K8s-native discovery; TCP request plane |

&gt; **Note:** KV-Aware Routing requires NATS for prefix caching coordination.

For Slurm or other distributed deployments (and KV-aware routing):

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs JetStream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup both: `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d`

See [TRT-LLM on Slurm](examples/basics/multinode/trtllm/README.md) for deployment examples.

&lt;p&gt;TUI Application to manage Obsidian notes&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

TUI Application to manage Obsidian vaults and notes directly from the terminal ✨.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikjuhani/basalt/refs/heads/main/assets/basalt_demo.gif)

Basalt is a cross-platform TUI (Terminal User Interface) for managing Obsidian vaults and notes. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Basalt is not a replacement for Obsidian. Instead, it provides a minimalist terminal interface with a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) experience.

## Installation

Install Basalt using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```sh
cargo install basalt-tui
```

Or download a pre-compiled binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/erikjuhani/basalt/releases/latest), extract it, and move the `basalt` binary to a location in your `PATH`.

## Configuration

Basalt can be customized using a TOML configuration file. The file does not exist by default — create it manually when you want to override the defaults.

**macOS and Linux:**

- `$HOME/.basalt.toml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/basalt/config.toml`

**Windows:**

- `%USERPROFILE%\.basalt.toml`
- `%APPDATA%\basalt\config.toml`

If configuration files exist in multiple locations, only the first one found is used. The home directory configuration takes precedence.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; This behavior may change in future versions to merge all found configurations instead.

See the [full configuration reference](docs/Configuration/Configuration.md) for key mappings, custom commands, and defaults.

# Kata Containers

Welcome to Kata Containers!

This repository is the home of the Kata Containers code for the 2.0 and newer
releases.

If you want to learn about Kata Containers, visit the main
[Kata Containers website](https://katacontainers.io).

## Introduction

Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a
standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and
perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security
advantages of VMs.

## License

The code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
See [the license file](LICENSE) for further details.

## Platform support

Kata Containers currently runs on 64-bit systems supporting the following
technologies:

| Architecture | Virtualization technology |
|-|-|
| `x86_64`, `amd64` | [Intel](https://www.intel.com) VT-x, AMD SVM |
| `aarch64` (&quot;`arm64`&quot;)| [ARM](https://www.arm.com) Hyp |
| `ppc64le` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Power |
| `s390x` | [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Z &amp; LinuxONE SIE |

### Hardware requirements

The [Kata Containers runtime](src/runtime) provides a command to
determine if your host system is capable of running and creating a
Kata Container:

```bash
$ kata-runtime check
```

&gt; **Notes:**
&gt;
&gt; - This command runs a number of checks including connecting to the
&gt;   network to determine if a newer release of Kata Containers is
&gt;   available on GitHub. If you do not wish this to check to run, add
&gt;   the `--no-network-checks` option.
&gt;
&gt; - By default, only a brief success / failure message is printed.
&gt;   If more details are needed, the `--verbose` flag can be used to display the
&gt;   list of all the checks performed.
&gt;
&gt; - If the command is run as the `root` user additional checks are
&gt;   run (including checking if another incompatible hypervisor is running).
&gt;   When running as `root`, network checks are automatically disabled.

## Getting started

See the [installation documentation](docs/install).

CocoIndex makes it effortless to transform data with AI, and keep source data and target in sync. Whether you’re building a vector index, creating knowledge graphs for context engineering or performing any custom data transformations — goes beyond SQL.

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot; src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/venn2.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

## Exceptional velocity

Just declare transformation in dataflow with ~100 lines of python

```python
# import
data[&#039;content&#039;] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data[&#039;out&#039;] = data[&#039;content&#039;]
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, developers don&#039;t explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. They just need to define transformation/formula for a set of source data.

## Plug-and-Play Building Blocks

Native builtins for different source, targets and transformations. Standardize interface, make it 1-line code switch between different components - as easy as assembling building blocks.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

## Data Freshness

CocoIndex keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4eb29b3-84ee-4fa0-a1e2-80eedeeabde6&quot; alt=&quot;Incremental Processing&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It has out-of-box support for incremental indexing:

- minimal recomputation on source or logic change.
- (re-)processing necessary portions; reuse cache when possible

## Quick Start

If you&#039;re new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out

- ⚡  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- 🎬 [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```sh
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don&#039;t have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.

/plugin install cocoindex-skills@cocoindex
```

## Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name=&quot;TextEmbedding&quot;)
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path=&quot;markdown_files&quot;))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc[&quot;chunks&quot;] = doc[&quot;content&quot;].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=&quot;markdown&quot;, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc[&quot;chunks&quot;].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;] = chunk[&quot;text&quot;].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model=&quot;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&quot;))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc[&quot;filename&quot;], location=chunk[&quot;location&quot;],
                                   text=chunk[&quot;text&quot;], embedding=chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        &quot;doc_embeddings&quot;,
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=[&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;location&quot;],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name=&quot;embedding&quot;,
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:

## Roadmap

Stalwart has reached an exciting point in its journey, it’s now **feature complete**. All the core functionality and open standard email and collaboration protocols that we set out to support are in place. In other words, Stalwart already does everything you’d expect from a modern, standards-compliant mail and collaboration platform.

The next major milestone is all about refinement: finalizing the database schema and focusing on performance optimizations to ensure everything runs as efficiently and reliably as possible. Once that’s done, we’ll be ready to roll out version **1.0**.

Of course, development doesn’t stop there. The community has contributed hundreds of great ideas for improvements and new features, everything from subtle usability tweaks to entirely new integrations. You can see the full list of proposals over on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement). If there’s something you’d like to see prioritized, just give it a thumbs up as we plan to implement enhancements based on the community’s votes.

## What is Memvid?

Memvid is a portable AI memory system that packages your data, embeddings, search structure, and metadata into a single file.

Instead of running complex RAG pipelines or server-based vector databases, Memvid enables fast retrieval directly from the file.

The result is a model-agnostic, infrastructure-free memory layer that gives AI agents persistent, long-term memory they can carry anywhere.

    
## What are Smart Frames?

Memvid draws inspiration from video encoding, not to store video, but to **organize AI memory as an append-only, ultra-efficient sequence of Smart Frames.**

A Smart Frame is an immutable unit that stores content along with timestamps, checksums and basic metadata.
Frames are grouped in a way that allows efficient compression, indexing, and parallel reads.

This frame-based design enables:

-   Append-only writes without modifying or corrupting existing data
-   Queries over past memory states
-   Timeline-style inspection of how knowledge evolves
-   Crash safety through committed, immutable frames
-   Efficient compression using techniques adapted from video encoding

The result is a single file that behaves like a rewindable memory timeline for AI systems.


## Core Concepts

-   **Living Memory Engine**
    Continuously append, branch, and evolve memory across sessions.

-   **Capsule Context (`.mv2`)**
    Self-contained, shareable memory capsules with rules and expiry.

-   **Time-Travel Debugging**
    Rewind, replay, or branch any memory state.

-   **Smart Recall**
    Sub-5ms local memory access with predictive caching.

-   **Codec Intelligence**
    Auto-selects and upgrades compression over time.


## Use Cases

Memvid is a portable, serverless memory layer that gives AI agents persistent memory and fast recall. Because it&#039;s model-agnostic, multi-modal, and works fully offline, developers are using Memvid across a wide range of real-world applications.

-   Long-Running AI Agents
-   Enterprise Knowledge Bases
-   Offline-First AI Systems
-   Codebase Understanding
-   Customer Support Agents
-   Workflow Automation
-   Sales and Marketing Copilots
-   Personal Knowledge Assistants
-   Medical, Legal, and Financial Agents
-   Auditable and Debuggable AI Workflows
-   Custom Applications

## Text Embedding Models

The `vec` feature includes local text embedding support using ONNX models. Before using local text embeddings, you need to download the model files manually.

### Quick Start: BGE-small (Recommended)

Download the default BGE-small model (384 dimensions, fast and efficient):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cache/memvid/text-models

# Download ONNX model
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/bge-small-en-v1.5.onnx

# Download tokenizer
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5/resolve/main/tokenizer.json&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/bge-small-en-v1.5_tokenizer.json
```

### Available Models

| Model                   | Dimensions | Size   | Best For        |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------- |
| `bge-small-en-v1.5`     | 384        | ~120MB | Default, fast   |
| `bge-base-en-v1.5`      | 768        | ~420MB | Better quality  |
| `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` | 768        | ~530MB | Versatile tasks |
| `gte-large`             | 1024       | ~1.3GB | Highest quality |

### Other Models

**BGE-base** (768 dimensions):
```bash
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/bge-base-en-v1.5.onnx
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5/resolve/main/tokenizer.json&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/bge-base-en-v1.5_tokenizer.json
```

**Nomic** (768 dimensions):
```bash
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.onnx
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5/resolve/main/tokenizer.json&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/nomic-embed-text-v1.5_tokenizer.json
```

**GTE-large** (1024 dimensions):
```bash
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/gte-large.onnx
curl -L &#039;https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large/resolve/main/tokenizer.json&#039; \
  -o ~/.cache/memvid/text-models/gte-large_tokenizer.json
```

### Usage in Code

```rust
use memvid_core::text_embed::{LocalTextEmbedder, TextEmbedConfig};
use memvid_core::types::embedding::EmbeddingProvider;

// Use default model (BGE-small)
let config = TextEmbedConfig::default();
let embedder = LocalTextEmbedder::new(config)?;

let embedding = embedder.embed_text(&quot;hello world&quot;)?;
assert_eq!(embedding.len(), 384);

// Use different model
let config = TextEmbedConfig::bge_base();
let embedder = LocalTextEmbedder::new(config)?;
```

See `examples/text_embedding.rs` for a complete example with similarity computation and search ranking.

### Model Consistency

To prevent accidental model mixing (e.g., querying a BGE-small index with OpenAI embeddings), you can explicitly bind your Memvid instance to a specific model name:

```rust
// Bind the index to a specific model.
// If the index was previously created with a different model, this will return an error.
mem.set_vec_model(&quot;bge-small-en-v1.5&quot;)?;
```

This binding is persistent. Once set, future attempts to use a different model name will fail fast with a `ModelMismatch` error.



## API Embeddings (OpenAI)

The `api_embed` feature enables cloud-based embedding generation using OpenAI&#039;s API.

### Setup

Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;sk-...&quot;
```

### Usage

```rust
use memvid_core::api_embed::{OpenAIConfig, OpenAIEmbedder};
use memvid_core::types::embedding::EmbeddingProvider;

// Use default model (text-embedding-3-small)
let config = OpenAIConfig::default();
let embedder = OpenAIEmbedder::new(config)?;

let embedding = embedder.embed_text(&quot;hello world&quot;)?;
assert_eq!(embedding.len(), 1536);

// Use higher quality model
let config = OpenAIConfig::large();  // text-embedding-3-large (3072 dims)
let embedder = OpenAIEmbedder::new(config)?;
```

### Available Models

| Model                    | Dimensions | Best For                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536       | Default, fastest, cheapest |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3072       | Highest quality            |
| `text-embedding-ada-002` | 1536       | Legacy model               |

See `examples/openai_embedding.rs` for a complete example.

**eza** is a modern alternative for the venerable file-listing command-line program `ls` that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it’s **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.

---

**eza** features not in exa (non-exhaustive):

- Fixes [“The Grid Bug”](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/issues/66#issuecomment-1656758327) introduced in exa 2021.
- Hyperlink support.
- Mount point details.
- Selinux context output.
- Git repo status output.
- Human readable relative dates.
- Several security fixes.
- Support for `bright` terminal colours.
- Many smaller bug fixes/changes!
- Configuration `theme.yml` file for customization of colors and icons.

...and like, so much more that it became exhausting to update this all the time.
Like seriously, we have a lot of good stuff.

---

&lt;a id=&quot;try-it&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Try it!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

### Nix ❄️

If you already have Nix setup with flake support, you can try out eza with the `nix run` command:

    nix run github:eza-community/eza

Nix will build eza and run it.

If you want to pass arguments this way, use e.g. `nix run github:eza-community/eza -- -ol`.

# Installation

eza is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Platform and distribution
specific installation instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/eza.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/eza/versions)

---

&lt;a id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Command-line options&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

eza’s options are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike `ls`’s. Quick overview:

## Display options

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

- **-1**, **--oneline**: display one entry per line
- **-G**, **--grid**: display entries as a grid (default)
- **-l**, **--long**: display extended details and attributes
- **-R**, **--recurse**: recurse into directories
- **-T**, **--tree**: recurse into directories as a tree
- **-x**, **--across**: sort the grid across, rather than downwards
- **-F**, **--classify=(when)**: display type indicator by file names (always, auto, never)
- **--colo[u]r=(when)**: when to use terminal colours (always, auto, never)
- **--colo[u]r-scale=(field)**: highlight levels of `field` distinctly(all, age, size)
- **--color-scale-mode=(mode)**: use gradient or fixed colors in --color-scale. valid options are `fixed` or `gradient`
- **--icons=(when)**: when to display icons (always, auto, never)
- **--hyperlink**: display entries as hyperlinks
- **--absolute=(mode)**: display entries with their absolute path (on, follow, off)
- **-w**, **--width=(columns)**: set screen width in columns

&lt;/details&gt;

## Filtering options

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

- **-a**, **--all**: show hidden and &#039;dot&#039; files
- **-d**, **--treat-dirs-as-files**: list directories like regular files
- **-L**, **--level=(depth)**: limit the depth of recursion
- **-r**, **--reverse**: reverse the sort order
- **-s**, **--sort=(field)**: which field to sort by
- **--group-directories-first**: list directories before other files
- **--group-directories-last**: list directories after other files
- **-D**, **--only-dirs**: list only directories
- **-f**, **--only-files**: list only files
- **--no-symlinks**: don&#039;t show symbolic links
- **--show-symlinks**: explicitly show links (with `--only-dirs`, `--only-files`, to show symlinks that match the filter)
- **--git-ignore**: ignore files mentioned in `.gitignore`
- **-I**, **--ignore-glob=(globs)**: glob patterns (pipe-separated) of files to ignore

Pass the `--all` option twice to also show the `.` and `..` directories.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Long view options

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

These options are available when running with `--long` (`-l`):

- **-b**, **--binary**: list file sizes with binary prefixes
- **-B**, **--bytes**: list file sizes in bytes, without any prefixes
- **-g**, **--group**: list each file’s group
- **--smart-group**: only show group if it has a different name from owner
- **-h**, **--header**: add a header row to each column
- **-H**, **--links**: list each file’s number of hard links
- **-i**, **--inode**: list each file’s inode number
- **-m**, **--modified**: use the modified timestamp field
- **-M**, **--mounts**: Show mount details (Linux and MacOS only).
- **-S**, **--blocksize**: show size of allocated file system blocks
- **-t**, **--time=(field)**: which timestamp field to use
- **-u**, **--accessed**: use the accessed timestamp field
- **-U**, **--created**: use the created timestamp field
- **-X**, **--dereference**: dereference symlinks for file information
- **-Z**, **--context**: list each file’s security context
- **-@**, **--extended**: list each file’s extended attributes and sizes
- **--changed**: use the changed timestamp field
- **--git**: list each file’s Git status, if tracked or ignored
- **--git-repos**: list each directory’s Git status, if tracked
- **--git-repos-no-status**: list whether a directory is a Git repository, but not its status (faster)
- **--no-git**: suppress Git status (always overrides `--git`, `--git-repos`, `--git-repos-no-status`)
- **--time-style**: how to format timestamps. valid timestamp styles are ‘`default`’, ‘`iso`’, ‘`long-iso`’, ‘`full-iso`’, ‘`relative`’, or a custom style ‘`+&lt;FORMAT&gt;`’ (E.g., ‘`+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`’ =&gt; ‘`2023-09-30 13:00`’. For more specifications on the format string, see the _`eza(1)` manual page_ and [chrono documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html).).
- **--total-size**: show recursive directory size
- **--no-permissions**: suppress the permissions field
- **-o**, **--octal-permissions**: list each file&#039;s permission in octal format
- **--no-filesize**: suppress the filesize field
- **--no-user**: suppress the user field
- **--no-time**: suppress the time field
- **--stdin**: read file names from stdin

Some of the options accept parameters:

- Valid **--colo\[u\]r** options are **always**, **automatic** (or **auto** for short), and **never**.
- Valid sort fields are **accessed**, **changed**, **created**, **extension**, **Extension**, **inode**, **modified**, **name**, **Name**, **size**, **type**, and **none**. Fields starting with a capital letter sort uppercase before lowercase. The modified field has the aliases **date**, **time**, and **newest**, while its reverse has the aliases **age** and **oldest**.
- Valid time fields are **modified**, **changed**, **accessed**, and **created**.
- Valid time styles are **default**, **iso**, **long-iso**, **full-iso**, and **relative**.



See the `man` pages for further documentation of usage. They are available
- online [in the repo](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man)
- in your terminal via `man eza`, as of version [`[0.18.13] - 2024-04-25`](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01813---2024-04-25)
&lt;/details&gt;


## Custom Themes
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to expand&lt;/summary&gt;

**Eza** has recently added support for a `theme.yml` file, where you can specify all of the existing theme-ing options
available for the `LS_COLORS` and `EXA_COLORS` environment variables, as well as the option to specify different icons
for different file types and extensions. Any existing environment variables set will continue to work and will take
precedence for backwards compatibility.

#### **New** Pre-made themes
Check out the themes available in the official [eza-themes](https://github.com/eza-community/eza-themes) repository, or contribute your own.

An example theme file is available in `docs/theme.yml`, and needs to either be placed in a directory specified by the 
environment variable `EZA_CONFIG_DIR`, or will looked for by default in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/eza`.

Full details are available on the [man page](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/man/eza_colors-explanation.5.md) and an example theme file is included [here](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/tree/main/docs/theme.yml)

&lt;/details&gt;
