### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

## What is Rig?
Rig is a Rust library for building scalable, modular, and ergonomic **LLM-powered** applications.

More information about this crate can be found in the [official](https://docs.rig.rs) &amp; [crate](https://docs.rs/rig-core/latest/rig/) (API Reference) documentations.

## High-level features
- Full support for LLM completion and embedding workflows
- Simple but powerful common abstractions over LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere) and vector stores (e.g. MongoDB, SQlite, in-memory)
- Integrate LLMs in your app with minimal boilerplate

## Who is using Rig in production?
Below is a non-exhaustive list of companies and people who are using Rig in production:
- [Dria Compute Node](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dkn-compute-node) - a node that serves computation results within the Dria Knowledge Network
- [The MCP Rust SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk ) - the official Model Context Protocol Rust SDK. Has an example for usage with Rig.
- [Probe](https://github.com/buger/probe) - an AI-friendly, fully local semantic code search tool.
- [NINE](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nine) - Neural Interconnected Nodes Engine, by [Nethermind.](https://www.nethermind.io/)
- [rig-onchain-kit](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig-onchain-kit) - the Rig Onchain Kit. Intended to make interactions between Solana/EVM and Rig much easier to implement.
- [Linera Protocol](https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol) - Decentralized blockchain infrastructure designed for highly scalable, secure, low-latency Web3 applications.
- [Listen](https://github.com/piotrostr/listen) - A framework aiming to become the go-to framework for AI portfolio management agents. Powers [the Listen app.](https://app.listen-rs.com/)

Are you also using Rig in production? [Open an issue](https://www.github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig/issues) to have your name added!

## Get Started
```bash
cargo add rig-core
```

### Simple example:
```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and model
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent(&quot;gpt-4&quot;).build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;)
        .await
        .expect(&quot;Failed to prompt GPT-4&quot;);

    println!(&quot;GPT-4: {response}&quot;);
}
```
Note using `#[tokio::main]` requires you enable tokio&#039;s `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` features
or just `full` to enable all features (`cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread`).

You can find more examples each crate&#039;s `examples` (ie. [`rig-core/examples`](./rig-core/examples)) directory. More detailed use cases walkthroughs are regularly published on our [Dev.to Blog](https://dev.to/0thtachi) and added to Rig&#039;s official documentation [(docs.rig.rs)](http://docs.rig.rs).

## API

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [üí° Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!
    ids=[&quot;doc1&quot;, &quot;doc2&quot;], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=[&quot;This is a query document&quot;],
    n_results=2,
    # where={&quot;metadata_field&quot;: &quot;is_equal_to_this&quot;}, # optional filter
    # where_document={&quot;$contains&quot;:&quot;search_string&quot;}  # optional filter
)
```

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT4` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. üñºÔ∏è or üìÑ =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use‚Äîwhether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]‚Äîwith a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes‚Äîwhich is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any
questions, or want to talk about future plans, please join us on Discord

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and
use the bridge to follow IRC.

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

SWC (stands for `Speedy Web Compiler`) is a super-fast TypeScript / JavaScript compiler written in Rust. It&#039;s a library for Rust and JavaScript at the same time. If you are using SWC from Rust, see [rustdoc](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc/) and for most users, your entry point for using the library will be [parser](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_parser/).

Also, SWC tries to ensure that

&gt; If you select the latest version of each crates, it will work

for rust users.

MSRV of crates is currently `1.73`.

To update all SWC crates you use, you can run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swc-project/swc/main/scripts/update-all-swc-crates.sh | bash -s`. This script will update all dependencies to the latest version and run `cargo build` to ensure that everything works.
Note that you need

-   `jq`
-   `cargo upgrade`

command to run the script.

Supported Node Versions:

-   Node v10+ for usage
-   Node v20+ for development

---

If you are using SWC from JavaScript, please refer to [docs on the website](https://swc.rs/docs/installation/).

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

### Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- [**Forge**](#forge): Build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy [Solidity][solidity] contracts, like Hardhat, Brownie, Ape.
- [**Cast**](#cast): A Swiss Army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [**Anvil**](#anvil): Fast local Ethereum development node, akin to Hardhat Network, Tenderly.
- [**Chisel**](#chisel): Fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

**Need help getting started with Foundry? Read the [üìñ Foundry Docs][foundry-docs]!**

![Demo](.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **High-Performance Compilation**

  - **Fast and Flexible**: Automatically detects and installs the required Solidity compiler version.
  - **Solidity and Vyper Support**: Fully supports both Solidity and Vyper out-of-the-box.
  - **Incremental Compilation**: Re-compiles only changed files, saving time.
  - **Parallelized Pipeline**: Leverages multi-core systems for ultra-fast builds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Supports non-standard directory structures, including [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829).

- **Advanced Testing**

  - **No Context Switching**: Write tests directly in Solidity.
  - **Fuzz Testing**: Quickly identify edge cases with input shrinking and counter-example generation.
  - **Invariant Testing**: Ensure complex system properties hold across a wide range of inputs.
  - **Debugging Made Easy**: Use [forge-std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std)&#039;s `console.sol` for flexible debug logging.
  - **Interactive Debugger**: Step through your Solidity code with Foundry&#039;s interactive debugger, making it easy to pinpoint issues.

- **Powerful Runtime Features**

  - **RPC Forking**: Fast and efficient remote RPC forking backed by [Alloy][alloy].
  - **Lightweight &amp; Portable**: No dependency on Nix or other package managers for installation.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**

  - **Optimized CI**: Accelerate builds, run tests and execute scripts using [Foundry&#039;s GitHub action][foundry-gha].

## Installation

Getting started is very easy:

Install `foundryup`:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Next, run `foundryup`.

It will automatically install the latest version of the precompiled binaries: [`forge`](#forge), [`cast`](#cast), [`anvil`](#anvil), and [`chisel`](#chisel).

```
foundryup
```

**Done!**

For additional details see the [installation guide](https://getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs].

If you&#039;re experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://getfoundry.sh/faq).

## How Fast?

Forge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging `solc` with [foundry-compilers]) and testing.

See the benchmarks below. Older benchmarks against [DappTools][dapptools] can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.

### Testing Benchmarks

| Project                                       | Type                 | [Forge 1.0][foundry-1.0] | [Forge 0.2][foundry-0.2] | DappTools | Speedup        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| [vectorized/solady][solady]                   | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.9s                     | 2.3s                     | -         | 2.6x           |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue][morpho-blue]         | Invariant            | 0.7s                     | 1m43s                    | -         | 147.1x         |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cold)   | 6.1s                     | 6.3s                     | -         | 1.04x          |
| [morpho-org/morpho-blue-oracles][morpho-blue] | Integration (Cached) | 0.6s                     | 0.9s                     | -         | 1.50x          |
| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate]            | Unit / Fuzz          | 2.7s                     | 2.8s                     | 6m34s     | 1.03x / 140.0x |
| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]                      | Unit / Fuzz          | 0.2s                     | 0.4s                     | 23s       | 2.0x / 57.5x   |

_In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_

**Takeaway: Forge dramatically outperforms the competition, delivering blazing-fast execution speeds while continuously expanding its robust feature set.**

### Compilation Benchmarks

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_dark.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_solady_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/assets/build_benchmark_openzeppelin_light.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/picture&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;

**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster than Hardhat by a factor of `2.1x` to `5.2x`, depending on the amount of caching involved.**

## Forge

Forge helps you build, test, fuzz, debug and deploy Solidity contracts.

The best way to understand Forge is to simply try it (in less than 30 seconds!).

First, let&#039;s initialize a new `counter` example repository:

```sh
forge init counter
```

Next `cd` into `counter` and build :

```sh
forge build
```

```console
[‚†ä] Compiling...
[‚†î] Compiling 27 files with Solc 0.8.28
[‚†í] Solc 0.8.28 finished in 452.13ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Let&#039;s [test](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/tests#tests) our contracts:

```sh
forge test
```

```console
[‚†ä] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Ran 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, Œº: 31121, ~: 31277)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 31293)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 5.35ms (4.86ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 5.91ms (5.35ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

Finally, let&#039;s run our deployment script:

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol
```

```console
[‚†ä] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
Gas used: 109037

If you wish to simulate on-chain transactions pass a RPC URL.
```

Run `forge --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Cast

Cast is a Swiss Army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

**Check the latest block on Ethereum Mainnet**:

```sh
cast block-number --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Check the Ether balance of `vitalik.eth`**

```sh
cast balance vitalik.eth --ether --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

**Replay and trace a transaction**

```sh
cast run 0x9c32042f5e997e27e67f82583839548eb19dc78c4769ad6218657c17f2a5ed31 --rpc-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

Optionally, pass `--etherscan-api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt;` to decode transaction traces using verified source maps, providing more detailed and human-readable information.

---

Run `cast --help` to explore the full list of available subcommands and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Anvil

Anvil is a fast local Ethereum development node.

Let&#039;s fork Ethereum mainnet at the latest block:

```sh
anvil --fork-url https://eth.merkle.io
```

You can use those same `cast` subcommands against your `anvil` instance:

```sh
cast block-number
```

---

Run `anvil --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Chisel

Chisel is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose Solidity REPL.

To use Chisel, simply type `chisel`.

```sh
chisel
```

From here, start writing Solidity code! Chisel will offer verbose feedback on each input.

Create a variable `a` and query it:

```console
‚ûú uint256 a = 123;
‚ûú a
Type: uint256
‚îú Hex: 0x7b
‚îú Hex (full word): 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b
‚îî Decimal: 123
```

Finally, run `!source` to see `a` was applied:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {Vm} from &quot;forge-std/Vm.sol&quot;;

contract REPL {
    Vm internal constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(&quot;hevm cheat code&quot;)))));

    /// @notice REPL contract entry point
    function run() public {
        uint256 a = 123;
    }
}
```

---

Run `chisel --help` to explore the full list of available features and their usage.

More documentation can be found in the [chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview) section of the Foundry Docs.

## Configuration

Foundry is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor it to your needs. Configuration is managed via a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) located in the root of your project or any parent directory. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the [config package documentation](./crates/config/README.md#all-options).

**Profiles and Namespaces**

- Configuration can be organized into **profiles**, which are arbitrarily namespaced for flexibility.
- The default profile is named `default`. Learn more in the [Default Profile section](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile).
- To select a different profile, set the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Override specific settings using environment variables prefixed with `FOUNDRY_` (e.g., `FOUNDRY_SRC`).

---

You can find additional [setup and configurations guides](https://getfoundry.sh/config/overview) in the [Foundry Docs][foundry-docs] and in the [config crate](./crates/config/README.md):

## About

### What is FHEVM?

**FHEVM** is the core framework of the *Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol*. It enables confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing encrypted data to be processed directly onchain.

FHEVM ensures both confidentiality and composability, with the following guarantees:
- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn&#039;t impact existing dApps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Project structure
The directories of this repository are organized in the following way:

###### FHEVM Contracts

- **`gateway-contracts/`**: Smart contracts managing the gateway between on-chain and off-chain components.

- **`host-contracts/`**: Smart Contracts deployed on the host chain for orchestrating FHE workflows.

###### FHEVM Compute Engines

- **`coprocessor/`**: Rust-based coprocessor implementation for FHE operations.

- **`kms-connector/`**: Interface for integrating with Key Management Services (KMS) to handle encryption keys securely.

###### FHEVM Utilities
- **`charts/`**: Helm charts and deployment configurations for the stack.

- **`golden-container-images/`**: Docker golden images for Node.js and Rust environments used as base images by the stack.

- **`test-suite/`**: Integration with docker-compose and tests covering end-to-end FHEVM stack behavior.



  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
### Main features

- **Privacy by design:** Building decentralized apps with full privacy and confidentiality on Ethereum, leveraging FHE.
- **Solidity integration:** Write FHEVM contracts like any standard Solidity contract using Solidity. Compatible with existing toolchains ‚Äî such as Hardhat and Foundry (*coming soon*).
- **Programmable privacy:**  Define exactly what data is encrypted and write the access control logic directly in your smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers.
- **Full range of operators:** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, ternary-if, boolean operations‚Ä¶. Consecutive FHE operations are not limited.
- **Security:** The underlying FHE crypto-scheme of FHEVM is quantum-resistant. Decryption is managed via a key management system (KMS) using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring security even if some parties are compromised or misbehaving.
- **Symbolic execution of FHE computations:** All FHE operations are executed symbolically on the host chain, significantly reducing execution time. The actual computations on encrypted data are offloaded asynchronously to our coprocessor, allowing for faster, efficient, and scalable processing.

_Learn more about FHEVM features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) and in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/blob/main/fhevm-whitepaper.pdf)._
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

### Use cases

FHEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging FHEVM, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.

_Learn more use cases in the [list of examples](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/examples)._

OpenObserve (O2 for short) is a cloud-native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, RUM (Real User Monitoring - Performance, Errors, Session Replay) designed to work at petabyte scale.

It is straightforward and easy to operate, in contrast to Elasticsearch, which requires understanding and tuning numerous settings. Get OpenObserve up and running in under 2 minutes.

OpenObserve serves as a seamless replacement for Elasticsearch for users who ingest data using APIs and perform searches. OpenObserve comes with its own user interface, eliminating the need for separate installation.

You can reduce your log storage costs by ~140x compared to Elasticsearch by using OpenObserve. Below, we present the results from pushing logs from our production Kubernetes cluster to both Elasticsearch and OpenObserve using Fluent Bit.

[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.12.10
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

## Wiki

Tabiew started as a humble hobby TUI project for viewing CSV data but has evolved to incorporate various features and improvements from valuable community feedbacks. As the project expanded, so did the need for comprehensive documentation, leading to the creation of the [wiki page](https://github.com/shshemi/tabiew/wiki). The wiki offers explanations of features and the best practices to get the most out of Tabiew.

## Installation

There are various ways to install Tabiew:

### Arch Linux

 ```

### Build from Source

Ensure you have rustc version 1.80 (or higher) installed. Download the desired source version from the [release page](https://github.com/shshemi/tabiew/releases). Extract the downloaded file and navigate into the extracted directory. Then run the following command:
```bash
cargo build --release
cp ./target/release/tw &lt;system_or_local_bin_path&gt;
```

## Usage

Start Tabiew with `tw`
```bash
tw &lt;path_to_csv(s)&gt;
```

To open TSV file(s), use:
```bash
tw &lt;path_to_tsv(s)&gt; --separator $&#039;\t&#039; --no-header
```

To open parquet file(s), use:
```bash
tw &lt;path_to_parquet(s)&gt; -f parquet
```

To open a URL, use curl to pipe the output directly to Tabiew:
```bash
curl -s &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/shshemi/tabiew/housing.csv&quot; | tw

## ‚öì Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript written in Rust.

Our goal is to enable a new generation of faster, more reliable development tools by providing:

- **Performance**: 2-100x faster than existing JavaScript tools
- **Reliability**: 100% compatibility with JavaScript and TypeScript standards
- **Modularity**: Use individual tools or compose them into complete toolchains
- **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and seamless editor integration

We are building a parser, linter, formatter, transformer, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

For more information, check out our documentation at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs) and architecture guide in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## VoidZero Inc.

Oxc is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/blog).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## üôãWho&#039;s using Oxc?

- [Rolldown] uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing and transformation.
- [Nova engine](https://trynova.dev) uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing.
- [Rolldown][rolldown], [swc-node](https://github.com/swc-project/swc-node) and [knip](https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip) use the [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] crate for module resolution.
- Projects and companies like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/4c20c23c16dd60f380ce9fe98afc93041a7e1562/oxlint.json), [Shopify](https://oxc.rs/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html#_50-100-times-faster-than-eslint), ByteDance and Shopee uses oxlint for linting.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ‚å®Ô∏è Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

We have optimized Rust compilation speed to ensure developing your own Oxc-based tools remains efficient.
Our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain) complete in approximately 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

## üéØ Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### üî∏ AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling, any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.

#### üèÜ Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

### üî∏ Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### üèÜ Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

### üî∏ Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### üî∏ Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript, React, ES6 transforms are complete.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### üî∏ Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indicates that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### üî∏ Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

See [minification benchmarks](https://github.com/privatenumber/minification-benchmarks) for comparisons.

### üî∏ Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

## üß™Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages

If you would like to keep all the game data in the same folder as the executable, you just need to create a file called &quot;portable.txt&quot; in the same directory as the executable.

## flatpak

If you want to run the flatpak from the command line, you need to add the `--filesystem=host:ro` option, for example:

```
flatpak run --filesystem=host:ro io.github.gopher64.gopher64 /path/to/rom.z64
```

## building and usage

1. Linux only: install the SDL3 dependencies: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-linux#build-dependencies
2. Install rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
3. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64.git`
4. `cd gopher64`
5. `cargo build --release`
6. `./target/release/gopher64 /path/to/rom.z64`

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Rust HTTP server for Python&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

Granian is a Rust HTTP server for Python applications built on top of [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) and [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).

## Rationale

The main reasons behind Granian design are:

- Have a single, correct HTTP implementation, supporting versions 1, 2 (and eventually 3)
- Provide a single package for several platforms
- Avoid the usual Gunicorn + uvicorn + http-tools dependency composition on unix systems
- Provide stable [performance](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/blob/master/benchmarks/vs.md) when compared to existing alternatives

Adopting Granian would thus be a good choice when:

- wanting a modern, single dependency to serve both ASGI and WSGI applications
- looking for the most performant way to serve your Python application under HTTP/2
- you need great concurrency capabilities, especially with websockets
- you care about performance more than everything else

On the other hand, Granian won&#039;t be the ideal option if:

- you want a *pure Python* solution
- you need advanced debugging features
- your application relies on `trio` or `gevent`
- you&#039;re looking for ASGI extensions [not (yet) implemented](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/issues/93) like trailers

## Features

- Supports ASGI/3, [RSGI](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/blob/master/docs/spec/RSGI.md) and WSGI interface applications
- HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocols
- HTTPS and mTLS
- Websockets
- Direct static files serving
- ASGI [pathsend](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html#path-send) extension

## Quickstart

You can install Granian using pip:

    $ pip install granian

### ASGI

Create an application in your `main.py`:

```python
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope[&#039;type&#039;] == &#039;http&#039;

    await send({
        &#039;type&#039;: &#039;http.response.start&#039;,
        &#039;status&#039;: 200,
        &#039;headers&#039;: [
            [b&#039;content-type&#039;, b&#039;text/plain&#039;],
        ],
    })
    await send({
        &#039;type&#039;: &#039;http.response.body&#039;,
        &#039;body&#039;: b&#039;Hello, world!&#039;,
    })
```

and serve it using Granian CLI:

    $ granian --interface asgi main:app

### RSGI

Create an application your `main.py`:

```python
async def app(scope, proto):
    assert scope.proto == &#039;http&#039;

    proto.response_str(
        status=200,
        headers=[
            (&#039;content-type&#039;, &#039;text/plain&#039;)
        ],
        body=&quot;Hello, world!&quot;
    )
```

and serve it using Granian CLI:

    $ granian --interface rsgi main:app

### WSGI

Create an application your `main.py`:

```python
def app(environ, start_response):
    start_response(&#039;200 OK&#039;, [(&#039;content-type&#039;, &#039;text/plain&#039;)])
    return [b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;]
```

and serve it using Granian CLI:

    $ granian --interface wsgi main:app

## Extra dependencies

Mind that Granian also provides several extra dependencies you might be interested into, in particular:

- dotenv (allows to load environment files)
- pname (allows to customize processes&#039; names)
- reload (adds reload on changes functionality)
- [rloop](https://pypi.org/project/rloop/)
- [uvloop](https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/)

You can combine the above extras to suit your needs, eg:

    $ pip install granian[pname,uvloop]

For further information, check the options below.

### Human-readable durations

Whenever Granian accepts a duration, it can be specified either as sole number, in which case it is interpreted as a number of seconds, or using one of the following suffixes:

| suffix | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `s` | seconds (same as no suffix) |
| `m` | minutes |
| `h` | hours |
| `d` | days |

### Logging

Despite being a Rust project, Granian is a good Python citizen and uses the standard library&#039;s [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module to produce logs. This means you can freely configure your logging level and format using the [standard idioms](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) you probably familiar with.

As many other web servers, Granian uses two different loggers, specifically:

- the `_granian` logger for runtime messages
- the `granian.access` logger for access logs

### Access log format

The access log format can be configured by specifying the atoms (see below) to include in a specific format. By default Granian will use `[%(time)s] %(addr)s - &quot;%(method)s %(path)s %(protocol)s&quot; %(status)d %(dt_ms).3f` as the format.

#### Access log atoms

The following atoms are available for use:

| identifier | description |
| --- | --- |
| addr | Client remote address |
| time | Datetime of the request | 
| dt_ms | Request duration in ms |
| status | HTTP response status |
| path | Request path (without query string) |
| query\_string | Request query string |
| method | Request HTTP method |
| scheme | Request scheme |
| protocol | HTTP protocol version |

### Workers and threads

Granian offers different options to configure the number of workers and threads to be run, in particular:

- **workers**: the total number of processes holding a dedicated Python interpreter that will run the application
- **blocking threads**: the number of threads per worker interacting with the Python interpreter
- **runtime threads**: the number of Rust threads per worker that will perform network I/O
- **runtime blocking threads**: the number of Rust threads per worker involved in blocking operations. The main role of these threads is dealing with blocking I/O ‚Äì¬†like file system operations.

In general, Granian will try its best to automatically pick proper values for the threading configuration, le

This repository has the source code for Comprehensive Rust ü¶Ä, a multi-day Rust
course developed by the Android team. The course covers all aspects of Rust,
from basic syntax to generics and error handling. It also includes deep dives on
[Android], [Chromium], [bare-metal], and [concurrency].

[Android]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/android.html
[Chromium]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/chromium.html
[bare-metal]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html
[concurrency]: https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/concurrency.html

## Course Format and Target Audience

The course is used internally at Google when teaching Rust to experienced
software engineers. They typically have a background in C++ or Java.

The course is taught in a classroom setting and we hope it will be useful for
others who want to teach Rust to their team. The course will be less useful for
self-study since you miss out on the discussions happening in the classroom. You
don&#039;t see the questions and answers and you don&#039;t see the compiler errors we
trigger when going through the code samples. We hope to improve on this via
[speaker notes](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/53) and by
[publishing videos](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/issues/52).

| `cargo xtask build`         | Create a static version of the course in the `book/` directory. Note that you have to separately build and zip exercises and add them to book/html. To build any of the translated versions of the course, add the language flag (--language or -l) followed by xx, where xx is the ISO 639 language code (e.g. cargo xtask build -l da for the Danish translation). [TRANSLATIONS.md](TRANSLATIONS.md) contains further instructions. |

&gt; **Note** On Windows, you need to enable symlinks
&gt; (`git config --global core.symlinks true`) and Developer Mode.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ZKsync Era: A ZK Rollup For Scaling Ethereum

[![Logo](eraLogo.png)](https://zksync.io/)

ZKsync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or
decentralization. Since it&#039;s EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring
or re-auditing a single line of code. ZKsync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers
write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.

## Disclaimer

ZKsync Era has been through lots of testing and audits. Although it is live, it is still in alpha state and will go
through more audits and bug bounty programs. We would love to hear our community&#039;s thoughts and suggestions about it! It
is important to state that forking it now can potentially lead to missing important security updates, critical features,
and performance improvements.
