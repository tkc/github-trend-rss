    style=&quot;max-width: 100%; height: auto;&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

### Key Features

-   Multiple chart/panel types:
    -   **Heatmap (Historical DOM):** Uses live trades and L2 orderbook to create a time-series heatmap chart. Supports customizable price grouping, different time aggregations, fixed or visible range volume profiles.
    -   **Candlestick:** Traditional kline chart supporting both time-based and custom tick-based intervals.
    -   **Footprint:** Price grouped and interval aggregated views for trades on top of a candlestick chart. Supports different clustering methods, configurable imbalance and naked-POC studies.
    -   **Time &amp; Sales:** Scrollable list of live trades.
    -   **DOM (Depth of Market) / Ladder:** Displays current L2 orderbook alongside recent trade volumes on grouped price levels.
    -   **Comparison:** Line graph for comparing multiple data sources, normalized by kline `close` prices on a percentage scale
-   Real-time sound effects driven by trade streams
-   Multi window/monitor support
-   Pane linking for quickly switching tickers across multiple panes
-   Persistent layouts and customizable themes with editable color palettes

##### Market data is received directly from exchanges&#039; public REST APIs and WebSockets

#

#### Historical Trades on Footprint Charts:

-   By default, it captures and plots live trades in real time via WebSocket.
-   For Binance tickers, you can optionally backfill the visible time range by enabling trade fetching in the settings:
    -   [data.binance.vision](https://data.binance.vision/): Fast daily bulk downloads (no intraday).
    -   REST API (e.g., `/fapi/v1/aggTrades`): Slower, paginated intraday fetching (subject to rate limits).
    -   The Binance connector can use either or both methods to retrieve historical data as needed.
-   Fetching trades for Bybit/Hyperliquid is not supported, as both lack a suitable REST API. OKX is WIP.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Fresh

A terminal-based text editor. [Official Website →](https://sinelaw.github.io/fresh/)

**[📦 Installation Instructions](#installation)**

**[Contributing](#contributing)**

## Why?

Why another text editor? Fresh brings the intuitive, conventional UX of editors like VS Code and Sublime Text to the terminal.

While veterans like Emacs and Vim - and newer editors like Neovim and Helix - are excellent for power users who prefer modal, highly specialized workflows, they often present a steep learning curve for those used to standard GUI interactions. Fresh is built for the developer who wants a familiar, non-modal experience out-of-the-box, without sacrificing the speed and portability of the command line. Keyboard bindings, mouse support, menus, command palette etc. are all designed to be familiar to most modern users.

Architecturally, Fresh is built to handle multi-gigabyte files or slow network streams efficiently, maintaining a negligible memory overhead regardless of file size. While traditional editors struggle with latency and RAM bloat on large files, Fresh delivers consistent, high-speed performance on any scale.

The goal for Fresh is to be an intuitive and accessible, high-performance terminal-based editor that &quot;just works&quot; on any hardware, for everyone.

## Discovery &amp; Ease of Use

Fresh is designed for discovery. It features native UIs, a full Menu system, and a powerful Command Palette. With full mouse support, transitioning from graphical editors is seamless.

## Modern Extensibility

Extend Fresh easily using modern tools. Plugins are written in TypeScript and run securely in a sandboxed Deno environment, providing access to a modern JavaScript ecosystem without compromising stability.

## Low-Latency Performance

Fresh is engineered for speed. It delivers a low-latency experience, with text appearing instantly. The editor is designed to be light and fast, reliably opening and editing [huge files up to multi-gigabyte sizes](https://noamlewis.com/blog/2025/12/09/how-fresh-loads-huge-files-fast) without slowdown.

## Comprehensive Feature Set

- **File Management**: open/save/new/close, file explorer, tabs, auto-revert, git file finder
- **Editing**: undo/redo, multi-cursor, block selection, smart indent, comments, clipboard
- **Search &amp; Replace**: incremental search, find in selection, query replace, git grep
- **Navigation**: go to line/bracket, word movement, position history, bookmarks, error navigation
- **Views &amp; Layout**: split panes, line numbers, line wrap, backgrounds, markdown preview
- **Language Server (LSP)**: go to definition, references, hover, code actions, rename, diagnostics, autocompletion
- **Productivity**: command palette, menu bar, keyboard macros, git log, diagnostics panel
- **Plugins &amp; Extensibility**: TypeScript plugins, color highlighter, TODO highlighter, merge conflicts, path complete, keymaps

## Installation

Quick install (autodetect best method):

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinelaw/fresh/refs/heads/master/scripts/install.sh | sh`

Or, pick your preferred method:

| Platform | Method |
|----------|--------|
| macOS | [brew](#brew) |
| Bazzite/Bluefin/Aurora Linux | [brew](#brew) |
| Arch Linux | [AUR](#arch-linux-aur) |
| Debian/Ubuntu | [.deb](#debianubuntu-deb) |

| Rust users | [crates.io](#from-cratesio) |
| Nix | [Nix flakes](#nix-flakes) |
| Developers | [From source](#from-source) |

### Brew

On macOS and some linux distros (Bazzite/Bluefin/Aurora):

```bash
brew tap sinelaw/fresh
brew install fresh-editor
```

### Arch Linux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fresh-editor-bin))

**Binary package (recommended, faster install):**

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/fresh-editor-bin.git
cd fresh-editor-bin
makepkg --syncdeps --install
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/fresh-editor.git
cd fresh-editor
makepkg --syncdeps --install
```

**Using an AUR helper (such as `yay` or `paru`):**

```bash
# Binary package (recommended, faster install)
yay -S fresh-editor-bin

# Or build from source
yay -S fresh-editor
```

### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)

Download and install the latest release:

```bash
curl -sL $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/sinelaw/fresh/releases/latest | grep &quot;browser_download_url.*_$(dpkg --print-architecture)\.deb&quot; | cut -d &#039;&quot;&#039; -f 4) -o fresh-editor.deb &amp;&amp; sudo dpkg -i fresh-editor.deb
```

Or download the `.deb` file manually from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases).

### Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE (.rpm)

Download and install the latest release:

```bash
curl -sL $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/sinelaw/fresh/releases/latest | grep &quot;browser_download_url.*\.$(uname -m)\.rpm&quot; | cut -d &#039;&quot;&#039; -f 4) -o fresh-editor.rpm &amp;&amp; sudo rpm -U fresh-editor.rpm
```

Or download the `.rpm` file manually from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases).

### AppImage

Download the `.AppImage` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases) and run:

```bash
chmod +x fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage
./fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage
```

**For faster startup** (recommended): Extract the AppImage instead of running it directly. This avoids the FUSE mount overhead on each launch (~10x faster):

```bash
./fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fresh-editor ~/.local/bin
mv squashfs-root/* ~/.local/share/fresh-editor/
ln -sf ~/.local/share/fresh-editor/usr/bin/fresh ~/.local/bin/fresh
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Available for x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.

### Flatpak

Download the `.flatpak` bundle from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases) and install:

```bash
flatpak install --user fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.sinelaw.fresh
```

See [flatpak/README.md](flatpak/README.md) for building from source.

### Pre-built binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases).

### npm

```bash
npm install -g @fresh-editor/fresh-editor
```

Or try it without installing:

```bash
npx @fresh-editor/fresh-editor
```

### Using cargo-binstall

To install the binary directly without compiling (much faster than crates.io):

First, install cargo-binstall if you haven&#039;t already

```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
```

Then install fresh

```bash
cargo binstall fresh-editor
```

### Nix flakes

Run without installing:
```bash
nix run github:sinelaw/fresh
```

Or install to your profile:
```bash
nix profile install github:sinelaw/fresh
```

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install fresh-editor
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh.git
cd fresh
cargo build --release
./target/release/fresh [file]
```

- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

1. **Reproduce Before Fixing**: Always include a test case that reproduces the bug (fails) without the fix, and passes with the fix. This ensures the issue is verified and prevents future regressions.

2. **E2E Tests for New Flows**: Any new user flow or feature must include an end-to-end (e2e) test. E2E tests send keyboard/mouse events and examines the final rendered output, do not examine internal state.

3. **No timeouts or time-sensitive tests**: Use &quot;semantic waiting&quot; (waiting for specific state changes/events) instead of fixed timers to ensure test stability. Wait indefinitely, don&#039;t put timeouts inside tests (cargo nextest will timeout externally).

4. **Test isolation**: Tests should run in parallel. Use the internal clipboard mode in tests to isolate them from the host system and prevent flakiness in CI. Same for other external resources (temp files, etc. should all be isolated between tests, under a per-test temporary workdir).

5. **Required Formatting**: All code must be formatted with `cargo fmt` before submission. PRs that fail formatting checks will not be merged.

6. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Avoid hard-coding newline or CRLF related logic, consider the buffer mode.

7. **LSP**: Ensure LSP interactions follow the correct lifecycle (e.g., `didOpen` must always precede other requests to avoid server-side errors). Use the appropriate existing helpers for this pattern.

**Tip**: You can use tmux + send-keys + render-pane to script ad-hoc tests on the UI, for example when trying to reproduce an issue.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

| Platform   | Versions                                                                                                        |

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

## Dependencies

Desktop versions use Flutter or Sciter (deprecated) for GUI, this tutorial is for Sciter only, since it is easier and more friendly to start. Check out our [CI](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml) for building Flutter version.

Please download Sciter dynamic library yourself.

[Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.win/x64/sciter.dll) |
[Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so) |
[macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.osx/libsciter.dylib)

## Raw Steps to build

- Prepare your Rust development env and C++ build env

- Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and set `VCPKG_ROOT` env variable correctly

  - Windows: vcpkg install libvpx:x64-windows-static libyuv:x64-windows-static opus:x64-windows-static aom:x64-windows-static
  - Linux/macOS: vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom

- run `cargo run`

## [Build](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/dev/build/)

## How to Build on Linux

### Ubuntu 18 (Debian 10)

```sh
sudo apt install -y zip g++ gcc git curl wget nasm yasm libgtk-3-dev clang libxcb-randr0-dev libxdo-dev \
        libxfixes-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev cmake make \
        libclang-dev ninja-build libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libpam0g-dev
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libXfixes-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel xdotool-devel pam-devel
```

### Fedora 28 (CentOS 8)

```sh
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ git curl wget nasm yasm gcc gtk3-devel clang libxcb-devel libxdo-devel libXfixes-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel cmake alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel pam-devel
```

### Arch (Manjaro)

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed unzip git cmake gcc curl wget yasm nasm zip make pkg-config clang gtk3 xdotool libxcb libxfixes alsa-lib pipewire
```

### Install vcpkg

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2023.04.15
cd ..
vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
vcpkg/vcpkg install libvpx libyuv opus aom
```

### Fix libvpx (For Fedora)

```sh
cd vcpkg/buildtrees/libvpx/src
cd *
./configure
sed -i &#039;s/CFLAGS+=-I/CFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
sed -i &#039;s/CXXFLAGS+=-I/CXXFLAGS+=-fPIC -I/g&#039; Makefile
make
cp libvpx.a $HOME/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib/
cd
```

### Build

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
mkdir -p target/debug
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/master/bin.lnx/x64/libsciter-gtk.so
mv libsciter-gtk.so target/debug
VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg cargo run
```

## How to build with Docker

Begin by cloning the repository and building the Docker container:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
cd rustdesk
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t &quot;rustdesk-builder&quot; .
```

Then, each time you need to build the application, run the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/user/rustdesk -v rustdesk-git-cache:/home/user/.cargo/git -v rustdesk-registry-cache:/home/user/.cargo/registry -e PUID=&quot;$(id -u)&quot; -e PGID=&quot;$(id -g)&quot; rustdesk-builder
```

Note that the first build may take longer before dependencies are cached, subsequent builds will be faster. Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the `&lt;OPTIONAL-ARGS&gt;` position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by `--release`. The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with:

```sh
target/debug/rustdesk
```

Or, if you&#039;re running a release executable:

```sh
target/release/rustdesk
```

Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as `install` or `run` are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.

# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.art) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies on the planned [roadmap](https://graphite.art/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

Difftastic is a structural diff tool that compares files based on
their syntax.

**For installation instructions, see
[Installation](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/installation.html) in
[the manual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/).**

## Examples

![Screenshot of difftastic and Rust](img/wrap_expr.png)

^ Difftastic understands exactly which pieces of syntax have changed,
and can highlight them in context.

![Screenshot of difftastic and HTML](img/html.png)

^ Difftastic understands when whitespace matters, and when it&#039;s just
an indentation change.

![Screenshot of difftastic and JS](img/reformat.png)

^ Difftastic is not line-oriented. If you reformat your code and it&#039;s
now split over multiple lines, difftastic will show you what&#039;s
actually changed.

![Screenshot of difftastic and git](img/git.png)

^ Difftastic is compatible with git (see [the configuration
instructions](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html)), as well as
many other version control systems.

## Languages Supported

Difftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.

If a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a
line-oriented diff with word highlighting.

## Known Issues

Performance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large
number of changes, and can use a lot of memory.

Display. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can
be confusing.

Robustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.

## Non-goals

Patching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it
does not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you
need a patch.

(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for
difftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same
line, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old
and new file.)

Merging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not
address. You might be interested in the [mergiraf
tool](https://mergiraf.org/) (&quot;merge giraffe&quot;), which does do AST
merging.

## FAQ

### Can I use difftastic with git?

You can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git
usage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it
[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).

If you&#039;re an Emacs user, check out [this blog
post](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)
showing one way to use difftastic with magit, as well as
[difftastic.el](https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el).

### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?

Probably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your
favourite tool, and I will link it in the README!

### What about parse errors?

By default, difftastic falls back to a line-oriented diff whenever
parse errors are encountered.

This is a conservative choice to ensure that difftastic never claims
that two syntactically different files are the same.

Parse errors can occur if the file uses language features that the
parser does not understand, if the language relies on a preprocessor
before parsing (e.g. C++), or if the file has genuine syntactic
mistakes.

In practice, difftastic virtually always produces a good result when
there are a few minor parse errors. Consider allowing a small number
of parse errors when using difftastic.

```
$ export DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT=20
$ difft foo1.c foo2.c
```

### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?

Yes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers
(i.e. `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`).

Pass your file with conflicts as a single argument to
difftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and
diff those.

```
$ difft file_with_conflicts.js
```

### Can difftastic do merges?

No. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.

AST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text
diff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn&#039;t syntactically
significant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.

The [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on
a tree-sitter AST however.

### Can difftastic ignore reordering?

No. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing
e.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.

If you&#039;re diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them
to difftastic.

```
$ difft &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_1.json) &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_2.json)
```

See also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data
Types](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)
in the manual.

### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?

Yes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without
calculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and
useful for building tools that check for changes.

For example:

```
$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js
```

This will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or
1 if there are changes found.

### Why aren&#039;t colours appearing in my terminal?

Difftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal
themes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that
does this.

If you&#039;re a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to
disable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.

### How does it work?

Difftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses
Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm.

My [blog
post](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)
describes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).

Spacedrive is an open source cross-platform file manager, powered by a virtual distributed filesystem (VDFS) written in Rust.

Organize files across multiple devices, clouds, and platforms from a single interface. Tag once, access everywhere. Never lose track of where your files are.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; **v2.0.0-alpha.1 Released: December 26, 2025**
&gt;
&gt; This is Spacedrive v2—a complete ground-up rewrite. After development of the original alpha version stopped in January this year, I rebuilt Spacedrive from scratch with the hard lessons learned.
&gt;
&gt; **Current status:** Alpha release for macOS and Linux. Windows support coming in alpha.2. Mobile apps (iOS/Android) coming soon.
&gt;
&gt; **[Download Release](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.1)** · Visit [v2.spacedrive.com](https://v2.spacedrive.com) for complete documentation and guides.
&gt;
&gt; If you&#039;re looking for the previous version, see the [v1 branch](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/tree/v1).

## The Problem

Computing was designed for a single-device world. The file managers we use today—Finder, Explorer, Files—were built when your data lived in one place: the computer in front of you.

The shift to multi-device computing forced us into cloud ecosystems. Want your files everywhere? Upload them to someone else&#039;s servers. The convenience came at a cost: **data ownership**. This wasn&#039;t accidental—centralization was the path of least resistance for solving multi-device sync.

Now AI is accelerating this trend. Cloud services offer intelligent file analysis and semantic search, but only if you upload your data to their infrastructure. As we generate more data and AI becomes more capable, we&#039;re giving away more and more to access basic computing conveniences.

**The current system isn&#039;t built for a world where:**

- You own multiple devices with underutilized compute and storage
- Local AI models are becoming competitive with cloud alternatives
- Privacy and data sovereignty matter
- You shouldn&#039;t have to choose between convenience and control

## The Vision

Spacedrive is infrastructure for the next era of computing. It&#039;s an architecture designed for multi-device environments from the ground up—not cloud services retrofitted with offline support, but local-first sync that scales to the cloud when you want it.

As local AI models improve, Spacedrive becomes the fabric that enables the same insights cloud services offer today, but running on hardware you already own, on data that never leaves your control. This is a long-term project correcting computing&#039;s trajectory toward centralization.

The file explorer interface is deliberate. Everyone understands it. It&#039;s seen the least innovation in decades. And it has the most potential when you bake distributed computing, content awareness, and local AI into something universally familiar.

## How It Works

Spacedrive treats files as **first-class objects with content identity**, not paths. A photo on your laptop and the same photo on your NAS are recognized as one piece of content. This enables:

- **Content-aware deduplication** - Track redundancy across all devices
- **Semantic search** - Find files in under 100ms across millions of entries
- **Transactional operations** - Preview conflicts, space savings, and outcomes before execution
- **Peer-to-peer sync** - No servers, no consensus protocols, no single point of failure
- **Offline-first** - Full functionality without internet, syncs when devices reconnect

Files stay where they are. Spacedrive just makes them universally addressable with rich metadata and cross-device intelligence.

---

## Architecture

Spacedrive is built on four core principles:

### 1. Virtual Distributed Filesystem (VDFS)

Files and folders become first-class objects with rich metadata, independent of their physical location. Every file gets a universal address (`SdPath`) that works across devices. Content-aware addressing means you can reference files by what they contain, not just where they live.

### 2. Content Identity System

Adaptive hashing (BLAKE3 with strategic sampling for large files) creates a unique fingerprint for every piece of content. This enables:

- **Deduplication**: Recognize identical files across devices
- **Redundancy tracking**: Know where your backups are
- **Content-based operations**: &quot;Copy this file from wherever it&#039;s available&quot;

### 3. Transactional Actions

Every file operation can be previewed before execution. See exactly what will happen—space savings, conflicts, estimated time—then approve or cancel. Operations become durable jobs that survive network interruptions and device restarts.

### 4. Leaderless Sync

Peer-to-peer synchronization without central coordinators. Device-specific data (your filesystem index) uses state replication. Shared metadata (tags, ratings) uses a lightweight HLC-ordered log with deterministic conflict resolution. No leader election, no single point of failure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.81+ ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Bun** 1.3+ ([bun.sh](https://bun.sh)) - For Tauri desktop app

### Quick Start with Desktop App (Tauri)

Spacedrive runs as a daemon (`sd-daemon`) that manages your libraries and P2P connections. The Tauri desktop app can launch its own daemon instance, or connect to a daemon started by the CLI.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive
cd spacedrive

# Install dependencies
bun install
cargo run -p xtask -- setup  # generates .cargo/config.toml with aliases
cargo build # builds all core and apps (including the daemon and cli)

# Copy dependencies into the debug Folder ( probably windows only )
Copy-Item -Path &quot;apps\.deps\lib\*.dll&quot; -Destination &quot;target\debug&quot; -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Copy-Item -Path &quot;apps\.deps\bin\*.dll&quot; -Destination &quot;target\debug&quot; -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Run the desktop app (automatically starts daemon)
cd apps/tauri
bun run tauri:dev
```

### Quick Start with CLI

The CLI can manage libraries and run a persistent daemon that other apps connect to:

```bash
# Build and run the CLI
cargo run -p sd-cli -- --help

# Start the daemon (runs in background)
cargo run -p sd-cli -- daemon start

# Create a library
cargo run -p sd-cli -- library create &quot;My Library&quot;

# Add a location to index
cargo run -p sd-cli -- location add ~/Documents

# Search indexed files
cargo run -p sd-cli -- search .

# Now launch Tauri app - it will connect to the running daemon
```

### Native Prototypes

Experimental native apps are available in `apps/ios/`, `apps/macos/`, and `apps/gpui-photo-grid/` but are not documented for public use. These prototypes explore platform-specific optimizations and alternative UI approaches.

### Running Tests

Spacedrive has a comprehensive test suite covering single-device operations and multi-device networking scenarios.

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run specific test
cargo test test_device_pairing --nocapture

# Run with detailed logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test test_name --nocapture

# Run core tests only
cargo test -p sd-core
```

See the [Testing Guide](https://v2.spacedrive.com/core/testing) for detailed documentation on:

- Integration test framework
- Multi-device subprocess testing
- Event monitoring patterns
- Test helpers and utilities

All integration tests are in `core/tests/` including device pairing, sync, file transfer, and job execution tests.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for specific package
cargo test -p sd-core

# Build CLI in release mode
cargo build -p sd-cli --release

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run lints
cargo clippy
```

## Privacy &amp; Security

Spacedrive is **local-first**. Your data stays on your devices.

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All P2P traffic encrypted via QUIC/TLS
- **At-Rest Encryption**: Libraries can be encrypted on disk (SQLCipher)
- **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking or analytics in the open source version
- **Self-Hostable**: Run your own relay servers and cloud cores
- **Data Sovereignty**: You control where your data lives

Optional cloud integration (Spacedrive Cloud) is available for backup and remote access, but it&#039;s never required. The cloud service runs unmodified Spacedrive core as a standard P2P device—no special privileges, no custom APIs.

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

## Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust

Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use
and expressive. Key features are:

- Lazy | Eager execution
- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Query optimization
- Multi-threaded
- Written in Rust
- SIMD
- Powerful expression API
- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL
- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Performance 🚀🚀

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming.

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

## Managed/Distributed Polars

Do you want a managed solution or scale out to distributed clusters? Consider our
[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars[rt64]`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars[rtcompat]`. This version of
Polars is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target
features.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you enable the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.48.0&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.71.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.48 to now  - Rust 1.71
 * 1.39 to 1.47 - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

[quiche] is an implementation of the QUIC transport protocol and HTTP/3 as
specified by the [IETF]. It provides a low level API for processing QUIC packets
and handling connection state. The application is responsible for providing I/O
(e.g. sockets handling) as well as an event loop with support for timers.

For more information on how quiche came about and some insights into its design
you can read a [post] on Cloudflare&#039;s blog that goes into some more detail.

Who uses quiche?
----------------

### Cloudflare

quiche powers Cloudflare edge network&#039;s [HTTP/3 support][cloudflare-http3]. The
[cloudflare-quic.com](https://cloudflare-quic.com) website can be used for
testing and experimentation.

### Android

Android&#039;s DNS resolver uses quiche to [implement DNS over HTTP/3][android-http3].

### curl

quiche can be [integrated into curl][curl-http3] to provide support for HTTP/3.

[cloudflare-http3]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/
[android-http3]: https://security.googleblog.com/2022/07/dns-over-http3-in-android.html
[curl-http3]: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md#quiche-version

Getting Started
---------------

### Command-line apps

Before diving into the quiche API, here are a few examples on how to use the
quiche tools provided as part of the [quiche-apps](apps/) crate.

After cloning the project according to the command mentioned in the [building](#building) section, the client can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-client -- https://cloudflare-quic.com/
```

while the server can be run as follows:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin quiche-server -- --cert apps/src/bin/cert.crt --key apps/src/bin/cert.key
```

(note that the certificate provided is self-signed and should not be used in
production)

Use the `--help` command-line flag to get a more detailed description of each
tool&#039;s options.

### Configuring connections

The first step in establishing a QUIC connection using quiche is creating a
[`Config`] object:

```rust
let mut config = quiche::Config::new(quiche::PROTOCOL_VERSION)?;
config.set_application_protos(&amp;[b&quot;example-proto&quot;]);

// Additional configuration specific to application and use case...
```

The [`Config`] object controls important aspects of the QUIC connection such
as QUIC version, ALPN IDs, flow control, congestion control, idle timeout
and other properties or features.

QUIC is a general-purpose transport protocol and there are several
configuration properties where there is no reasonable default value. For
example, the permitted number of concurrent streams of any particular type
is dependent on the application running over QUIC, and other use-case
specific concerns.

quiche defaults several properties to zero, applications most likely need
to set these to something else to satisfy their needs using the following:

- [`set_initial_max_streams_bidi()`]
- [`set_initial_max_streams_uni()`]
- [`set_initial_max_data()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote()`]
- [`set_initial_max_stream_data_uni()`]

[`Config`] also holds TLS configuration. This can be changed by mutators on
the an existing object, or by constructing a TLS context manually and
creating a configuration using [`with_boring_ssl_ctx_builder()`].

A configuration object can be shared among multiple connections.

### Connection setup

On the client-side the [`connect()`] utility function can be used to create
a new connection, while [`accept()`] is for servers:

```rust
// Client connection.
let conn = quiche::connect(Some(&amp;server_name), &amp;scid, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;

// Server connection.
let conn = quiche::accept(&amp;scid, None, local, peer, &amp;mut config)?;
```

### Handling incoming packets

Using the connection&#039;s [`recv()`] method the application can process
incoming packets that belong to that connection from the network:

```rust
let to = socket.local_addr().unwrap();

loop {
    let (read, from) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();

    let recv_info = quiche::RecvInfo { from, to };

    let read = match conn.recv(&amp;mut buf[..read], recv_info) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };
}
```

### Generating outgoing packets

Outgoing packet are generated using the connection&#039;s [`send()`] method
instead:

```rust
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

When packets are sent, the application is responsible for maintaining a
timer to react to time-based connection events. The timer expiration can be
obtained using the connection&#039;s [`timeout()`] method.

```rust
let timeout = conn.timeout();
```

The application is responsible for providing a timer implementation, which
can be specific to the operating system or networking framework used. When
a timer expires, the connection&#039;s [`on_timeout()`] method should be called,
after which additional packets might need to be sent on the network:

```rust
// Timeout expired, handle it.
conn.on_timeout();

// Send more packets as needed after timeout.
loop {
    let (write, send_info) = match conn.send(&amp;mut out) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,

        Err(quiche::Error::Done) =&gt; {
            // Done writing.
            break;
        },

        Err(e) =&gt; {
            // An error occurred, handle it.
            break;
        },
    };

    socket.send_to(&amp;out[..write], &amp;send_info.to).unwrap();
}
```

#### Pacing

It is recommended that applications [pace] sending of outgoing packets to
avoid creating packet bursts that could cause short-term congestion and
losses in the network.

quiche exposes pacing hints for outgoing packets through the [`at`] field
of the [`SendInfo`] structure that is returned by the [`send()`] method.
This field represents the time when a specific packet should be sent into
the network.

Applications can use these hints by artificially delaying the sending of
packets through platform-specific mechanisms (such as the [`SO_TXTIME`]
socket option on Linux), or custom methods (for example by using user-space
timers).

[pace]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9002#section-7.7
[`SO_TXTIME`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-etf.8.html

### Sending and receiving stream data

After some back and forth, the connection will complete its handshake and
will be ready for sending or receiving application data.

Data can be sent on a stream by using the [`stream_send()`] method:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Handshake completed, send some data on stream 0.
    conn.stream_send(0, b&quot;hello&quot;, true)?;
}
```

The application can check whether there are any readable streams by using
the connection&#039;s [`readable()`] method, which returns an iterator over all
the streams that have outstanding data to read.

The [`stream_recv()`] method can then be used to retrieve the application
data from the readable stream:

```rust
if conn.is_established() {
    // Iterate over readable streams.
    for stream_id in conn.readable() {
        // Stream is readable, read until there&#039;s no more data.
        while let Ok((read, fin)) = conn.stream_recv(stream_id, &amp;mut buf) {
            println!(&quot;Got {} bytes on stream {}&quot;, read, stream_id);
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP/3

The quiche [HTTP/3 module] provides a high level API for sending and
receiving HTTP requests and responses on top of the QUIC transport protocol.

Have a look at the [quiche/examples/] directory for more complete examples on
how to use the quiche API, including examples on how to use quiche in C/C++
applications (see below for more information).

Calling quiche from C/C++
-------------------------

quiche exposes a [thin C API] on top of the Rust API that can be used to more
easily integrate quiche into C/C++ applications (as well as in other languages
that allow calling C APIs via some form of FFI). The C API follows the same
design of the Rust one, modulo the constraints imposed by the C language itself.

When running ``cargo build``, a static library called ``libquiche.a`` will be
built automatically alongside the Rust one. This is fully stand-alone and can
be linked directly into C/C++ applications.

Note that in order to enable the FFI API, the ``ffi`` feature must be enabled (it
is disabled by default), by passing ``--features ffi`` to ``cargo``.

[thin C API]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/quiche/include/quiche.h

Building
--------

quiche requires Rust 1.85 or later to build. The latest stable Rust release can
be installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once the Rust build environment is setup, the quiche source code can be fetched
using git:

```bash
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
```

and then built using cargo:

```bash
 $ cargo build --examples
```

cargo can also be used to run the testsuite:

```bash
 $ cargo test
```

Note that [BoringSSL], which is used to implement QUIC&#039;s cryptographic handshake
based on TLS, needs to be built and linked to quiche. This is done automatically
when building quiche using cargo, but requires the `cmake` command to be
available during the build process. On Windows you also need
[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/). The [official BoringSSL
documentation](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md) has
more details.

In alternative you can use your own custom build of BoringSSL by configuring
the BoringSSL directory with the ``QUICHE_BSSL_PATH`` environment variable:

```bash
 $ QUICHE_BSSL_PATH=&quot;/path/to/boringssl&quot; cargo build --examples
```

Alternatively you can use [OpenSSL/quictls]. To enable quiche to use this vendor
the ``openssl`` feature can be added to the ``--feature`` list. Be aware that
``0-RTT`` is not supported if this vendor is used.

[OpenSSL/quictls]: https://github.com/quictls/openssl

### Building for Android

Building quiche for Android (NDK version 19 or higher, 21 recommended), can be
done using [cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later).

First the [Android NDK] needs to be installed, either using Android Studio or
directly, and the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the
NDK installation path, e.g.:

```bash
 $ export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

Then the Rust toolchain for the Android architectures needed can be installed as
follows:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Note that the minimum API level is 21 for all target architectures.

[cargo-ndk] (v2.0 or later) also needs to be installed:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-ndk
```

Finally the quiche library can be built using the following procedure. Note that
the `-t &lt;architecture&gt;` and `-p &lt;NDK version&gt;` options are mandatory.

```bash
 $ cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -p 21 -- build --features ffi
```

See [build_android_ndk19.sh] for more information.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/ndk
[cargo-ndk]: https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-ndk
[build_android_ndk19.sh]: https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/blob/master/tools/android/build_android_ndk19.sh

### Building for iOS

To build quiche for iOS, you need the following:

- Install Xcode command-line tools. You can install them with Xcode or with the
  following command:

```bash
 $ xcode-select --install
```

- Install the Rust toolchain for iOS architectures:

```bash
 $ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

- Install `cargo-lipo`:

```bash
 $ cargo install cargo-lipo
```

To build libquiche, run the following command:

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi
```

or

```bash
 $ cargo lipo --features ffi --release
```

iOS build is tested in Xcode 10.1 and Xcode 11.2.

### Building Docker images

In order to build the Docker images, simply run the following command:

```bash
 $ make docker-build
```

You can find the quiche Docker images on the following Docker Hub repositories:

- [cloudflare/quiche](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche)
- [cloudflare/quiche-qns](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudflare/quiche-qns)

The `latest` tag will be updated whenever quiche master branch updates.

**cloudflare/quiche**

Provides a server and client installed in /usr/local/bin.

**cloudflare/quiche-qns**

Provides the script to test quiche within the [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner).

### RustFS vs Other Object Storage

| Feature | RustFS | Other Object Storage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Console Experience** | **Powerful Console**&lt;br&gt;Comprehensive management interface. | **Basic / Limited Console**&lt;br&gt;Often overly simple or lacking critical features. |
| **Language &amp; Safety** | **Rust-based**&lt;br&gt;Memory safety by design. | **Go or C-based**&lt;br&gt;Potential for memory GC pauses or leaks. |
| **Data Sovereignty** | **No Telemetry / Full Compliance**&lt;br&gt;Guards against unauthorized cross-border data egress. Compliant with GDPR (EU/UK), CCPA (US), and APPI (Japan). | **Potential Risk**&lt;br&gt;Possible legal exposure and unwanted data telemetry. |
| **Licensing** | **Permissive Apache 2.0**&lt;br&gt;Business-friendly, no &quot;poison pill&quot; clauses. | **Restrictive AGPL v3**&lt;br&gt;Risk of license traps and intellectual property pollution. |
| **Compatibility** | **100% S3 Compatible**&lt;br&gt;Works with any cloud provider or client, anywhere. | **Variable Compatibility**&lt;br&gt;May lack support for local cloud vendors or specific APIs. |
| **Edge &amp; IoT** | **Strong Edge Support**&lt;br&gt;Ideal for secure, innovative edge devices. | **Weak Edge Support**&lt;br&gt;Often too heavy for edge gateways. |
| **Risk Profile** | **Enterprise Risk Mitigation**&lt;br&gt;Clear IP rights and safe for commercial use. | **Legal Risks**&lt;br&gt;Intellectual property ambiguity and usage restrictions. |

## Quickstart

To get started with RustFS, follow these steps:

### 1. One-click Installation (Option 1)

  ```bash
  curl -O https://rustfs.com/install_rustfs.sh &amp;&amp; bash install_rustfs.sh
````

### 2\. Docker Quick Start (Option 2)

The RustFS container runs as a non-root user `rustfs` (UID `10001`). If you run Docker with `-v` to mount a host directory, please ensure the host directory owner is set to `10001`, otherwise you will encounter permission denied errors.

```bash
 # Create data and logs directories
 mkdir -p data logs

 # Change the owner of these directories
 chown -R 10001:10001 data logs

 # Using latest version
 docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:latest

 # Using specific version
 docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/logs:/logs rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0-alpha.76
```

You can also use Docker Compose. Using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory:

```bash
docker compose --profile observability up -d
```

**NOTE**: We recommend reviewing the `docker-compose.yaml` file before running. It defines several services including Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger, which are helpful for RustFS observability. If you wish to start Redis or Nginx containers, you can specify the corresponding profiles.

### 3\. Build from Source (Option 3) - Advanced Users

For developers who want to build RustFS Docker images from source with multi-architecture support:

```bash
# Build multi-architecture images locally
./docker-buildx.sh --build-arg RELEASE=latest

# Build and push to registry
./docker-buildx.sh --push

# Build specific version
./docker-buildx.sh --release v1.0.0 --push

# Build for custom registry
./docker-buildx.sh --registry your-registry.com --namespace yourname --push
```

The `docker-buildx.sh` script supports:
\- **Multi-architecture builds**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
\- **Automatic version detection**: Uses git tags or commit hashes
\- **Registry flexibility**: Supports Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
\- **Build optimization**: Includes caching and parallel builds

You can also use Make targets for convenience:

```bash
make docker-buildx                    # Build locally
make docker-buildx-push               # Build and push
make docker-buildx-version VERSION=v1.0.0  # Build specific version
make help-docker                      # Show all Docker-related commands
```

&gt; **Heads-up (macOS cross-compilation)**: macOS keeps the default `ulimit -n` at 256, so `cargo zigbuild` or `./build-rustfs.sh --platform ...` may fail with `ProcessFdQuotaExceeded` when targeting Linux. The build script attempts to raise the limit automatically, but if you still see the warning, run `ulimit -n 4096` (or higher) in your shell before building.

### 4\. Build with Helm Chart (Option 4) - Cloud Native

Follow the instructions in the [Helm Chart README](https://charts.rustfs.com/) to install RustFS on a Kubernetes cluster.

### 5\. Nix Flake (Option 5)

If you have [Nix with flakes enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes):

```bash
# Run directly without installing
nix run github:rustfs/rustfs

# Build the binary
nix build github:rustfs/rustfs
./result/bin/rustfs --help

# Or from a local checkout
nix build
nix run
```

-----

### Accessing RustFS

5.  **Access the Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9001` to access the RustFS console.
      * Default credentials: `rustfsadmin` / `rustfsadmin`
6.  **Create a Bucket**: Use the console to create a new bucket for your objects.
7.  **Upload Objects**: You can upload files directly through the console or use S3-compatible APIs/clients to interact with your RustFS instance.

**NOTE**: To access the RustFS instance via `https`, please refer to the [TLS Configuration Docs](https://docs.rustfs.com/integration/tls-configured.html).

## Versioning and Release Cycle

Tinymist’s versions follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme, in format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Besides, tinymist follows special rules for the version number:

- If a version is suffixed with `-rcN` (&lt;picture&gt;
  
  &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot; srcset=&quot;assets/images/introduction/frame_0.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/introduction/frame_1.svg&quot; alt=&quot;typst-frame&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;/picture&gt;), e.g. `0.11.0-rc1` and `0.12.1-rc1`, it means this version is a release candidate. It is used to test publish script and E2E functionalities. These versions will not be published to the marketplace.
- If the `PATCH` number is odd, e.g. `0.11.1` and `0.12.3`, it means this version is a nightly release. The nightly release will use both [tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/main) and [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst/tree/main) at **main branch**. They will be published as prerelease version to the marketplace. Note that in nightly releases, we change `#sys.version` to the next minor release to help develop documents with nightly features. For example, in tinymist nightly v0.12.1 or v0.12.3, the `#sys.version` is changed to `version(0, 13, 0)`.
- Otherwise, if the `PATCH` number is even, e.g. `0.11.0` and `0.12.2`, it means this version is a regular release. The regular release will always use the recent stable version of tinymist and typst.

The release cycle is as follows:

- If there is a typst version update, a new major or minor version will be released intermediately. This means tinymist will always align the minor version with typst.
- If there is at least a bug or feature added this week, a new patch version will be released.

## Installing Regular/Nightly Prebuilds from GitHub

Note: if you are not knowing what is a regular/nightly release, please don’t follow this section.

Besides published releases specific for each editors, you can also download the latest regular/nightly prebuilts from GitHub and install them manually.

- Regular prebuilts can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/releases).
- Nightly prebuilts can be found in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/actions).
  - (Suggested) Use the [tinymist-nightly-installer](https://github.com/hongjr03/tinymist-nightly-installer) to install the nightly prebuilts automatically.
    - Unix (Bash):
      ```bash
      curl -sSL https://github.com/hongjr03/tinymist-nightly-installer/releases/latest/download/run.sh | bash
      ```
    - Windows (PowerShell):
      ```bash
      iwr https://github.com/hongjr03/tinymist-nightly-installer/releases/latest/download/run.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
      ```
  - The prebuilts for other revisions can also be found manually. For example, if you are seeking a nightly release for the featured [PR: build: bump version to 0.11.17-rc1](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pull/468), you could click and go to the [action page](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/actions/runs/10120639466) run for the related commits and download the artifacts.

To install extension file (the file with `.vsix` extension) manually, please &lt;kbd&gt;

Ctrl+Shift+X

&lt;/kbd&gt; in the editor window and drop the downloaded vsix file into the opened extensions view.

## Roadmap

### Short Terms

To encourage contributions, we create many [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/pulls) in draft to navigate short-term plans. They give you a hint of what or where to start in this large repository.

### Long Terms

We are planning to implement the following features in typst v0.14.0 or spare time in weekend:

- Type checking: complete the type checker.
- Periscope renderer: It is disabled since vscode reject to render SVGs containing foreignObjects.
- Inlay hint: It is disabled _by default_ because of performance issues.
- Find references of dictionary fields and named function arguments.
- Improve symbol view’s appearance.
- Improve package view.
  - Navigate to symbols by clicking on the symbol name in the view.
  - Automatically locate the symbol item in the view when viewing local documentation.
  - Remember the recently invoked package commands, e.g. “Open Docs of @preview/cetz:0.3.1”, “Open directory of @preview/touying:0.5.3”.
- Improve label view.
  - Group labels.
  - Search labels.
  - Keep (persist) group preferences.
- Improve Typst Preview.
  - Pin drop-down: Set the file to preview in the drop-down for clients that doesn’t support passing arguments to the preview command.
  - Render in web worker (another thread) to reduce overhead on the electron’s main thread.
- Spell checking: There is already a branch but no suitable (default) spell checking library is found.
  - [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) is great for typst. [harper](https://github.com/Automattic/harper) looks promise.

If you are interested by any above features, please feel free to send Issues to discuss or PRs to implement to [GitHub.](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Universal Android Debloater GUI

**DISCLAIMER**: Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything that
could happen to your phone.

&lt;img src=&quot;/resources/screenshots/v0.5.0.png&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; alt=&quot;uad_screenshot&quot;&gt;

**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and feel free to contribute!**

## Summary

This is a complete rewrite in Rust of the [UAD project](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater),
which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary
and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improve security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

Packages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better
understanding of what you can delete or not. The worst issue that could happen
is removing an essential system package needed during boot causing then an unfortunate
bootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot
in recovery mode, and you&#039;ll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. Make a backup first!

In any case, you **CANNOT** brick your device with this software!
That&#039;s the main point, right?

## Features

- [x] Uninstall/Disable and Restore/Enable system packages
- [x] Multi-user support (e.g. apps in work profiles)
- [x] Export/Import your selection in `uad_exported_selection.txt`
- [x] Multi-device support: you can connect multiple phones at the same time
- [x] All your actions are logged, so you never forget what you&#039;ve done

NB : System apps cannot truly be uninstalled without root (see the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ))

## How to use it

- **Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/wiki/FAQ)!**
- **Do a proper backup of your data! You can never be too careful!**
- Enable _Developer Options_ on your smartphone.
- Turn on _USB Debugging_ from the developer panel.
- From the settings, disconnect from any OEM accounts (when you delete an OEM
  account package it could lock you on the lockscreen because the phone can&#039;t
  associate your identity anymore)
- Install ADB (see the intructions by clicking on your OS below):
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;LINUX&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install _Android platform tools_ on your PC :

  Debian Base:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools
  ```

  Arch-Linux Base:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S android-tools
  ```

  Red Hat Base:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install android-tools
  ```

  OpenSUSE Base:

  ```bash
  sudo zypper install android-tools
  ```

  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;MAC OS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - Install _Android platform tools_

    ```bash
    brew install android-platform-tools
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;WINDOWS&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Download [android platform tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
    and unzip it somewhere.
  - [Add the android platform tools to your PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
    **OR** make sure to launch UAD from the same directory.

  - [Install USB drivers for your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#Drivers)
  - Check your device is detected:

    ```bash
     adb devices
    ```

    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

- Download the latest release of UAD GUI for your Operating System [here](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases).
  Take the `opengl` version only if the default version (with a Vulkan backend)
  doesn&#039;t launch.

**NOTE:** Chinese phones users may need to use the AOSP list for removing some stock
apps because those Chinese manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) have been
using the name of AOSP packages for their own (modified &amp; closed-source) apps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to run this software whenever your OEM pushes
an update to your phone as some _uninstalled_ system apps could be reinstalled.

# Features

- Multiplatform (Linux, Windows, MacOs)
- Wifi and USB support
- Noise Cancellation
- Audio wave visualization
- Advanced Audio Options

# How to Use

## PC Side

- **1. Start the app**: Download and install the latest release. Then start the app.
    &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;
    More about installation
    &lt;/summary&gt;

  On macOS, you will need to run the following command to allow the app to run. For more details, refer to this [link](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860?sortBy=best):

  ```sh
  xattr -c /Applications/AndroidMic.app
  ```

    &lt;/details&gt;

- **2. Pick an output audio device**: You will see a list of audio player devices from the dropdown list. Here you want to choose a device that is wired to the virtual mic device on your system that you will be using.

    &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;
    More about output device
    &lt;/summary&gt;

  The step is system independent.

  On Windows you can use [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/download.htm) or [VB Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). Both software will install virtual input and output audio devices on your system. After that map the output player device to the input mic device so any audio our app played to the device is transferred to the virtual mic device.

  On Linux you can use pulseaudio to create a virtual mic device.

    &lt;/details&gt;

- **3. Choose a connection method**: This is how your phone will be connected to your PC and stream audio from the mic.

  For TCP &amp; UDP, connect your phone and PC to the same internet.

  For USB serial, connect your phone to PC with a cable.

    &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;
    More about USB serial
    &lt;/summary&gt;

  This option also requires configurations that are system independent.

  On Windows, make sure the adb process is shutdown and android studio is closed.

  On MacOS, it should just work.

  On Linux, you will need to configure [udev](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/FAQ#can-i-run-libusb-applications-on-linux-without-root-privilege) so that the app has permission to use USB.

  Samsung phone users may need to use [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to change the USB driver to WinUSB. This is because by default Samsung phones use its proprietary USB driver which is not compatible with the app.

    &lt;/details&gt;

  For USB adb, make sure the system has installed [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb). The connect your phone to PC.

- **4. Configure advanced settings**: Click to open the advanced settings window, and pick an audio format the output audio device supports. Usually sample rate of 44.1k or 48k, mono channel, and i16 or i24 are supported.

## Android Side

- **1. Start the app**: Download and install the apk file from release page. Then open the app.

- **2. Configure the app**: Open the side drawer menu, configure the connection method according to the option on PC app. Then pick the **same audio settings** as the ones in PC app advanced settings.

- **3. Connect**: First start recording and give sufficient permissions. Recording permission for accessing your phone&#039;s mic. Notification permission so the app can let you know if it is still recording in the background. Then connect to the PC app.

    &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;More about connection configurations&lt;/summary&gt;

  For TCP/UDP, you will need to enter the PC address and port. You can find that information from the log area on PC app.

  For USB adb, set your phone to developer mode and enable USB debugging.

  For USB serial, make sure your phone&#039;s USB setting is charging only. With this option, the app will ask your permission to launch the app in accessory mode.

    &lt;/details&gt;

For more question / feature request / bug report, please [submit an issues](https://github.com/teamclouday/AndroidMic/issues).

## Some Notes

The PC app started as a WPF app written in C# and was only supported on Windows. Now most of the features are recreated in Rust app thanks to @wiiznokes and it&#039;s cross platform supported. But here&#039;s the [link to the WPF app branch](https://github.com/teamclouday/AndroidMic/tree/wpf-app-backup) in case you are interested.

Bluetooth is no longer supported because USB serial is made possible.

Windows defender will very often identify the app as a virus, with their ML algorithm. If that happens, please [report to Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission) to get it fixed.</pre>
