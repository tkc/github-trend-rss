uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.


&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.82.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and Gnu Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup and styles and see the results in real time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioxusLabs/screenshots/refs/heads/main/blitz/hotreload-video.webp&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;video src=&quot;https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/10237910/386919031-6da371d5-3340-46da-84ff-628216851ba6.mov&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;video src=&quot;https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/10237910/386919031-6da371d5-3340-46da-84ff-628216851ba6.mov&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt; --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/bundle.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Fantastic documentation

We&#039;ve put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our Docs runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/) for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new Dioxus features - [check it out!](https://github.com/dioxusLabs/docsite)

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli. If you are running the git version of dioxus, you can install the matching version of the CLI with:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You just need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

## Dioxus vs other frameworks

We love all frameworks and enjoy watching innovation in the Rust ecosystem. In fact, many of our projects are shared with other frameworks. For example, our flex-box library [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) is used by [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/), [Lapce](https://lapce.dev/), [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced), and many more.

Dioxus places an emphasis on a few key points that make it different from other frameworks:

- **React-like**: we rely on concepts like components, props, and hooks to build UIs, with our state management being closer to Svelte than to SolidJS.
- **HTML and CSS**: we lean completely into HTML and CSS, quirks and all.
- **Renderer-agnostic**: you can swap out the renderer for any platform you want thanks to [our fast VirtualDOM](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/templates-diffing).
- **Collaborative**: whenever possible, we spin out crates like [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy), [manganis](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/manganis), [include_mdbook](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/include_mdbook), and [blitz](http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz) so the ecosystem can grow together.

### Dioxus vs Tauri

Tauri is a framework for building desktop mobile apps where your frontend is written in a web-based framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Whenever you need to do native work, you can write Rust functions and call them from your frontend.

- **Natively Rust**: Tauri&#039;s architecture limits your UI to either JavaScript or WebAssembly. With Dioxus, your Rust code is running natively on the user&#039;s machine, letting you do things like spawning threads, accessing the filesystem, without any IPC bridge. This drastically simplifies your app&#039;s architecture and makes it easier to build. You can build a Tauri app with Dioxus-Web as a frontend if you&#039;d like.

- **Different scopes**: Tauri needs to support JavaScript and its complex build tooling, limiting the scope of what you can do with it. Since Dioxus is exclusively focused on Rust, we&#039;re able to provide extra utilities like Server Functions, advanced bundling, and a native renderer.

- **Shared DNA**: While Tauri and Dioxus are separate projects, they do share libraries like Tao and Wry: windowing and webview libraries maintained by the Tauri team.

### Dioxus vs Leptos

Leptos is a library for building fullstack web-apps, similar to SolidJS and SolidStart. The two libraries share similar goals on the web, but have several key differences:

- **Reactivity model**: Leptos uses signals to drive both reactivity and rendering, while Dioxus uses signals just for reactivity. For managing re-renders, Dioxus uses a highly optimized VirtualDOM to support desktop and mobile architectures. Both Dioxus and Leptos are extremely fast.

- **Different scopes**: Dioxus provides renderers for web, desktop, mobile, LiveView, and more. We also maintain community libraries and a cross-platform SDK. Leptos has a tighter focus on the fullstack web with features that Dioxus doesn&#039;t have like islands, `&lt;Form /&gt;` components, and other web-specific utilities.

- **Different DSLs**: Dioxus uses its own custom Rust-like DSL for building UIs while Leptos uses an HTML-like syntax. We chose this to retain compatibility with IDE features like code-folding and syntax highlighting. Generally, Dioxus leans into more &quot;magic&quot; with its DSL including automatic formatting of strings and hot-reloading of simple Rust expressions.

```rust
// dioxus
rsx! {
  div {
    class: &quot;my-class&quot;,
    enabled: true,
    &quot;Hello, {name}&quot;
  }
}

// leptos
view! {
  &lt;div class=&quot;my-class&quot; enabled={true}&gt;
    &quot;Hello &quot;
    {name}
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
```

### Dioxus vs Yew

Yew is a framework for building single-page web apps and initially served as an inspiration for Dioxus. Unfortunately, the architecture of Yew didn&#039;t support the various features we wanted, and thus Dioxus was born.

- **Single-page apps**: Yew is designed exclusively for single-page web apps and is intrinsically tied to the web platform. Dioxus is fullstack and cross-platform, making it suitable for building web, desktop, mobile, and server apps.

- **Developer Tooling**: Dioxus provides a number of utilities like autoformatting, hot-reloading, and a bundler.

- **Ongoing support**: Dioxus is very actively maintained with new features and bug fixes being added on a daily basis.

### Dioxus vs egui

egui is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powering tools like [Rerun.io](https://www.rerun.io).

- **Immediate vs Retained**: egui is designed to be re-rendered on every frame. This is suitable for games and other interactive applications, but it does not retain style and layout state between frames. Dioxus is a retained UI framework, meaning that the UI is built once and then modified between frames. This enables Dioxus to use native web technologies like HTML and CSS with better battery life and performance.

- **Customizable**: egui brings its own styling and layout solution while Dioxus expects you to use the built-in HTML and CSS. This enables dioxus apps to use any CSS library like Tailwind or Material UI.

- **State management**: egui&#039;s state management is based on a single global state object. Dioxus encourages encapsulation of state by using components and props, making components more reusable.

### Dioxus vs Iced

Iced is a cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm. Iced renders natively with WGPU and supports the web using DOM nodes.

- **Elm state management**: Iced uses Elm&#039;s state management model, which is based on message passing and reducers. This is simply a different state management model than Dioxus and can be rather verbose at times.

- **Native Feel**: Since Dioxus uses a webview as its renderer, it automatically gets native text input, paste handling, and other native features like accessibility. Iced&#039;s renderer currently doesn&#039;t implement these features, making it feel less native.

- **WGPU**: Dioxus&#039; WGPU renderer is currently quite immature and not yet ready for production use. Iced&#039;s WGPU renderer is much more mature and is being used in production. This enables certain types of apps that need GPU access to be built with Iced that can&#039;t currently be built with Dioxus.

### Dioxus vs Electron

Dioxus and Electron are two entirely different projects with similar goals. Electron makes it possible for developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Lightweight**: Dioxus uses the system&#039;s native WebView - or optionally, a WGPU renderer - to render the UI. This makes a typical Dioxus app about 15mb on macOS in comparison to Electron&#039;s 100mb. Electron also ships an embedded chromium instance which cannot share system resources with the host OS in the same way as Dioxus.

- **Maturity**: Electron is a mature project with a large community and a lot of tooling. Dioxus is still quite young in comparison to Electron. Expect to run into features like deep-linking that require extra work to implement.

# Arnis [![CI Build Status](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/actions) [&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Release&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/louis-e/arnis&quot; /&gt;](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases) [&lt;img alt=&quot;GitHub Downloads (all assets, all releases&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/louis-e/arnis/total&quot; /&gt;](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases)

This open source project written in Rust generates any chosen location from the real world in Minecraft Java Edition with a high level of detail.

###### ⚠️ This Github page is the official project website. Do not download Arnis from any other website.

## :desktop_computer: Example
![Minecraft Preview](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/mc.gif?raw=true)

By leveraging geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and utilizing the powerful capabilities of Rust, Arnis provides an efficient and robust solution for creating complex and accurate Minecraft worlds that reflect real-world geography and architecture.

Arnis is designed to handle large-scale data and generate rich, immersive environments that bring real-world cities, landmarks, and natural features into the Minecraft universe. Whether you&#039;re looking to replicate your hometown, explore urban environments, or simply build something unique and realistic, Arnis generates your vision.

## :keyboard: Usage
&lt;img width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/gui.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/releases/) or [compile](#trophy-open-source) the project on your own.
 
Choose your area in Arnis using the rectangle tool and select your Minecraft world - then simply click on &#039;Start Generation&#039;!
The world will always be generated starting from the Minecraft coordinates 0 0 0 (/tp 0 0 0). This is the top left of your selected area.

To generate your world with terrain, make sure to enable the corresponding feature in the generation settings.

Minecraft version 1.16.5 and below is currently not supported, but we are working on it! For the best results, use Minecraft version 1.21.4.
If you choose to select an own world, be aware that Arnis will overwrite certain areas.

## :floppy_disk: How it works
![CLI Generation](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/blob/main/gitassets/cli.gif?raw=true)

The raw data obtained from the API *[(see FAQ)](#question-faq)* includes each element (buildings, walls, fountains, farmlands, etc.) with its respective corner coordinates (nodes) and descriptive tags. When you run Arnis, the following steps are performed automatically to generate a Minecraft world:

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Fetching Data from the Overpass API:** The script retrieves geospatial data for the desired bounding box from the Overpass API.
2. **Parsing Raw Data:** The raw data is parsed to extract essential information like nodes, ways, and relations. Nodes are converted into Minecraft coordinates, and relations are handled similarly to ways, ensuring all relevant elements are processed correctly. Relations and ways cluster several nodes into one specific object.
3. **Prioritizing and Sorting Elements:** The elements (nodes, ways, relations) are sorted by priority to establish a layering system, which ensures that certain types of elements (e.g., entrances and buildings) are generated in the correct order to avoid conflicts and overlapping structures.
4. **Generating Minecraft World:** The Minecraft world is generated using a series of element processors (generate_buildings, generate_highways, generate_landuse, etc.) that interpret the tags and nodes of each element to place the appropriate blocks in the Minecraft world. These processors handle the logic for creating 3D structures, roads, natural formations, and more, as specified by the processed data.
5. **Generating Ground Layer:** A ground layer is generated based on the provided scale factors to provide a base for the entire Minecraft world. This step ensures all areas have an appropriate foundation (e.g., grass and dirt layers).
6. **Saving the Minecraft World:** All the modified chunks are saved back to the Minecraft region files.

## :question: FAQ
- *Wasn&#039;t this written in Python before?*&lt;br&gt;
Yes! Arnis was initially developed in Python, which benefited from Python&#039;s open-source friendliness and ease of readability. This is why we strive for clear, well-documented code in the Rust port of this project to find the right balance. I decided to port the project to Rust to learn more about the language and push the algorithm&#039;s performance further. We were nearing the limits of optimization in Python, and Rust&#039;s capabilities allow for even better performance and efficiency. The old Python implementation is still available in the python-legacy branch.
- *Where does the data come from?*&lt;br&gt;
The geographic data is sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM)[^1], a free, collaborative mapping project that serves as an open-source alternative to commercial mapping services. The data is accessed via the Overpass API, which queries OSM&#039;s database. Other services like Google Maps do not provide data like this, which makes OSM perfect for this project.
- *How does the Minecraft world generation work?*&lt;br&gt;
The script uses the [fastnbt](https://github.com/owengage/fastnbt) cargo package to interact with Minecraft&#039;s world format. This library allows Arnis to manipulate Minecraft region files, enabling the generation of real-world locations. The section &#039;Processing Pipeline&#039; goes a bit further into the details and steps of the generation process itself.
- *Where does the name come from?*&lt;br&gt;
The project is named after the smallest city in Germany, Arnis[^2]. The city&#039;s small size made it an ideal test case for developing and debugging the algorithm efficiently.
- *I don&#039;t have Minecraft installed but want to generate a world for my kids. How?*&lt;br&gt;
When selecting a world, click on &#039;Select existing world&#039; and choose a directory. The world will be generated there.
- *Arnis instantly closes again or the window is empty!*&lt;br&gt;
  If you&#039;re on Windows, please install the [Evergreen Bootstrapper from Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH#download).

  If you&#039;re on Linux, your system might be missing the webkit2gtk-4.1 library, install the corresponding package using your distro&#039;s package manager.
- *What Minecraft version should I use?*&lt;br&gt;
Please use Minecraft version 1.21.4 for the best results. Minecraft version 1.16.5 and below is currently not supported, but we are working on it!
- *The generation did finish, but there&#039;s nothing in the world!*&lt;br&gt;
Make sure to teleport to the generation starting point (/tp 0 0 0). If there is still nothing, you might need to travel a bit further into the positive X and positive Z direction.
- *What features are in the world generation settings?*&lt;br&gt;
**Terrain:** Make sure to enable this feature to generate your world with elevation data included.&lt;br&gt;
**Winter Mode:** This setting changes the generation style to a snowy theme and adds snow layers to the ground.&lt;br&gt;
**Scale Factor:** The scale factor determines the size of the generated world.&lt;br&gt;
**Custom BBOX Input:** This setting allows you to manually input the bounding box coordinates for the area you want to generate.&lt;br&gt;
**Floodfill-Timeout (Sec):** This setting determines the maximum time the floodfill algorithm is allowed to run before being terminated. Increasing this value may improve the generation of large water areas but may also increase processing time.&lt;br&gt;
**Ground Height:** This setting determines the base height of the generated world and can be adjusted to create different terrain types.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it&#039;s best to check if there is an existing issue first. It&#039;s also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

### Documentation

Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust &amp; JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: &lt;https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs&gt;

## Usage

Winit is a window creation and management library. It can create windows and lets you handle
events (for example: the window being resized, a key being pressed, a mouse movement, etc.)
produced by the window.

Winit is designed to be a low-level brick in a hierarchy of libraries. Consequently, in order to
show something on the window you need to use the platform-specific getters provided by winit, or
another library.

## CONTRIBUING

## MSRV Policy

This crate&#039;s Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is **1.73**. Changes to
the MSRV will be accompanied by a minor version bump.

As a **tentative** policy, the upper bound of the MSRV is given by the following
formula:

```
min(sid, stable - 3)
```

Where `sid` is the current version of `rustc` provided by [Debian Sid], and
`stable` is the latest stable version of Rust. This bound may be broken in case of a major ecosystem shift or a security vulnerability.

[Debian Sid]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/rustc

An exception is made for the Android platform, where a higher Rust version
must be used for certain Android features. In this case, the MSRV will be
capped at the latest stable version of Rust minus three. This inconsistency is
not reflected in Cargo metadata, as it is not powerful enough to expose this
restriction.

Redox OS is also not covered by this MSRV policy, as it requires a Rust nightly
toolchain to compile.

All crates in the [`rust-windowing`] organizations have the
same MSRV policy.

[`rust-windowing`]: https://github.com/rust-windowing

**Czkawka** (_tch•kav•ka_ (IPA: [ˈʧ̑kafka]), &quot;hiccup&quot; in Polish) is a simple, fast and free app to remove unnecessary
files from your computer.

**Krokiet** ((IPA: [ˈkrɔcɛt]), &quot;croquet&quot; in Polish) same as above, but uses Slint frontend.

## Features

- Written in memory-safe Rust - almost 100% unsafe code free
- Amazingly fast - due to using more or less advanced algorithms and multithreading
- Free, Open Source without ads
- Multiplatform - works on Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD and many more
- Cache support - second and further scans should be much faster than the first one
- CLI frontend - for easy automation
- GUI frontend - uses GTK 4 or Slint frameworks
- No spying - Czkawka does not have access to the Internet, nor does it collect any user information or statistics
- Multilingual - support multiple languages like Polish, English or Italian
- Multiple tools to use:
    - Duplicates - Finds duplicates based on file name, size or hash
    - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of an advanced algorithm
    - Big Files - Finds the provided number of the biggest files in given location
    - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across the drive
    - Temporary Files - Finds temporary files
    - Similar Images - Finds images which are not exactly the same (different resolution, watermarks)
    - Similar Videos - Looks for visually similar videos
    - Same Music - Searches for similar music by tags or by reading content and comparing it
    - Invalid Symbolic Links - Shows symbolic links which point to non-existent files/directories
    - Broken Files - Finds files that are invalid or corrupted
    - Bad Extensions - Lists files whose content not match with their extension

## Usage, installation, compilation, requirements, license

Each tool uses different technologies, so you can find instructions for each of them in the appropriate file:

- [Czkawka GUI (GTK frontend)](czkawka_gui/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka CLI](czkawka_cli/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Czkawka Core](czkawka_core/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;
- [Krokiet GUI (Slint frontend)](krokiet/README.md)&lt;/br&gt;

## Comparison to other tools

Bleachbit is a master at finding and removing temporary files, while Czkawka only finds the most basic ones. So these
two apps shouldn&#039;t be compared directly or be considered as an alternative to one another.

In this comparison remember, that even if app have same features they may work different(e.g. one app may have more
options to choose than other).

## Other apps

There are many similar applications to Czkawka on the Internet, which do some things better and some things worse:

### GUI

- [DupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru) - Many options to customize; great photo compare tool
- [FSlint](https://github.com/pixelb/fslint) - A little outdated, but still have some tools not available in Czkawka
- [AntiDupl.NET](https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl) - Shows a lot of metadata of compared images
- [Video Duplicate Finder](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder) - Finds similar videos(surprising, isn&#039;t it), supports video thumbnails

### CLI

Due to limited time, the biggest emphasis is on the GUI version so if you are looking for really good and feature-packed
console apps, then take a look at these:

- [Fclones](https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones) - One of the fastest tools to find duplicates; it is written also in
  Rust
- [Rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint) - Nice console interface and also is feature packed
- [RdFind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind) - Fast, but written in C++ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome.

You can help by creating:

- Bug reports - memory leaks, unexpected behavior, crashes
- Feature proposals - proposal to change/add/delete some features
- Pull Requests - implementing a new feature yourself or fixing bugs.

## Thanks

Big thanks to Pádraig Brady, creator of fantastic FSlint, because without his work I wouldn&#039;t create this tool.

Thanks also to all the people who create patches for this program, make it available on other systems, create videos,
articles about it etc.

Also, I really appreciate work of people that create crates on which Czkawka is based and for that I try to report bugs
to make it even better.

## Donations

If you are using the app, I would appreciate a donation for its further development, which can be
done [here](https://github.com/sponsors/qarmin).

# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.rs) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that&#039;s built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor&#039;s tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies from the [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

To find out more see the [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), look
in the [docs/content](docs/content) folder of this repository or visit the [Zola community forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and its template engine [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.

## ⚓ Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is creating a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oxc is building a parser, linter, formatter, transformer, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

See more at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs)!

## VoidZero Inc.

Oxc is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/blog).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## 🙋Who&#039;s using Oxc?

- [Rolldown] uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing and transformation.
- [Nova engine](https://trynova.dev) uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing.
- [Rolldown][rolldown], [Biome][biome] and [swc-node](https://github.com/swc-project/swc-node) uses the [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] crate for module resolution.
- Projects and companies like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/4c20c23c16dd60f380ce9fe98afc93041a7e1562/oxlint.json), [Shopify](https://oxc.rs/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html#_50-100-times-faster-than-eslint), ByteDance and Shopee uses oxlint for linting.
- ...[and many more](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/projects.html)

## ⚡️ Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ⚡️ Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ⌨️ Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

While Rust has gained a reputation for its comparatively slower compilation speed,
we have dedicated significant effort to fine-tune the Rust compilation speed.
Our aim is to minimize any impact on your development workflow,
ensuring that developing your own Oxc based tools remains a smooth and efficient experience.

This is demonstrated by our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain),
where warm runs complete in 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

---

## 🎯 Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### 🔸 AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling,
any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.
By developing our parser, we have the opportunity to explore and implement well-researched performance techniques.

While many existing JavaScript tools rely on [estree] as their AST specification,
a notable drawback is its abundance of ambiguous nodes.
This ambiguity often leads to confusion during development with [estree].

The Oxc AST differs slightly from the [estree] AST by removing ambiguous nodes and introducing distinct types.
For example, instead of using a generic [estree] `Identifier`,
the Oxc AST provides specific types such as `BindingIdentifier`, `IdentifierReference`, and `IdentifierName`.
This clear distinction greatly enhances the development experience by aligning more closely with the ECMAScript specification.

#### 🏆 Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST is allocated in a memory arena (&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/bumpalo&quot;&gt;bumpalo&lt;/a&gt;) for fast AST memory allocation and deallocation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Short strings are inlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/compact_str&quot;&gt;CompactString&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No other heap allocations are done except the above two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scope binding, symbol resolution and some syntax errors are not done in the parser, they are delegated to the semantic analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### 🏆 Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oxc parser is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST visit is a fast operation due to linear memory scan from the memory arena.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Files are linted in a multi-threaded environment, so scales with the total number of CPU cores.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every single lint rule is tuned for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### 🔸 Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript and React transforms are complete. See [Milestone 2](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/2859) for current goals.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### 🔸 Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5-beta/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indications that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### 🔸 Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

### 🔸 Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_prettier) is currently work in progress.

## 🧪Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages

## Getting help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are a couple of channels for support:

* You can use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues) to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.
* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/discussions); if you have general
  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you&#039;re welcome here!
* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)
  for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions
than bug reports, but don&#039;t be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable
using and we&#039;ll work it out.

## Supporting the Project

If you use and like WezTerm, please consider sponsoring it: your support helps
to cover the fees required to maintain the project and to validate the time
spent working on it!

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

## The core BAML principle: LLM Prompts are functions

The fundamental building block in BAML is a function. Every prompt is a function that takes in parameters and returns a type.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; string
```

Every function additionally defines which models it uses and what its prompt is.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; StopTool | ReplyTool {
    client &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;

    prompt #&quot;
        Be a {{ tone }} bot.

        {{ ctx.output_format }}

        {% for m in message %}
        {{ _.role(m.role) }}
        {{ m.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    &quot;#
}

class Message {
    role string
    content string
}

class ReplyTool {
  response string
}

class StopTool {
  action &quot;stop&quot; @description(#&quot;
    when it might be a good time to end the conversation
  &quot;#)
}
```

Then in any language of your choice you can do the following:

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Message, StopTool

messages = [Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=&quot;How can I help?&quot;)]

while True:
  print(messages[-1].content)
  user_reply = input()
  messages.append(Message(role=&quot;user&quot;, content=user_reply))
  tool = b.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
  if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
    break
  else:
    messages.append(Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=tool.response))
```

### Making prompts easy to find and read

Since every prompt is a function, we can build tools to find every prompt you&#039;ve written. But we&#039;ve taken BAML one step further and built native tooling for VSCode (jetbrains + neovim coming soon).

1. You can see the full prompt (including any multi-modal assets)
![Multi Modal](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/2025-01-24-ai-agents-need-a-new-syntax/02-multi-modal.gif)
2. You can see the exact network request we are making
![Token Preview](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/2025-01-24-ai-agents-need-a-new-syntax/03-curl-token-preview.gif)
3. You can see every function you&#039;ve ever written

![Functions](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/2025-01-24-ai-agents-need-a-new-syntax/04-functions-preview.png)

### Swapping models: 1-line change

It&#039;s just 1 line (ok, maybe 2). [Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/switching-llms)

### Hot-reloading for prompts

Using AI is all about iteration speed.

If testing your pipeline takes 2 minutes, in 20 minutes, you can only test 10 ideas.

If testing your pipeline took 5 seconds, in 20 minutes, you can test 240 ideas.

Introducing testing, for prompts.

![Hot Reload](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/2025-01-24-ai-agents-need-a-new-syntax/07-hotreload.gif)

### Structured outputs with any LLM

JSON is amazing for REST APIs, but way too strict and verbose for LLMs. LLMs need something flexible. We created the SAP (schema-aligned parsing) algorithm to support the flexible outputs LLMs can provide, like markdown within a JSON blob or chain-of-thought prior to answering.

![Chain of Thought](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/2025-01-24-ai-agents-need-a-new-syntax/09-cot.gif)

SAP works with any model on day-1, without depending on tool-use or function-calling APIs.

To learn more about SAP you can read this post: [Schema-Aligned Parsing](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing).

See it in action with: [Deepseek-R1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/deepseek-r1-function-calling) and [OpenAI O1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/openai-o1).

### Streaming (when it&#039;s a first class citizen)

Streaming is way harder than it should be. With our [Python/Typescript/Ruby] generated code, streaming becomes natural and type-safe.

![Streaming](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/2025-01-24-ai-agents-need-a-new-syntax/10-streaming-client.gif#still)

### No strings attached

- 100% open-source (Apache 2)
- 100% private. AGI will not require an internet connection, neither will BAML
    - No network requests beyond model calls you explicitly set
    - Not stored or used for any training data
- BAML files can be saved locally on your machine and checked into Github for easy diffs.
- Built in Rust. So fast, you can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s there.

## BAML&#039;s Design Philosophy

Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

- **1:** Avoid invention when possible
    - Yes, prompts need versioning — we have a great versioning tool: git
    - Yes, you need to save prompts — we have a great storage tool: filesystems
- **2:** Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
- **3:** Be fast
- **4:** A first year university student should be able to understand it

## Why a new programming language

We used to write websites like this:

```python
def home():
    return &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;() =&gt; alert(\\\&quot;hello!\\\&quot;)\&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
```

And now we do this:

```jsx
function Home() {
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prev =&gt; prev + 1)}&gt;
          {count} clicks!
         &lt;/button&gt;
}
```

New syntax can be incredible at expressing new ideas. Plus the idea of maintaining hundreds of f-strings for prompts kind of disgusts us 🤮. Strings are bad for maintainable codebases. We prefer structured strings.

The goal of BAML is to give you the expressiveness of English, but the structure of code.

Full [blog post](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/ai-agents-need-new-syntax) by us.


## Conclusion

As models get better, we&#039;ll continue expecting even more out of them. But what will never change is that we&#039;ll want a way to write maintainable code that uses those models. The current way we all just assemble strings is very reminiscent of the early days PHP/HTML soup in web development. We hope some of the ideas we shared today can make a tiny dent in helping us all shape the way we all code tomorrow.

A rust implementation of [gRPC], a high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first.

[`tonic`] is a gRPC over HTTP/2 implementation focused on high performance, interoperability, and flexibility. This library was created to have first class support of async/await and to act as a core building block for production systems written in Rust.

[Examples] | [Website] | [Docs] | [Chat][discord]

## Overview

[`tonic`] is composed of three main components: the generic gRPC implementation, the high performance HTTP/2
implementation and the codegen powered by [`prost`]. The generic implementation can support any HTTP/2
implementation and any encoding via a set of generic traits. The HTTP/2 implementation is based on [`hyper`],
a fast HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 client and server built on top of the robust [`tokio`] stack. The codegen
contains the tools to build clients and servers from [`protobuf`] definitions.

## Features

- Bi-directional streaming
- High performance async io
- Interoperability
- TLS backed by [`rustls`]
- Load balancing
- Custom metadata
- Authentication
- Health Checking

## Getting Started

- The [`helloworld`][helloworld-tutorial] tutorial provides a basic example of using `tonic`, perfect for first time users!
- The [`routeguide`][routeguide-tutorial] tutorial provides a complete example of using `tonic` and all its features.

Examples can be found in [`examples`] and for more complex scenarios [`interop`]
may be a good resource as it shows examples of many of the gRPC features.

### Rust Version

`tonic`&#039;s MSRV is `1.75`.

### Dependencies

[`tonic-build`] uses `protoc` [Protocol Buffers compiler] in some APIs which compile Protocol Buffers resource files such as [`tonic_build::compile_protos()`].

[Protocol Buffers compiler]: https://protobuf.dev/downloads/
[`tonic_build::compile_protos()`]: https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/fn.compile_protos.html

## Getting Help

First, see if the answer to your question can be found in the API documentation.
If the answer is not there, there is an active community in
the [Tonic Discord channel][discord]. We would be happy to try to answer your
question. If that doesn&#039;t work, try opening an [issue] with the question.

# Rustlings 🦀❤️

&lt;/div&gt;

Greetings and welcome to Rustlings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Rustlings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust 📚️

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is another recommended resource that you might find helpful.
It contains code examples and exercises similar to Rustlings, but online.

## Getting Started

### Installing Rust

Before installing Rustlings, you need to have the **latest version of Rust** installed.
Visit [www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for further instructions on installing Rust.
This will also install _Cargo_, Rust&#039;s package/project manager.

&gt; 🐧 If you are on Linux, make sure you have installed `gcc` (for a linker).
&gt;
&gt; Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`
&gt;
&gt; Dnf: `sudo dnf install gcc`

&gt; 🍎 If you are on MacOS, make sure you have installed Xcode and its developer tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

### Installing Rustlings

The following command will download and compile Rustlings:

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the installation fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

- Make sure you have the latest Rust version by running `rustup update`
- Try adding the `--locked` flag: `cargo install rustlings --locked`
- Otherwise, please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new)

&lt;/details&gt;

### Initialization

After installing Rustlings, run the following command to initialize the `rustlings/` directory:

```bash
rustlings init
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the command &lt;code&gt;rustlings&lt;/code&gt; can&#039;t be found…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

You are probably using Linux and installed Rust using your package manager.

Cargo installs binaries to the directory `~/.cargo/bin`.
Sadly, package managers often don&#039;t add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.

The solution is to …

- either add `~/.cargo/bin` manually to `PATH`
- or to uninstall Rust from the package manager and install it using the official way with `rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

&lt;/details&gt;

Now, go into the newly initialized directory and launch Rustlings for further instructions on getting started with the exercises:

```bash
cd rustlings/
rustlings
```

## Working environment

### Editor

Our general recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [rust-analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
But any editor that supports [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) should be enough for working on the exercises.

### Terminal

While working with Rustlings, please use a modern terminal for the best user experience.
The default terminal on Linux and Mac should be sufficient.
On Windows, we recommend the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `exercises/&lt;topic&gt;`.
For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.
We highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start 📚️

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it&#039;s up to you to fix it!
Some exercises contain tests that need to pass for the exercise to be done ✅

Search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to find out what you need to change.
Ask for hints by entering `h` in the _watch mode_ 💡

### Watch Mode

After the [initialization](#initialization), Rustlings can be launched by simply running the command `rustlings`.

This will start the _watch mode_ which walks you through the exercises in a predefined order (what we think is best for newcomers).
It will rerun the current exercise automatically every time you change the exercise&#039;s file in the `exercises/` directory.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If detecting file changes in the &lt;code&gt;exercises/&lt;/code&gt; directory fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; You can add the **`--manual-run`** flag (`rustlings --manual-run`) to manually rerun the current exercise by entering `r` in the watch mode.
&gt;
&gt; Please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new) with some information about your operating system and whether you run Rustlings in a container or virtual machine (e.g. WSL).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Exercise List

In the [watch mode](#watch-mode) (after launching `rustlings`), you can enter `l` to open the interactive exercise list.

The list allows you to…

- See the status of all exercises (done or pending)
- `c`: Continue at another exercise (temporarily skip some exercises or go back to a previous one)
- `r`: Reset status and file of the selected exercise (you need to _reload/reopen_ its file in your editor afterwards)

See the footer of the list for all possible keys.

## Questions?

If you need any help while doing the exercises and the builtin-hints aren&#039;t helpful, feel free to ask in the [_Q&amp;A_ category of the discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=) if your question wasn&#039;t asked yet 💡

## Third-Party Exercises

Third-party exercises are a set of exercises maintained by the community.
You can use the same `rustlings` program that you installed with `cargo install rustlings` to run them:

- 🇯🇵 [Japanese Rustlings](https://github.com/sotanengel/rustlings-jp)：A Japanese translation of the Rustlings exercises.
- 🇨🇳 [Simplified Chinese Rustlings](https://github.com/SandmeyerX/rustlings-zh-cn): A simplified Chinese translation of the Rustlings exercises.

Do you want to create your own set of Rustlings exercises to focus on some specific topic?
Or do you want to translate the original Rustlings exercises?
Then follow the the guide about [third-party exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_EXERCISES.md)!

## Continuing On

Once you&#039;ve completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use!
Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Overview

libsignal contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, exposed
as a Java, Swift, or TypeScript library. The underlying implementations are written in Rust:

- libsignal-protocol: Implements the Signal protocol, including the [Double Ratchet algorithm][]. A
  replacement for [libsignal-protocol-java][] and [libsignal-metadata-java][].
- signal-crypto: Cryptographic primitives such as AES-GCM. We use [RustCrypto][]&#039;s where we can
  but sometimes have differing needs.
- device-transfer: Support logic for Signal&#039;s device-to-device transfer feature.
- attest: Functionality for remote attestation of [SGX enclaves][] and server-side [HSMs][].
- zkgroup: Functionality for [zero-knowledge groups][] and related features available in Signal.
- zkcredential: An abstraction for the sort of zero-knowledge credentials used by zkgroup, based on the paper &quot;[The Signal Private Group System][]&quot; by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha.
- poksho: Utilities for implementing zero-knowledge proofs (such as those used by zkgroup); stands for &quot;proof-of-knowledge, stateful-hash-object&quot;.
- account-keys: Functionality for consistently using [PINs][] as passwords in Signal&#039;s Secure Value Recovery system, as well as other account-wide key operations.
- usernames: Functionality for username generation, hashing, and proofs.
- media: Utilities for manipulating media.

This repository is used by the Signal client apps ([Android][], [iOS][], and [Desktop][]) as well as
server-side. Use outside of Signal is unsupported. In particular, the products of this repository
are the Java, Swift, and TypeScript libraries that wrap the underlying Rust implementations. All
APIs and implementations are subject to change without notice, as are the JNI, C, and Node add-on
&quot;bridge&quot; layers. However, backwards-incompatible changes to the Java, Swift, TypeScript, and
non-bridge Rust APIs will be reflected in the version number on a best-effort basis, including
increases to the minimum supported tools versions.

# Building

### Toolchain Installation

To build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed,
as well as Clang, libclang, [CMake](https://cmake.org), Make, protoc, and git.

#### Linux/Debian

On a Debian-like system, you can get these extra dependencies through `apt`:

```shell
$ apt-get install clang libclang-dev cmake make protobuf-compiler git
```

#### macOS

On macOS, we have a best-effort maintained script to set up the Rust toolchain you can run by:

```shell
$ bin/mac_setup.sh
```

## Rust

### First Build and Test

The build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which
will be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol
libraries:

```shell
$ cargo build
...
$ cargo test
...
```

### Additional Rust Tools

The basic tools above should get you set up for most libsignal Rust development. 

Eventually, you may find that you need some additional Rust tools like `cbindgen` to modify the bridges to the 
client libraries or `taplo` for code formatting. 

You should always install any Rust tools you need that may affect the build from cargo rather than from your system
package manager (e.g. `apt` or `brew`). Package managers sometimes contain outdated versions of these tools that can break
the build with incompatibility issues (especially cbindgen).

To install the main Rust extra dependencies matching the versions we use, you can run the following commands: 

```shell
$ cargo +stable install cbindgen cargo-fuzz
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat ../acknowledgments/cargo-about-version)&quot; --locked cargo-about
$ cargo +stable install --version &quot;$(cat ../.taplo-cli-version)&quot; --locked taplo-cli
```

## Java/Android

To build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,
the Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using

```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```

To build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:

```shell
$ cd java
$ ./gradlew test
$ ./gradlew build # if you need AAR outputs
```

You can pass `-P debugLevelLogs` to Gradle to build without filtering out debug- and verbose-level
logs from Rust.

Alternately, a build system using Docker is available:

```shell
$ cd java
$ make
```

When exposing new APIs to Java, you will need to run `rust/bridge/jni/bin/gen_java_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding. This requires installing the `cbindgen` Rust tool, as detailed above. 

### Maven Central

Signal publishes Java packages on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org) for its own use,
under the names org.signal:libsignal-server, org.signal:libsignal-client, and
org.signal:libsignal-android. libsignal-client and libsignal-server contain native libraries for
Debian-flavored x86_64 Linux as well as Windows (x86_64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64).
libsignal-android contains native libraries for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64 Android.

When building for Android you need *both* libsignal-android and libsignal-client, but the Windows
and macOS libraries in libsignal-client won&#039;t automatically be excluded from your final app. You can
explicitly exclude them using `packagingOptions`:

```
android {
  // ...
  packagingOptions {
    resources {
      excludes += setOf(&quot;libsignal_jni*.dylib&quot;, &quot;signal_jni*.dll&quot;)
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can additionally exclude `libsignal_jni_testing.so` if you do not plan to use any of the APIs
intended for client testing.


## Swift

To learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)


## Node

You&#039;ll need Node installed to build. If you have [nvm][], you can run `nvm use` to select an
appropriate version automatically.

We use `npm` as our package manager, and `node-gyp` to control building the Rust library.

```shell
$ cd node
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npx node-gyp rebuild  # clean-&gt;configure-&gt;build
$ npm run tsc
$ npm run test
```

When testing changes locally, you can use `npm run build` to do an incremental rebuild of the Rust library. Alternately, `npm run build-with-debug-level-logs` will rebuild without filtering out debug- and verbose-level logs.

When exposing new APIs to Node, you will need to run `rust/bridge/node/bin/gen_ts_decl.py` in
addition to rebuilding.

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

### NPM

Signal publishes the NPM package `@signalapp/libsignal-client` for its own use, including native
libraries for Windows, macOS, and Debian-flavored Linux. Both x64 and arm64 builds are included for
all three platforms, but the arm64 builds for Windows and Linux are considered experimental, since
there are no official builds of Signal for those architectures.


# Contributions

Signal does accept external contributions to this project. However unless the change is
simple and easily understood, for example fixing a bug or portability issue, adding a new
test, or improving performance, first open an issue to discuss your intended change as not
all changes can be accepted.

Contributions that will not be used directly by one of Signal&#039;s official client apps may still be
considered, but only if they do not pose an undue maintenance burden or conflict with the goals of
the project.

Signing a [CLA (Contributor License Agreement)](https://signal.org/cla/) is required for all contributions.

## Code Formatting and Acknowledgments

You can run the styler on the entire project by running:

```shell
just format-all
```

You can run more extensive tests as well as linters and clippy by running:

```shell
just check-pre-commit
```

When making a PR that adjusts dependencies, you&#039;ll need to regenerate our acknowledgments files. See [``acknowledgments/README.md``](acknowledgments/).

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. It’s based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc...).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you activated the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.44.1&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.70.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.39 to now  - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025. (MSRV 1.63)
 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.32.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.38&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
