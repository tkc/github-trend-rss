&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This project is no longer dormant and is [being
&gt; rebooted](https://rust-gpu.github.io/blog/2025/01/27/rust-cuda-reboot).
&gt; Please contribute!

## Goal

The Rust CUDA Project is a project aimed at making Rust a tier-1 language for extremely fast GPU computing
using the CUDA Toolkit. It provides tools for compiling Rust to extremely fast PTX code as well as libraries
for using existing CUDA libraries with it.

## Background

Historically, general purpose high performance GPU computing has been done using the CUDA toolkit. The CUDA toolkit primarily
provides a way to use Fortran/C/C++ code for GPU computing in tandem with CPU code with a single source. It also provides
many libraries, tools, forums, and documentation to supplement the single-source CPU/GPU code.

CUDA is exclusively an NVIDIA-only toolkit. Many tools have been proposed for cross-platform GPU computing such as
OpenCL, Vulkan Computing, and HIP. However, CUDA remains the most used toolkit for such tasks by far. This is why it is
imperative to make Rust a viable option for use with the CUDA toolkit.

However, CUDA with Rust has been a historically very rocky road. The only viable option until now has been to use the LLVM PTX
backend, however, the LLVM PTX backend does not always work and would generate invalid PTX for many common Rust operations, and
in recent years it has been shown time and time again that a specialized solution is needed for Rust on the GPU with the advent
of projects such as rust-gpu (for Rust -&gt; SPIR-V).

Our hope is that with this project we can push the Rust GPU computing industry forward and make Rust an excellent language
for such tasks. Rust offers plenty of benefits such as `__restrict__` performance benefits for every kernel, An excellent module/crate system,
delimiting of unsafe areas of CPU/GPU code with `unsafe`, high level wrappers to low level CUDA libraries, etc.

## Structure

The scope of the Rust CUDA Project is quite broad, it spans the entirety of the CUDA ecosystem, with libraries and tools to make it
usable using Rust. Therefore, the project contains many crates for all corners of the CUDA ecosystem.

The current line-up of libraries is the following:

- `rustc_codegen_nvvm` Which is a rustc backend that targets NVVM IR (a subset of LLVM IR) for the [libnvvm](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/index.html) library.
  - Generates highly optimized PTX code which can be loaded by the CUDA Driver API to execute on the GPU.
  - For the near future it will be CUDA-only, but it may be used to target amdgpu in the future.
- `cuda_std` for GPU-side functions and utilities, such as thread index queries, memory allocation, warp intrinsics, etc.
  - _Not_ a low level library, provides many utility functions to make it easier to write cleaner and more reliable GPU kernels.
  - Closely tied to `rustc_codegen_nvvm` which exposes GPU features through it internally.
- [`cudnn`](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/tree/master/crates/cudnn) for a collection of GPU-accelerated primitives for deep neural networks.
- `cust` for CPU-side CUDA features such as launching GPU kernels, GPU memory allocation, device queries, etc.
  - High level with features such as RAII and Rust Results that make it easier and cleaner to manage the interface to the GPU.
  - A high level wrapper for the CUDA Driver API, the lower level version of the more common CUDA Runtime API used from C++.
  - Provides much more fine grained control over things like kernel concurrency and module loading than the C++ Runtime API.
- `gpu_rand` for GPU-friendly random number generation, currently only implements xoroshiro RNGs from `rand_xoshiro`.
- `optix` for CPU-side hardware raytracing and denoising using the CUDA OptiX library.

In addition to many &quot;glue&quot; crates for things such as high level wrappers for certain smaller CUDA libraries.

&lt;br /&gt;

SQLx is an async, pure Rust&lt;sub&gt;†&lt;/sub&gt; SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

-   **Compile-time checked queries** (if you want). See [SQLx is not an ORM](#sqlx-is-not-an-orm).

-   **Database Agnostic**. Support for [PostgreSQL], [MySQL], [MariaDB], [SQLite].
    -   [MSSQL] was supported prior to version 0.7, but has been removed pending a full rewrite of the driver as part of our [SQLx Pro initiative].

-   **Pure Rust**. The Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB drivers are written in pure Rust using **zero** unsafe&lt;sub&gt;††&lt;/sub&gt; code.

-   **Runtime Agnostic**. Works on different runtimes ([`async-std`] / [`tokio`] / [`actix`]) and TLS backends ([`native-tls`], [`rustls`]).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;

† The SQLite driver uses the libsqlite3 C library as SQLite is an embedded database (the only way
we could be pure Rust for SQLite is by porting _all_ of SQLite to Rust).

†† SQLx uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the `sqlite` feature is enabled.
The SQLite driver directly invokes the SQLite3 API via `libsqlite3-sys`, which requires `unsafe`.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS) where supported ([MySQL], [MariaDB] and [PostgreSQL]).

-   Asynchronous notifications using `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for [PostgreSQL].

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

-   `Any` database driver for changing the database driver at runtime. An `AnyPool` connects to the driver indicated by the URL scheme.

## Install

SQLx is compatible with the [`async-std`], [`tokio`], and [`actix`] runtimes; and, the [`native-tls`] and [`rustls`] TLS backends. When adding the dependency, you must choose a runtime feature that is `runtime` + `tls`.

[`async-std`]: https://github.com/async-rs/async-std
[`tokio`]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio
[`actix`]: https://github.com/actix/actix-net
[`native-tls`]: https://crates.io/crates/native-tls
[`rustls`]: https://crates.io/crates/rustls

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
# PICK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

# tokio (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot; ] }
# tokio + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# tokio + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-tokio&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }

# async-std (no TLS)
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot; ] }
# async-std + native-tls
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-native-tls&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and WebPKI CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-webpki&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with ring and platform&#039;s native CA certificates
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-ring-native-roots&quot; ] }
# async-std + rustls with aws-lc-rs
sqlx = { version = &quot;0.8&quot;, features = [ &quot;runtime-async-std&quot;, &quot;tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs&quot; ] }
```

#### Cargo Feature Flags

For backward-compatibility reasons, the runtime and TLS features can either be chosen together as a single feature,
or separately.

For forward compatibility, you should use the separate runtime and TLS features as the combination features may
be removed in the future.

-   `runtime-async-std`: Use the `async-std` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-async-std-native-tls`: Use the `async-std` runtime and `native-tls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-async-std-rustls`: Use the `async-std` runtime and `rustls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-tokio`: Use the `tokio` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-tokio-native-tls`: Use the `tokio` runtime and `native-tls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-tokio-rustls`: Use the `tokio` runtime and `rustls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

    - Actix-web is fully compatible with Tokio and so a separate runtime feature is no longer needed.

-   `tls-native-tls`: Use the `native-tls` TLS backend (OpenSSL on *nix, SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS).

-   `tls-rustls`: Use the `rustls` TLS backend (cross-platform backend, only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

-   `postgres`: Add support for the Postgres database server.

-   `mysql`: Add support for the MySQL/MariaDB database server.

-   `mssql`: Add support for the MSSQL database server.

-   `sqlite`: Add support for the self-contained [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine with SQLite bundled and statically-linked.

-   `sqlite-unbundled`: The same as above (`sqlite`), but link SQLite from the system instead of the bundled version.
    * Allows updating SQLite independently of SQLx or using forked versions.
    * You must have SQLite installed on the system or provide a path to the library at build time.
       See [the `rusqlite` README](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-building-rusqlite-and-libsqlite3-sys) for details.
    * May result in link errors if the SQLite version is too old. Version `3.20.0` or newer is recommended.
    * Can increase build time due to the use of bindgen.

-   `sqlite-preupdate-hook`: enables SQLite&#039;s [preupdate hook](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/preupdate_count.html) API.
    * Exposed as a separate feature because it&#039;s generally not enabled by default.
    * Using this feature with `sqlite-unbundled` may cause linker failures if the system SQLite version does not support it.

-   `any`: Add support for the `Any` database driver, which can proxy to a database driver at runtime.

-   `derive`: Add support for the derive family macros, those are `FromRow`, `Type`, `Encode`, `Decode`.

-   `macros`: Add support for the `query*!` macros, which allows compile-time checked queries.

-   `migrate`: Add support for the migration management and `migrate!` macro, which allow compile-time embedded migrations.

-   `uuid`: Add support for UUID.

-   `chrono`: Add support for date and time types from `chrono`.

-   `time`: Add support for date and time types from `time` crate (alternative to `chrono`, which is preferred by `query!` macro, if both enabled)

-   `bstr`: Add support for `bstr::BString`.

-   `bigdecimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `bigdecimal` crate.

-   `rust_decimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `rust_decimal` crate.

-   `ipnetwork`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnetwork` crate.

-   `json`: Add support for `JSON` and `JSONB` (in postgres) using the `serde_json` crate.

-   Offline mode is now always enabled. See [sqlx-cli/README.md][readme-offline].

## SQLx is not an ORM!

SQLx supports **compile-time checked queries**. It does not, however, do this by providing a Rust
API or DSL (domain-specific language) for building queries. Instead, it provides macros that take
regular SQL as input and ensure that it is valid for your database. The way this works is that
SQLx connects to your development DB at compile time to have the database itself verify (and return
some info on) your SQL queries. This has some potentially surprising implications:

- Since SQLx never has to parse the SQL string itself, any syntax that the development DB accepts
  can be used (including things added by database extensions)
- Due to the different amount of information databases let you retrieve about queries, the extent of
  SQL verification you get from the query macros depends on the database

**If you are looking for an (asynchronous) ORM,** you can check out our new [Ecosystem wiki page](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/wiki/Ecosystem#orms)!

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder for more in-depth usage.

### Quickstart

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&quot;postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```


### Connecting

A single connection can be established using any of the database connection types and calling `connect()`.

```rust
use sqlx::Connection;

let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;
```

Generally, you will want to instead create a connection pool (`sqlx::Pool`) for the application to
regulate how many server-side connections it&#039;s using.

```rust
let pool = MySqlPool::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database&quot;).await?;
```

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&amp;str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute(&quot;BEGIN&quot;).await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;)).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row&lt;&#039;conn&gt;` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures::TryStreamExt;
// provides `try_get`
use sqlx::Row;

let mut rows = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;)
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &amp;str = row.try_get(&quot;email&quot;)?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, User&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?&quot;)
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.

### Compile-time verification

We can use the macro, `sqlx::query!` to achieve compile-time syntactic and semantic verification of the SQL, with
an output to an anonymous record type where each SQL column is a Rust field (using raw identifiers where needed).

```rust
let countries = sqlx::query!(
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;{ country: String, count: i64 }&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

Differences from `query()`:

-   The input (or bind) parameters must be given all at once (and they are compile-time validated to be
    the right number and the right type).

-   The output type is an anonymous record. In the above example the type would be similar to:

    ```rust
    { country: String, count: i64 }
    ```

-   The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build time to a database which it can prepare
    queries against; the database does not have to contain any data but must be the same
    kind (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) and have the same schema as the database you will be connecting to at runtime.

    For convenience, you can use [a `.env` file][dotenv]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to set DATABASE_URL so that you don&#039;t have to pass it every time:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://localhost/my_database
    ```

[dotenv]: https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv#examples

The biggest downside to `query!()` is that the output type cannot be named (due to Rust not
officially supporting anonymous records). To address that, there is a `query_as!()` macro that is
mostly identical except that you can name the output type.

```rust
// no traits are needed
struct Country { country: String, count: i64 }

let countries = sqlx::query_as!(Country,
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;Country&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

To avoid the need of having a development database around to compile the project even when no
modifications (to the database-accessing parts of the code) are done, you can enable &quot;offline mode&quot;
to cache the results of the SQL query analysis using the `sqlx` command-line tool. See
[sqlx-cli/README.md](./sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query).

Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like
`cargo check` and `cargo build` can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by
putting the following in your `Cargo.toml` (More information in the
[Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) of The Cargo Book)

```toml
[profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
opt-level = 3
```

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `dotenv` crate itself appears abandoned as of [December 2021](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/issues/74)
so we now use the `dotenvy` crate instead. The file format is the same.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% Safe Rust.

If the `sqlite` feature is enabled, this is downgraded to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` on the
`sqlx::sqlite` module. There are several places where we interact with the C SQLite API. We try to document each call for the invariants we&#039;re assuming. We absolutely welcome auditing of, and feedback on, our unsafe code usage.

&lt;a href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay&#039;s new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure.

Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:

* [Hyperswitch Backend](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch): Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.

* [SDK (Frontend)](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web): The SDK, available for web, [Android, and iOS](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-client-core), unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user&#039;s saved payment methods.    

* [Control Center](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-control-center): The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.

&gt; Linux for Payments

Payments are evolving rapidly worldwide, with hundreds of processors, fraud detection systems, authentication modules, and new payment methods and flows emerging. Businesses building or managing their own payment stacks often face similar challenges, struggle with comparable issues, and find it hard to innovate at the desired pace.

Hyperswitch serves as a well-architected designed reference platform, built on best-in-class design principles, empowering businesses to own and customize their payment stack. It provides a reusable core payments stack that can be tailored to specific requirements while relying on the Hyperswitch team for enhancements, support, and continuous innovation.

### Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found in the manual
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/contributing/building_from_source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

Enabling features is done by passing `--features ...` to the build system. When using `cargo run` or `maturin develop`, pass the `--features` flag before the `--` separating build flags from runtime flags.

- To enable a single feature like `metal`: `cargo build --release --features metal`.
- To enable multiple features, specify them in quotes: `cargo build --release --features &quot;cuda flash-attn cudnn&quot;`.

## Installation and Build

&gt; Note: You can use our [Docker containers here](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/pkgs/container/mistral.rs).
&gt; Learn more about running Docker containers: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/

- Install the [Python package here](mistralrs-pyo3/_README.md).
- The Python package has [wheels on PyPi](mistralrs-pyo3/_README.md#installation-from-pypi)!

1) Install required packages:
    - `OpenSSL` (*Example on Ubuntu:* `sudo apt install libssl-dev`)
    - &lt;b&gt;*Linux only:*&lt;/b&gt; `pkg-config` (*Example on Ubuntu:* `sudo apt install pkg-config`)

2) Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/

    *Example on Ubuntu:*
    ```bash
    curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

3) &lt;b&gt;*Optional:*&lt;/b&gt; Set HF token correctly (skip if already set or your model is not gated, or if you want to use the `token_source` parameters in Python or the command line.)
    - Note: you can install `huggingface-cli` as documented [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/installation). 
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

4) Download the code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs.git
    cd mistral.rs
    ```

5) Build or install:
    - Base build command
        ```bash
        cargo build --release
        ```
    - Build with CUDA support
        ```bash
        cargo build --release --features cuda
        ```
    - Build with CUDA and Flash Attention V2 support
        ```bash
        cargo build --release --features &quot;cuda flash-attn&quot;
        ```
    - Build with Metal support

        ```
    - Build with MKL support
        ```bash
        cargo build --release --features mkl
        ```
    - Install with `cargo install` for easy command line usage

        Pass the same values to `--features` as you would for `cargo build`
        ```bash
        cargo install --path mistralrs-server --features cuda
        ```
6) The build process will output a binary `mistralrs-server` at `./target/release/mistralrs-server`. We can switch to that directory so that the binary can be accessed as `./mistralrs-server` with the following command:

    *Example on Ubuntu:*
    ```
    cd target/release
    ```

7) Use our APIs and integrations:

## Getting models

There are 2 ways to get models with mistral.rs:
- From Hugging Face Hub (easiest)
- From local files
    - Running a GGUF model
    - Specify local paths

### Getting models from Hugging Face Hub

Mistral.rs can automatically download models from HF Hub. To access gated models, you should provide a token source. They may be one of:
- `literal:&lt;value&gt;`: Load from a specified literal
- `env:&lt;value&gt;`: Load from a specified environment variable
- `path:&lt;value&gt;`: Load from a specified file
- `cache`: **default**: Load from the HF token at ~/.cache/huggingface/token or equivalent.
- `none`: Use no HF token

This is passed in the following ways:
- Command line:
```bash
./mistralrs-server --token-source none -i plain -m microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct -a phi3
```
- Python:

[Here](examples/python/token_source.py) is an example of setting the token source.

If token cannot be loaded, no token will be used (i.e. effectively using `none`).

### Loading models from local files:

You can also instruct mistral.rs to load models fully locally by modifying the `*_model_id` arguments or options:
```bash
./mistralrs-server --port 1234 plain -m . -a mistral
```

Throughout mistral.rs, any model ID argument or option may be a local path and should contain the following files for each model ID option:
- `--model-id` (server) or `model_id` (python/rust) or `--tok-model-id` (server) or `tok_model_id` (python/rust): 
  - `config.json`
  - `tokenizer_config.json`
  - `tokenizer.json` (if not specified separately)
  - `.safetensors`/`.bin`/`.pth`/`.pt` files (defaults to `.safetensors`)
  - `preprocessor_config.json` (required for vision models).
  - `processor_config.json` (optional for vision models).
- `--quantized-model-id` (server) or `quantized_model_id` (python/rust):
  - Specified `.gguf` or `.ggml` file.
- `--x-lora-model-id` (server) or `xlora_model_id` (python/rust):
  - `xlora_classifier.safetensors`
  - `xlora_config.json`
  - Adapters `.safetensors` and `adapter_config.json` files in their respective directories
- `--adapters-model-id` (server) or `adapters_model_id` (python/rust):
  - Adapters `.safetensors` and `adapter_config.json` files in their respective directories

### Running GGUF models

To run GGUF models, the only mandatory arguments are the quantized model ID and the quantized filename. The quantized model ID can be a HF model ID.

You must also specify either `-i` for interactive mode or `--port` to launch a server, just like when [running a non-GGUF model with the CLI](#run-with-the-cli)

GGUF models contain a tokenizer. However, mistral.rs allows you to run the model with a tokenizer from a specified model, typically the official one. This means there are two options:
1) [With a specified tokenizer](#with-a-specified-tokenizer)
1) [With the builtin tokenizer](#with-the-builtin-tokenizer)

#### With a specified tokenizer

Running with a tokenizer model ID enables you to specify the model ID to source the tokenizer from:

```bash
./mistralrs-server gguf -m bartowski/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-GGUF -f Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf -t microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct
```

If the specified tokenizer model ID contains a `tokenizer.json`, then it will be used over the GGUF tokenizer.

#### With the builtin tokenizer

Using the builtin tokenizer:

```bash
./mistralrs-server gguf -m bartowski/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-GGUF -f Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

(or using a local file):

```bash
./mistralrs-server gguf -m path/to/files -f Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

There are a few more ways to configure:

**Chat template:**

The chat template can be automatically detected and loaded from the GGUF file if no other chat template source is specified including the tokenizer model ID.

If that does not work, you can either [provide a tokenizer](#with-a-specified-tokenizer) (recommended), or specify a custom chat template.

```bash
./mistralrs-server --chat-template &lt;chat_template&gt; gguf -m . -f Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

**Tokenizer**

The following tokenizer model types are currently supported. If you would like one to be added, please raise an issue. Otherwise,
please consider using the method demonstrated in examples below, where the tokenizer is sourced from Hugging Face.

**Supported GGUF tokenizer types**
- `llama` (sentencepiece)
- `gpt2` (BPE)

## Run with the CLI

Mistral.rs uses subcommands to control the model type. Please run `./mistralrs-server --help` to see the subcommands which categorize the models by kind.

### Architecture for plain models

&gt; Note: for plain models, you can specify the data type to load and run in. This must be one of `f32`, `f16`, `bf16` or `auto` to choose based on the device. This is specified in the `--dype`/`-d` parameter after the model architecture (`plain`). For quantized models (gguf/ggml), you may specify data type of `f32` or `bf16` (`f16` is not recommended due to its lower precision in quantized inference).

If you do not specify the architecture, an attempt will be made to use the model&#039;s config. If this fails, please raise an issue.

- `mistral`
- `gemma`
- `mixtral`
- `llama`
- `phi2`
- `phi3`
- `phi3.5moe`
- `qwen2`
- `gemma2`
- `starcoder2`
- `deepseekv2`
- `deepseekv3`

### Architecture for vision models

&gt; Note: for vision models, you can specify the data type to load and run in. This must be one of `f32`, `f16`, `bf16` or `auto` to choose based on the device. This is specified in the `--dype`/`-d` parameter after the model architecture (`vision-plain`).

- `phi3v`
- `idefics2`
- `llava_next`
- `llava`
- `vllama`
- `qwen2vl`
- `idefics3`
- `minicpmo`
- `phi4mm`
- `qwen2_5vl`
- `gemma3`
- `mistral3`

### Supported GGUF architectures

**Plain:**

- `llama`
- `phi2`
- `phi3`
- `starcoder2`
- `qwen2`

**With adapters:**

- `llama`
- `phi3`

### Interactive mode

You can launch interactive mode, a simple chat application running in the terminal, by passing `-i`:

```bash
./mistralrs-server -i plain -m microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct -a phi3
```

Vision models work too:

```bash
./mistralrs-server -i vision-plain -m lamm-mit/Cephalo-Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-128k -a vllama
```

And even diffusion models:

```bash
./mistralrs-server -i diffusion-plain -m black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell -a flux
```

On Apple Silicon (`Metal`), run with throughput log, settings of paged attention (maximum usage of 4GB for kv cache) and dtype (bf16 for kv cache and attention)

```bash
cargo build --release --features metal
./target/release/mistralrs-server -i --throughput --paged-attn --pa-gpu-mem 4096 gguf --dtype bf16 -m /Users/Downloads/ -f Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

### OpenAI HTTP server

You can an HTTP server

```bash
./mistralrs-server --port 1234 plain -m microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct -a phi3.5moe
```

### Structured selection with a `.toml` file

We provide a method to select models with a `.toml` file. The keys are the same as the command line, with `no_kv_cache` and `tokenizer_json` being &quot;global&quot; keys.

Example:
```bash
./mistralrs-server --port 1234 toml -f toml-selectors/gguf.toml
```

# Time-aware multimodal data stack and visualizations
Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It&#039;s used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

Rerun is easy to use!
Use the Rerun SDK (available for C++, Python and Rust) to log data like images, tensors, point clouds, and text.
Logs are streamed to the Rerun Viewer for live visualization or to file for later use.
You can also query the logged data through [our dataframe API](https://rerun.io/docs/howto/dataframe-api).

[Get started](#getting-started) in minutes – no account needed.

* [Run the Rerun Viewer in your browser](https://www.rerun.io/viewer)
* [Read about what Rerun is and who it is for](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-rerun)

### A short taste
```py
import rerun as rr  # pip install rerun-sdk

rr.init(&quot;rerun_example_app&quot;)

rr.connect()  # Connect to a remote viewer
# rr.spawn()  # Spawn a child process with a viewer and connect
# rr.save(&quot;recording.rrd&quot;)  # Stream all logs to disk

# Associate subsequent data with 42 on the “frame” timeline
rr.set_time(&quot;frame&quot;, sequence=42)

# Log colored 3D points to the entity at `path/to/points`
rr.log(&quot;path/to/points&quot;, rr.Points3D(positions, colors=colors))
…
```

  &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Getting started
* [**C++**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/cpp)
* [**Python**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/python): `pip install rerun-sdk` or on [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/rerun-sdk-feedstock)
* [**Rust**](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/rust): `cargo add rerun`

### Installing the Rerun Viewer binary
To stream log data over the network or load our `.rrd` data files you also need the `rerun` binary.
It can be installed with `pip install rerun-sdk` or with `cargo install rerun-cli --locked --features nasm` (see note below).
Note that only the Python SDK comes bundled with the Viewer whereas C++ &amp; Rust always rely on a separate install.

**Note**: the `nasm` Cargo feature requires the [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us) CLI to be installed and available in your path.
Alternatively, you may skip enabling this feature, but this may result in inferior video decoding performance.

You should now be able to run `rerun --help` in any terminal.

## Status
We are in active development.
There are many features we want to add, and the API is still evolving.
_Expect breaking changes!_

Some shortcomings:
* [Multi-million point clouds are slow](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1136)
* [The viewer slows down when there are too many entities](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7115)
* The data you want to visualize must fit in RAM
  - See &lt;https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/limit-ram&gt; for how to bound memory use.
  - We plan on having a disk-based data store some time in the future.


## What is Rerun for?

Rerun is built to help you understand and improve complex processes that include rich multimodal data, like 2D, 3D, text, time series, tensors, etc.
It is used in many industries, including robotics, simulation, computer vision,
or anything that involves a lot of sensors or other signals that evolve over time.

### Example use case
Say you&#039;re building a vacuum cleaning robot and it keeps running into walls. Why is it doing that? You need some tool to debug it, but a normal debugger isn&#039;t gonna be helpful. Similarly, just logging text won&#039;t be very helpful either. The robot may log &quot;Going through doorway&quot; but that won&#039;t explain why it thinks the wall is a door.

What you need is a visual and temporal debugger, that can log all the different representations of the world the robots holds in its little head, such as:

* RGB camera feed
* depth images
* lidar scan
* segmentation image (how the robot interprets what it sees)
* its 3D map of the apartment
* all the objects the robot has detected (or thinks it has detected), as 3D shapes in the 3D map
* its confidence in its prediction
* etc

You also want to see how all these streams of data evolve over time so you can go back and pinpoint exactly what went wrong, when and why.

Maybe it turns out that a glare from the sun hit one of the sensors in the wrong way, confusing the segmentation network leading to bad object detection. Or maybe it was a bug in the lidar scanning code. Or maybe the robot thought it was somewhere else in the apartment, because its odometry was broken. Or it could be one of a thousand other things. Rerun will help you find out!

But seeing the world from the point of the view of the robot is not just for debugging - it will also give you ideas on how to improve the algorithms, new test cases to set up, or datasets to collect. It will also let you explain the brains of the robot to your colleagues, boss, and customers. And so on. Seeing is believing, and an image is worth a thousand words, and multimodal temporal logging is worth a thousand images :)

While seeing and understanding your data is core to making progress in robotics, there is one more thing:
You can also use the data you collected for visualization to create new datasets for training and evaluating the models and algorithms that run on your robot.
Rerun provides query APIs to make it easy to extract clean datasets from your recording for exactly that purpose.

Of course, Rerun is useful for much more than just robots. Any time you have any form of sensors, or 2D or 3D state evolving over time, Rerun is a great tool.


## Business model
Rerun uses an open-core model. Everything in this repository will stay open source and free (both as in beer and as in freedom).

We are also building a commercial data platform.
Right now that is only available for a few select design partners.
[Click here if you&#039;re interested](https://rerun.io/pricing).

The Rerun open source project targets the needs of individual developers.
The commercial product targets the needs specific to teams that build and run computer vision and robotics products.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;User:${INFO1[3]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;User:${INFO2[3]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# TODO(#1713): The syntax `User:$OWNER` for user accounts will change in the future.
```

# Fontations

This repo contains a number of foundational crates for reading and
manipulating OpenType font files. It is motivated by a desire to have more
robust and performant open tools for a variety of font engineering and
production tasks. For an overview of the motivations, see
[googlefonts/oxidize][oxidize].

## Structure

Currently, this repo contains four main library crates: [`font-types`][], [`read-fonts`][],
[`write-fonts`][], and [`skrifa`][]:

- [`font-types`][] contains common definitions of the core types used in the
  OpenType spec. This is a small crate, and is intended as a basic dependency
  for any project reading or manipulating font data.
- [`read-fonts`][] contains code for parsing and accessing font files. It is
  intended to be a high performance parser, suitable for shaping. In particular
  this means that it performs no allocation and no copying.
- [`write-fonts`][] contains code for modifying and writing font data. It contains
  owned types representing the various tables and records in the specification,
  as well as code for compiling these and writing out font files. It has an
  optional dependency on `read-fonts`, in which case it can also parse font
  data, which can then be modified and written back out to disk.
- [`skrifa`][] is a mid level library that provides access to various types of
  metadata contained in a font as well as support for loading glyph outlines.
    - It&#039;s primary purpose is to replace FreeType in Google applications.
    - It is also used for tasks such as produce assets for https://fonts.google.com/icons

## depgraph

Shows the non-dev dependency relationships among the font-related crates in fontations. fontc primarily uses the fontations crates via write-fonts and skrifa.

    write-fonts --&gt; kurbo
    norad --&gt; kurbo
```

## codegen

Much of the code in the `read-fonts` and `write-fonts` crate is generated
automatically. Code generation is performed by the `font-codegen` crate. For an
overview of what we generate and how it works, see the [codegen-tour][]. For an
overview of how to use the `font-codegen` crate, see the readme at
[`font-codegen/README.md`][codegen-readme].

## Fuzzing

* Coverage can be viewed at https://oss-fuzz.com/, and search for &quot;fontations&quot;
* The `fuzz/` crate in this repo contains our fuzzers
* fuzzers are implemented using the [`cargo-fuzz`](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html) crate
* [oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) configuration lives in https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/fontations
   * [build.sh](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/fontations/build.sh) looks for `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/fuzz_*`
   * ^ is meant to mean we can add additional fuzzers to fontations without having to touch oss-fuzz every time
   * `build.sh` also controls the test corpus, look for the `git clone` lines
 
To reproduce a fuzzer issue:

1. Download the file from the testcase, e.g. https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase-detail/6213391169945600
1. Build the fuzzers
   * `cargo +nightly  fuzz build -O --debug-assertions`
1. Pass the repro file to the fuzzer
   * `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/fuzz_skrifa_outline ~/Downloads/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-fuzz_skrifa_outline-6213391169945600`

## Performance

### Harfbuzz

https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/perf/README.md has instructions on
running harfbuzz benchmarks, including against Fontations.

## Contributing

We have included a few git hooks that you may choose to use to ensure that
patches will pass CI; these are in `resources/githooks`.

If you would like to have these run automatically when you commit or push
changes, you can set this as your git hooksPath:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath &quot;./resources/githooks&quot;
```

**note**: If you wish to use the hooks on macOS, install the gnu coreutils
(`brew install coreutils`, via homebrew.)

## Releasing

We use [`cargo-release`] to help guide the release process. It can be installed
with `cargo install cargo-release`. You may need to install `pkg-config` via your
package manager for this to work.

Releasing involves the following steps:

1. Determine which crates may need to be published: run `cargo release changes`
   to see which crates have been modified since their last release.
1. Determine the new versions for the crates.
   * Before 1.0, breaking changes bump the *minor* version number, and non-breaking changes modify the *patch* number.
1. Update manifest versions and release. `./resources/scripts/bump-version.sh` orchestrates this process.
   * `cargo release` does all the heavy lifting

   ```shell
   # To see usage
   ./resources/scripts/bump-version.sh
   # To do the thing
   ./resources/scripts/bump-version.sh read-fonts write-fonts patch
   ```

1. Commit these changes to a new branch, get it approved and merged, and switch
   to the up-to-date `main`.
1. Publish the crates. `./resources/scripts/release.sh` orchestrates the process.
   * You will be prompted to review changes along the way

   ```shell
   # To see usage
   ./resources/scripts/release.sh
   # To do the thing
   ./resources/scripts/release.sh read-fonts write-fonts
   ```

## Skia and Chromium builds

An experimental `SkTypeface` implementation based on Fontations exists. This
build is available in the Skia and Chromium repositories. The goal is to
eventually use Fontations + Skia in Chromium as a memory-safe font
backend. Tracking bugs: [Skia](https://crbug.com/skia/14259),
[Chromium](https://crbug.com/1446251). To build the backends in Skia or Chromium
follow the instructions below. This process is currently only tested on Linux.

### Skia build

1. Download Skia https://skia.org/docs/user/download/, including bazelisk
1. `$ bazelisk build --sandbox_base=/dev/shm --with_fontations //tools/viewer
   //tests:FontationsTest` (to build debug, add `-c dbg` after `build`)
   * You should now have executables at `bazel-bin/tests/FontationsTest` and `bazel-bin/tools/viewer/viewer`

#### Skia Fontations unit tests

Build as above, then run the executable to run tests:

`$ bazel-bin/tests/FontationsTest`

OR compile and test in one command:

`$ bazelisk  test --sandbox_base=/dev/shm --with_fontations //tests:FontationsTest`

#### Skia Fontations GM

Build as above then:

`$ bazel-bin/tools/viewer/viewer --slide GM_typeface_fontations_roboto`

OR build and run in one command:

`$ bazelisk run --sandbox_base=/dev/shm --with_fontations //tools/viewer -- --slide GM_typeface_fontations_roboto`

### chromium build

1. Follow the instructions for [getting and building
   Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/linux/build_instructions.md)
1. Add `use_typeface_fontations = true` to your `args.gn` using `$ gn args
   out/&lt;builddir&gt;`
1. Build Chromium using `autoninja -C out/&lt;builddir&gt; chrome`
1. Run Chromium using `$ out/&lt;builddir&gt;/chrome`
1. Go to chrome://flags/#enable-fontations-backend and activate the flag, restart Chrome.
1. Navigate to any URL, observe web fonts being displayed with Fontations + Skia path rendering.

Slint is a declarative GUI toolkit to build native user interfaces for embedded,
desktop, and mobile applications written in Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Python.

The name *Slint* is derived from our design goals:

- **Scalable**: Slint should support responsive UI design, allow cross-platform
    usage across operating systems and processor architectures and support
    multiple programming languages.
- **Lightweight**: Slint should require minimal resources, in terms of memory
    and processing power, and yet deliver a smooth, smartphone-like user
    experience on any device.
- **Intuitive**: Designers and developers should feel productive while enjoying
    the GUI design and development process. The design creation tools should be
    intuitive to use for the designers. Similarly for the developers, the APIs
    should be consistent and easy to use, no matter which programming language
    they choose.
- **Native**: GUI built with Slint should match the end users&#039; expectations of a
    native application irrespective of the platform - desktop, mobile, web or
    embedded system. The UI design should be compiled to machine code and provide
    flexibility that only a native application can offer: Access full operating
    system APIs, utilize all CPU and GPU cores, connect to any peripheral.

## Current Status

Slint is in active development. The state of support for each platform is as
follows:

- **Embedded**: *Ready*. Slint is being used by customers in production on embedded
    devices running embedded Linux and Windows. The Slint run-time requires less than
    300KiB of RAM and can run on different processor architectures such as ARM Cortex M,
    ESP32, STM32 from the MCU category to ARM Cortex A, Intel x86 from the MPU category.
- **Desktop**: *In Progress*. While Slint is a good fit on Windows, Linux and Mac,
    we are working on improving the platform support in subsequent releases.
- **Web**: *In Progress*. Slint apps can be compiled to WebAssembly and can run
    in a web browser. As there are many other web frameworks, the web platform
    is not one of our primary target platforms. The web support is currently
    limited to demo purposes.
- **Mobile**
  - Android: *In Progress*. Track the progress of work here https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/46.
  - iOS: *Todo*. Support for iOS will commence after the initial support for Android is completed.

### Accessibility

Slint supports keyboard based navigation of many widgets, and user interfaces
are scalable. The basic infrastructure for assistive technology like screen
readers is in place. We&#039;re aware that more work is needed to get best-of-class
support for users with special needs.

## Get Started

### Hello World

The UI is defined in a Domain Specific Language that is declarative, easy to use,
intuitive, and provides a powerful way to describe graphical elements, their
placement, their hierarchy, property bindings, and the flow of data through the
different states.

Here&#039;s the obligatory &quot;Hello World&quot;:

```slint
export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

### Documentation

For more details, check out the [Slint Language Documentation](https://slint.dev/docs/slint).

The [examples](examples) folder contains examples and demos, showing how to
use the Slint markup language and how to interact with a Slint user interface
from supported programming languages.

The `docs` folder contains a lot more information, including
[build instructions](docs/building.md), and
[internal developer docs](docs/development.md).

Refer to the README of each language directory in the `api` folder:

- [C++](api/cpp) ([Documentation][#15] | [Getting Started Template][#17])
- [Rust](api/rs/slint) [![Crates.io][#18]][#19] ([Documentation][#20] | [Tutorial Video][#22] | [Getting Started Template][#23])
- [JavaScript/NodeJS (Beta)](api/node) [![npm][#24]][#25] ([Documentation][#26] | [Getting Started Template][#28])

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or
JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which is compiled to
native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint.dev/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint`
are pure functions that the compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler
could choose to &quot;inline&quot; properties and remove those that are constant or
unchanged. In the future we hope to improve rendering time on low end devices by
pre-processing images and text. The compiler could determine that a `Text` or an
`Image` element is always on top of another `Image` in the same location.
Consequently both elements could be rendered ahead of time into a single
element, thus cutting down on rendering time.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization,
and finally code generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation
in the target language. The C++ code generator produces a C++ header file, the
Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter for dynamic
languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in
the `.slint` language. Components with their elements, items, and properties are
laid out in a single memory region, to reduce memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time:

- The `femtovg` renderer uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
- The `skia` renderer uses [Skia](https://skia.org) for rendering.
- The `software` renderer uses the CPU with no additional dependencies.

NOTE: When Qt is installed on the system, the `qt` style becomes available,
using Qt&#039;s QStyle to achieve native looking widgets.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:

- A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live
  preview of the .slint files to many editors.
- It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode)
  available from the market place.
- A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The
  `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview your UI while you are
  working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
- [**SlintPad**](https://slintpad.com/), an online editor to try out .slint syntax
  without installing anything ([sources](./tools/slintpad)).
- An [**updater**](./tools/updater) to convert the .slint files from
  previous versions to newer versions.
- A [**Figma to Slint**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint) plugin.

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to
configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.

Feldera has the &lt;a href=&quot;#-theory&quot;&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; ability to &lt;b&gt;evaluate arbitrary SQL programs incrementally&lt;/b&gt;, making it more powerful, expressive and performant than existing alternatives like batch engines, warehouses, stream processors or streaming databases.
&lt;/p&gt;

## 🔥 Incremental Computation Engine

Our approach to incremental computation is simple. A Feldera `pipeline` is a set of SQL tables and views. Views can be
deeply nested.
Users start, stop or pause pipelines to manage and advance a computation.
Pipelines continuously process
**changes**, which are any number of inserts, updates or deletes to a set of tables. When the pipeline receives changes,
Feldera **incrementally** updates all the views by only looking at the changes and it completely avoids recomputing over
older data.
While a pipeline is running, users can inspect the results of the views at any time.

Our approach to incremental computation makes Feldera incredibly fast (millions of events per second on a laptop).
It also enables **unified offline and online compute** over both live and historical data. Feldera users have built batch
and real-time
feature engineering pipelines, ETL pipelines, various forms of incremental and periodic analytical jobs over batch data,
and more.

## 🎯 Our defining Features

1. **Full SQL support and more.**  Our engine is the only one in existence that can evaluate full SQL
   syntax and semantics completely incrementally. This includes joins and aggregates, group by, correlated subqueries,
   window functions, complex data types, time series operators, UDFs, and
   recursive queries. Pipelines can process deeply nested hierarchies of views.

2. **Fast out-of-the-box performance.**  Feldera users have reported getting complex use cases
   implemented in 30 minutes or less, and hitting millions
   of events per second in performance on a laptop without any tuning.

3. **Datasets larger than RAM.** Feldera is designed to handle datasets
   that exceed the available RAM by spilling efficiently to disk, taking advantage of recent advances in NVMe storage.

4. **Strong guarantees on consistency and freshness.** Feldera is strongly consistent. It
   also [guarantees](https://www.feldera.com/blog/synchronous-streaming/) that the state of the views always corresponds
   to what you&#039;d get if you ran the queries in a batch system for the same input.

5. **Connectors for your favorite data sources and destinations.** Feldera connects to myriad batch and streaming data
   sources, like Kafka, HTTP, CDC streams, S3, Data Lakes, Warehouses and more.
   If you need a connector that we don&#039;t yet support, [let us know](https://github.com/feldera/feldera/issues).

6. **Fault tolerance**. Feldera can gracefully restart from the exact
   point of an abrupt shutdown or crash, picking up from where it left
   off without dropping or duplicating input or output. Fault
   tolerance is a preview feature that requires support from input and
   output connectors.

7. **Seamless ad-hoc queries**. You can run ad-hoc SQL queries on a running or paused pipeline to inspect or debug the
   state of materialized views. While these queries are evaluated in batch mode using Apache Datafusion, their
   results are consistent with the incremental engine&#039;s output for the same queries, aside from minor dialect and
   rounding differences.

## 💻 Architecture

The following diagram shows Feldera&#039;s architecture

![Feldera Platform Architecture](architecture.svg)

## ⚡️ Quick start with Docker

First, make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) installed. Then run the
following command:

```text
docker run -p 8080:8080 --tty --rm -it ghcr.io/feldera/pipeline-manager:latest
```

Once the container image downloads and you see the Feldera logo on your terminal, visit
the WebConsole at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
We suggest going through our [tutorial](https://docs.feldera.com/tutorials/basics/) next.

We also have instructions to run Feldera using [Docker Compose](https://docs.feldera.com/get-started),
if you&#039;d like to experiment with Kafka and other auxiliary services.

## ⚙️ Running Feldera from sources

To run Feldera from sources, first install required dependencies:

- [Rust tool chain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- cmake
- libssl-dev
- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 19 or newer
- maven
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

After that, the first step is to build the SQL compiler:

```
cd sql-to-dbsp-compiler
./build.sh
```

Next, from the repository root, run the pipeline-manager:

```
cargo run --bin=pipeline-manager --features pg-embed
```

As with the Docker instructions above, you can now visit
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) on your browser to see the
Feldera WebConsole.

## 🎓 Theory

Feldera Platform achieves its objectives by building on a solid mathematical
foundation. The formal model that underpins our system, called DBSP, is
described in the accompanying paper:

- [Budiu, Chajed, McSherry, Ryzhyk, Tannen. DBSP: Automatic
  Incremental View Maintenance for Rich Query Languages, Conference on
  Very Large Databases, August 2023, Vancouver,
  Canada](https://docs.feldera.com/vldb23.pdf)

- Here is [a presentation about DBSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT4k5DCnvPU) at the 2023
  Apache Calcite Meetup.

The model provides two things:

1. **Semantics.** DBSP defines a formal language of streaming operators and
   queries built out of these operators, and precisely specifies how these queries
   must transform input streams to output streams.

1. **Algorithm.** DBSP also gives an algorithm that takes an arbitrary query and
   generates an incremental dataflow program that implements this query correctly (in accordance
   with its formal semantics) and efficiently. Efficiency here means, in a
   nutshell, that the cost of processing a set of input events is proportional to
   the size of the input rather than the entire state of the database.

&lt;/p&gt;

- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.13 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/) for
    [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.11.2
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`)  codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code
quality tools, including:

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

***If you&#039;ll click on the image, you&#039;ll be led to an SVG version of it on the website where you can directly click on every issue***

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Pingora

![Pingora banner image](./docs/assets/pingora_banner.png)

## What is Pingora
Pingora is a Rust framework to [build fast, reliable and programmable networked systems](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source).

Pingora is battle tested as it has been serving more than 40 million Internet requests per second for [more than a few years](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet).

## Feature highlights
* Async Rust: fast and reliable
* HTTP 1/2 end to end proxy
* TLS over OpenSSL, BoringSSL or rustls(experimental).
* gRPC and websocket proxying
* Graceful reload
* Customizable load balancing and failover strategies
* Support for a variety of observability tools

## Reasons to use Pingora
* **Security** is your top priority: Pingora is a more memory safe alternative for services that are written in C/C++
* Your service is **performance-sensitive**: Pingora is fast and efficient
* Your service requires extensive **customization**: The APIs Pingora proxy framework provides are highly programmable

# Getting started

See our [quick starting guide](./docs/quick_start.md) to see how easy it is to build a load balancer.

Our [user guide](./docs/user_guide/index.md) covers more topics such as how to configure and run Pingora servers, as well as how to build custom HTTP servers and proxy logic on top of Pingora&#039;s framework.

API docs are also available for all the crates.

# Notable crates in this workspace
* Pingora: the &quot;public facing&quot; crate to build networked systems and proxies
* Pingora-core: this crate defines the protocols, functionalities and basic traits
* Pingora-proxy: the logic and APIs to build HTTP proxies
* Pingora-error: the common error type used across Pingora crates
* Pingora-http: the HTTP header definitions and APIs
* Pingora-openssl &amp; pingora-boringssl: SSL related extensions and APIs
* Pingora-ketama: the [Ketama](https://github.com/RJ/ketama) consistent algorithm
* Pingora-limits: efficient counting algorithms
* Pingora-load-balancing: load balancing algorithm extensions for pingora-proxy
* Pingora-memory-cache: Async in-memory caching with cache lock to prevent cache stampede
* Pingora-timeout: A more efficient async timer system
* TinyUfo: The caching algorithm behind pingora-memory-cache

# System requirements

## Systems
Linux is our tier 1 environment and main focus.

We will try our best for most code to compile for Unix environments. This is for developers and users to have an easier time developing with Pingora in Unix-like environments like macOS (though some features might be missing)

Windows support is preliminary by community&#039;s best effort only.

Both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures will be supported.

## Rust version

Pingora keeps a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) policy of 6 months. This means we will accept PRs that upgrade the MSRV as long as the new Rust version used is at least 6 months old.

Our current MSRV is 1.72.

Building with the optional feature `boringssl` with Boring &gt;= 4.14 requires Rust 1.80.

## Build Requirements

Some of the crates in this repository have dependencies on additional tools and
libraries that must be satisfied in order to build them:

* Make sure that [Clang] is installed on your system (for boringssl)
* Make sure that [Perl 5] is installed on your system (for openssl)

[Clang]:https://clang.llvm.org/
[Perl 5]:https://www.perl.org/

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Platform support

See uv&#039;s [platform support](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/platforms/) document.

## Versioning policy

See uv&#039;s [versioning policy](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/versioning/) document.

## Contributing

[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its

This repository is the central place for Rust development of the [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) spec.

## Getting started

- **Main documentation** can be found on https://docs.rs/libp2p.

- The **[examples](examples)** folder contains small binaries showcasing the
  many protocols in this repository.

- For **security related issues** please [file a private security vulnerability
  report](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/security/advisories/new) . Please do not file a
  public issue on GitHub.

- To **report bugs, suggest improvements or request new features** please open a
  GitHub issue on this repository.

- For **rust-libp2p specific questions** please use the GitHub _Discussions_
  forum https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions.

- For **discussions and questions related to multiple libp2p implementations**
  please use the libp2p _Discourse_ forum https://discuss.libp2p.io.

- For synchronous discussions join the [open rust-libp2p maintainer
  calls](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions?discussions_q=open+maintainers+call+)
  or the [biweekly libp2p community calls](https://discuss.libp2p.io/t/libp2p-community-calls/1157).

## Repository Structure

The main components of this repository are structured as follows:

  * `core/`: The implementation of `libp2p-core` with its `Transport` and
    `StreamMuxer` API on which almost all other crates depend.

  * `transports/`: Implementations of transport protocols (e.g. TCP) and protocol upgrades
    (e.g. for authenticated encryption, compression, ...) based on the `libp2p-core` `Transport`
    API.

  * `muxers/`: Implementations of the `StreamMuxer` interface of `libp2p-core`,
    e.g. (sub)stream multiplexing protocols on top of (typically TCP) connections.
    Multiplexing protocols are (mandatory) `Transport` upgrades.

  * `swarm/`: The implementation of `libp2p-swarm` building on `libp2p-core`
    with the central interfaces `NetworkBehaviour` and `ConnectionHandler` used
    to implement application protocols (see `protocols/`).

  * `protocols/`: Implementations of application protocols based on the
    `libp2p-swarm` APIs.

  * `misc/`: Utility libraries.

  * `libp2p/examples/`: Worked examples of built-in application protocols (see `protocols/`)
    with common `Transport` configurations.

## Community Guidelines

The libp2p project operates under the [IPFS Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

&gt; tl;dr
&gt;
&gt; - Be respectful.
&gt; - We&#039;re here to help: abuse@ipfs.io
&gt; - Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
&gt; - Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the
&gt;   IPFS [and libp2p] community.
&gt; - &quot;Too long, didn&#039;t read&quot; is not a valid excuse for not knowing what is in
&gt;   this document.
