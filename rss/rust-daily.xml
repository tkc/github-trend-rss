Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. It’s based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways you can contribute to Zed.

Also... we&#039;re hiring! Check out our [jobs](https://zed.dev/jobs) page for open roles.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

# Rustlings 🦀❤️

&lt;/div&gt;

Greetings and welcome to Rustlings.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

It is recommended to do the Rustlings exercises in parallel to reading [the official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust 📚️

[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is another recommended resource that you might find helpful.
It contains code examples and exercises similar to Rustlings, but online.

## Getting Started

### Installing Rust

Before installing Rustlings, you need to have the **latest version of Rust** installed.
Visit [www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for further instructions on installing Rust.
This will also install _Cargo_, Rust&#039;s package/project manager.

&gt; 🐧 If you are on Linux, make sure you have installed `gcc` (for a linker).
&gt;
&gt; Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`
&gt;
&gt; Dnf: `sudo dnf install gcc`

&gt; 🍎 If you are on MacOS, make sure you have installed Xcode and its developer tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

### Installing Rustlings

The following command will download and compile Rustlings:

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the installation fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

- Make sure you have the latest Rust version by running `rustup update`
- Try adding the `--locked` flag: `cargo install rustlings --locked`
- Otherwise, please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new)

&lt;/details&gt;

### Initialization

After installing Rustlings, run the following command to initialize the `rustlings/` directory:

```bash
rustlings init
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the command &lt;code&gt;rustlings&lt;/code&gt; can&#039;t be found…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

You are probably using Linux and installed Rust using your package manager.

Cargo installs binaries to the directory `~/.cargo/bin`.
Sadly, package managers often don&#039;t add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.

The solution is to …

- either add `~/.cargo/bin` manually to `PATH`
- or to uninstall Rust from the package manager and install it using the official way with `rustup`: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

&lt;/details&gt;

Now, go into the newly initialized directory and launch Rustlings for further instructions on getting started with the exercises:

```bash
cd rustlings/
rustlings
```

## Working environment

### Editor

Our general recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [rust-analyzer plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
But any editor that supports [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) should be enough for working on the exercises.

### Terminal

While working with Rustlings, please use a modern terminal for the best user experience.
The default terminal on Linux and Mac should be sufficient.
On Windows, we recommend the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal).

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `exercises/&lt;topic&gt;`.
For every topic, there is an additional `README.md` file with some resources to get you started on the topic.
We highly recommend that you have a look at them before you start 📚️

Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it&#039;s up to you to fix it!
Some exercises contain tests that need to pass for the exercise to be done ✅

Search for `TODO` and `todo!()` to find out what you need to change.
Ask for hints by entering `h` in the _watch mode_ 💡

### Watch Mode

After the [initialization](#initialization), Rustlings can be launched by simply running the command `rustlings`.

This will start the _watch mode_ which walks you through the exercises in a predefined order (what we think is best for newcomers).
It will rerun the current exercise automatically every time you change the exercise&#039;s file in the `exercises/` directory.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If detecting file changes in the &lt;code&gt;exercises/&lt;/code&gt; directory fails…&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;click to expand&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; You can add the **`--manual-run`** flag (`rustlings --manual-run`) to manually rerun the current exercise by entering `r` in the watch mode.
&gt;
&gt; Please [report the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/issues/new) with some information about your operating system and whether you run Rustlings in a container or virtual machine (e.g. WSL).

&lt;/details&gt;

### Exercise List

In the [watch mode](#watch-mode) (after launching `rustlings`), you can enter `l` to open the interactive exercise list.

The list allows you to…

- See the status of all exercises (done or pending)
- `c`: Continue at another exercise (temporarily skip some exercises or go back to a previous one)
- `r`: Reset status and file of the selected exercise (you need to _reload/reopen_ its file in your editor afterwards)

See the footer of the list for all possible keys.

## Questions?

If you need any help while doing the exercises and the builtin-hints aren&#039;t helpful, feel free to ask in the [_Q&amp;A_ category of the discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=) if your question wasn&#039;t asked yet 💡

## Third-Party Exercises

Third-party exercises are a set of exercises maintained by the community.
You can use the same `rustlings` program that you installed with `cargo install rustlings` to run them:

- 🇯🇵 [Japanese Rustlings](https://github.com/sotanengel/rustlings-jp)：A Japanese translation of the Rustlings exercises.
- 🇨🇳 [Simplified Chinese Rustlings](https://github.com/SandmeyerX/rustlings-zh-cn): A simplified Chinese translation of the Rustlings exercises.

Do you want to create your own set of Rustlings exercises to focus on some specific topic?
Or do you want to translate the original Rustlings exercises?
Then follow the the guide about [third-party exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_EXERCISES.md)!

## Continuing On

Once you&#039;ve completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use!
Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.

## Uninstalling Rustlings

If you want to remove Rustlings from your system, run the following command:

```bash
cargo uninstall rustlings
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Rust Programming Language

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version &lt;version_num&gt;
```

The book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you
do not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not
look right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,
you should run:

```bash
$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_

```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Firefox&quot; book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;firefox.exe&quot; .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_

```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;chrome.exe&quot; .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cd packages/trpl
$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps
```

## Contributing

We&#039;d love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the
kinds of contributions we&#039;re looking for.

[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want
to keep the online version of the book close to the print version when
possible, it may take longer than you&#039;re used to for us to address your issue
or pull request.

So far, we&#039;ve been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger
revisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request
isn&#039;t strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we&#039;re
working on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you
for your patience!

### Translations

We&#039;d love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We&#039;re waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations
[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false
positive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),
you need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for
consistency).

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/getzola/zola/total)

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

To find out more see the [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), look
in the [docs/content](docs/content) folder of this repository or visit the [Zola community forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and its template engine [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.

## Project status

Ruffle supports ActionScript 1, 2 and 3 pretty well, but it&#039;s still not finished by any means. Please report any issues in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues).

## Using Ruffle

The easiest way to try out Ruffle is to visit the [web demo page](https://ruffle.rs/demo/), then click the &quot;Select File&quot; button to load a SWF file of your choice.

[Nightly builds](https://ruffle.rs/downloads#nightly-releases) of Ruffle are available for desktop and web platforms.

For more detailed instructions, see our [wiki page](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle).

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

* Latest stable channel of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Java, available on your PATH as `java` (required for building the library containing the builtin Flash classes for ActionScript 3)

### Linux prerequisites

The following are typical dependencies for Linux:

* libasound2-dev
* libxcb-shape0-dev
* libxcb-xfixes0-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* libudev-dev
* libxcb-xinput-dev
* libxcb-xkb-dev
* libxcb-cursor-dev
* default-jre-headless
* cmake
* g++

### Desktop

#### Build

Use the following command to build and run the desktop app:

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_desktop`

To run a specific SWF file, pass the SWF path as an argument:

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_desktop -- test.swf`

To build in debug mode, simply omit `--release` from the command.

#### macOS

Ruffle desktop can be built from our [Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/homebrew-ruffle/):

`brew install --HEAD ruffle-rs/ruffle/ruffle`

_Note: because it is HEAD-only, you&#039;ll need to run `brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD ruffle` each time you want to update._

### Web or Extension

Follow [the instructions in the web directory](web/README.md#building-from-source) for building
either the web or browser extension version of Ruffle.

This project is tested with BrowserStack.

### Android

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle-android/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source) in the `ruffle-android` project for building the Android application of Ruffle.

### Scanner

If you have a collection of &quot;real world&quot; SWFs to test against, the scanner may be used to benchmark
ruffle&#039;s parsing capabilities. Provided with a folder and an output filename, it will attempt to read
all of the Flash files and report on the success of such a task.

`cargo run --release --package=ruffle_scanner -- scan folder/with/swfs/ results.csv`

### Exporter

If you have a SWF file and would like to capture an image of it, you may use the exporter tool.
This currently requires hardware acceleration, but can be run headless (with no window).

- `cargo run --release --package=exporter -- path/to/file.swf`
- `cargo run --release --package=exporter -- path/to/file.swf path/to/screenshots --frames 5`

## Structure

- `core` - core emulator and common code
- `swf` - SWF and ActionScript parser
- `desktop` - desktop client (uses `wgpu-rs`)
- `web` - web client and browser extension (uses `wasm-bindgen`)
- `render` - various rendering backends for both desktop and web
- `video` - video decoding backends
- `flv` - Flash Video decoder
- `wstr` - a Flash-compatible implementation of strings
- `scanner` - a utility to bulk parse SWF files
- `exporter` - a utility to generate PNG screenshots of a SWF file

## Sponsors

You can support the development of Ruffle via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ruffle-rs). Your sponsorship will help to ensure the accessibility of Flash content for the future. Thank you!

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).

Shell (Mac, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (Mac):

```sh
brew install deno
```

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```powershell
choco install deno
```

[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/DenoLand.Deno) (Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=DenoLand.Deno
```

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found in the manual
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/contributing/building_from_source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This should start a local web server on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Learn more about writing and running Deno programs
[in the docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Bitte AI Agent NextJS Template

This template provides a starting point for creating AI agents using the Bitte Protocol with Next.js. It includes pre-configured endpoints and tools that demonstrate common agent functionalities.

## Features

- 🤖 Pre-configured AI agent setup
- 🛠️ Built-in tools and endpoints:
  - Blockchain information retrieval
  - NEAR transaction generation
  - Reddit frontpage fetching
  - Twitter share intent generation
  - Coin flip functionality
- ⚡ Next.js 14 with App Router
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS for styling
- 📝 TypeScript support
- 🔄 Hot reload development environment

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will:
- Start your Next.js application
- Launch make-agent 
- Prompt you to sign a message in Bitte wallet to create an API key
- Launch your agent in the Bitte playground
- Allow you to freely edit and develop your code in the playground environment


## Available Tools

The template includes several pre-built tools:

### 1. Blockchain Information
- Endpoint: `/api/tools/get-blockchains`
- Returns a randomized list of blockchain networks

### 2. NEAR Transaction Generator
- Endpoint: `/api/tools/create-near-transaction`
- Creates NEAR transaction payloads for token transfers

### 3. EVM Transaction Generator
- Endpoint: `/api/tools/create-evm-transaction`
- Creates EVM transaction payloads for native eth transfers

### 4. Twitter Share
- Endpoint: `/api/tools/twitter`
- Generates Twitter share intent URLs

### 5. Coin Flip
- Endpoint: `/api/tools/coinflip`
- Simple random coin flip generator

## AI Agent Configuration

The template includes a pre-configured AI agent manifest at `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json`. You can customize the agent&#039;s behavior by modifying the configuration in `/api/ai-plugins/route.ts`. This route generates and returns the manifest object.


## Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Deploy to Vercel or your preferred hosting platform
3. Add your `BITTE_KEY` to the environment variables
4. The `make-agent deploy` command will automatically run during build

## Making your own agent

Whether you want to add a tool to this boilerplate or make your own standalone agent tool, here&#039;s you&#039;ll need:

1. Make sure [`make-agent`](https://github.com/BitteProtocol/make-agent) is installed in your project:
```bash
pnpm install --dev make-agent
```
2. Set up a manifest following the OpenAPI specification that describes your agent and its paths.
3. Have an api endpoint with the path `GET /api/ai-plugin` that returns your manifest

## Setting up the manifest

Follow the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-1) to add the following fields in the manifest object:
- `openapi`: The OpenAPI specification version that your manifest is following. Usually this is the latest version.
- `info`: Object containing information about the agent, namely its &#039;title&#039;, &#039;description&#039; and &#039;version&#039;.
- `servers`: Array of objects containing the urls for the deployed instances of the agent.
- `paths`: Object containing all your agent&#039;s paths and their operations.
- `&quot;x-mb&quot;`: Our custom field, containing the account id of the owner and an &#039;assistant&#039; object with the agent&#039;s metadata, namely the tools it uses, and additional instructions to guide it.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

## About

* **[Features](https://bevyengine.org):** A quick overview of Bevy&#039;s features.
* **[News](https://bevyengine.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

## Thanks

Bevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.

A huge thanks to Bevy&#039;s [generous sponsors](https://bevyengine.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn&#039;t free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) if you like what we&#039;re building.

&lt;!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is. It is required for BrowserStack sponsorship. --&gt;
This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## License

Bevy is free, open source and permissively licensed!
Except where noted (below and/or in individual files), all code in this repository is dual-licensed under either:

* MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

### Your contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise,
any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you,
as defined in the Apache-2.0 license,
shall be dual licensed as above,
without any additional terms or conditions.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust project’s dependencies and compiles your project.

**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].

**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].

[The Cargo Book]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
[Cargo Contributor Guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/

&gt; The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo
&gt; team for use by the wider ecosystem.
&gt; For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained
&gt; by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external
&gt; use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to
&gt; its APIs.

## Code Status

[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Code documentation: &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/&gt;

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `cargo` and `rustc`
* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
* `git` (to clone this repository)

**Other requirements:**

The following are optional based on your platform and needs.

* `pkg-config` — This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.
* OpenSSL — Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.

  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.

  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.
  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.

  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.

  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.

  LibreSSL is also supported.

**Optional system libraries:**

The build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:

* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) — Used for network transfers.
* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) — Used for fetching git dependencies.
* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) — Used for SSH access to git repositories.
* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (aka zlib) — Used for data compression.

It is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.

### Compiling

First, you&#039;ll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.

[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands


## Releases

Cargo releases coincide with Rust releases.
High level release notes are available as part of [Rust&#039;s release notes][rel].

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Learn Rust, one exercise at a time

You&#039;ve heard about Rust, but you never had the chance to try it out?\
This course is for you!

You&#039;ll learn Rust by solving 100 exercises.\
You&#039;ll go from knowing nothing about Rust to being able to start
writing your own programs, one exercise at a time.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This course has been written by [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/).\
&gt; It&#039;s one of the trainings in [our portfolio of Rust workshops](https://mainmatter.com/services/workshops/rust/).\
&gt; Check out our [landing page](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/) if you&#039;re looking for Rust consulting or
&gt; training!

## Getting started

Go to [rust-exercises.com](https://rust-exercises.com) and follow the instructions there
to get started with the course.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how
  you installed Rust on your system)
  to make sure you&#039;re running on the latest stable version.
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
  - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
    the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

**Serde is a framework for *ser*ializing and *de*serializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically.**

---

```toml
[dependencies]
serde_json = &quot;1.0&quot;
```

You may be looking for:

- [JSON API documentation](https://docs.rs/serde_json)
- [Serde API documentation](https://docs.rs/serde)
- [Detailed documentation about Serde](https://serde.rs/)
- [Setting up `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`](https://serde.rs/derive.html)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/serde-rs/json/releases)

JSON is a ubiquitous open-standard format that uses human-readable text to
transmit data objects consisting of key-value pairs.

```json
{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    &quot;age&quot;: 43,
    &quot;address&quot;: {
        &quot;street&quot;: &quot;10 Downing Street&quot;,
        &quot;city&quot;: &quot;London&quot;
    },
    &quot;phones&quot;: [
        &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
        &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
    ]
}
```

There are three common ways that you might find yourself needing to work with
JSON data in Rust.

 - **As text data.** An unprocessed string of JSON data that you receive on an
   HTTP endpoint, read from a file, or prepare to send to a remote server.
 - **As an untyped or loosely typed representation.** Maybe you want to check
   that some JSON data is valid before passing it on, but without knowing the
   structure of what it contains. Or you want to do very basic manipulations
   like insert a key in a particular spot.
 - **As a strongly typed Rust data structure.** When you expect all or most of
   your data to conform to a particular structure and want to get real work done
   without JSON&#039;s loosey-goosey nature tripping you up.

Serde JSON provides efficient, flexible, safe ways of converting data between
each of these representations.

## Operating on untyped JSON values

Any valid JSON data can be manipulated in the following recursive enum
representation. This data structure is [`serde_json::Value`][value].

```rust
enum Value {
    Null,
    Bool(bool),
    Number(Number),
    String(String),
    Array(Vec&lt;Value&gt;),
    Object(Map&lt;String, Value&gt;),
}
```

A string of JSON data can be parsed into a `serde_json::Value` by the
[`serde_json::from_str`][from_str] function. There is also
[`from_slice`][from_slice] for parsing from a byte slice `&amp;[u8]` and
[`from_reader`][from_reader] for parsing from any `io::Read` like a File or a
TCP stream.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=d69d8e3156d4bb81c4461b60b772ab72&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde_json::{Result, Value};

fn untyped_example() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Some JSON input data as a &amp;str. Maybe this comes from the user.
    let data = r#&quot;
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
            &quot;age&quot;: 43,
            &quot;phones&quot;: [
                &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
                &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
            ]
        }&quot;#;

    // Parse the string of data into serde_json::Value.
    let v: Value = serde_json::from_str(data)?;

    // Access parts of the data by indexing with square brackets.
    println!(&quot;Please call {} at the number {}&quot;, v[&quot;name&quot;], v[&quot;phones&quot;][0]);

    Ok(())
}
```

The result of square bracket indexing like `v[&quot;name&quot;]` is a borrow of the data
at that index, so the type is `&amp;Value`. A JSON map can be indexed with string
keys, while a JSON array can be indexed with integer keys. If the type of the
data is not right for the type with which it is being indexed, or if a map does
not contain the key being indexed, or if the index into a vector is out of
bounds, the returned element is `Value::Null`.

When a `Value` is printed, it is printed as a JSON string. So in the code above,
the output looks like `Please call &quot;John Doe&quot; at the number &quot;+44 1234567&quot;`. The
quotation marks appear because `v[&quot;name&quot;]` is a `&amp;Value` containing a JSON
string and its JSON representation is `&quot;John Doe&quot;`. Printing as a plain string
without quotation marks involves converting from a JSON string to a Rust string
with [`as_str()`] or avoiding the use of `Value` as described in the following
section.

[`as_str()`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/1/serde_json/enum.Value.html#method.as_str

The `Value` representation is sufficient for very basic tasks but can be tedious
to work with for anything more significant. Error handling is verbose to
implement correctly, for example imagine trying to detect the presence of
unrecognized fields in the input data. The compiler is powerless to help you
when you make a mistake, for example imagine typoing `v[&quot;name&quot;]` as `v[&quot;nmae&quot;]`
in one of the dozens of places it is used in your code.

## Parsing JSON as strongly typed data structures

Serde provides a powerful way of mapping JSON data into Rust data structures
largely automatically.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=15cfab66d38ff8a15a9cf1d8d897ac68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::Result;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    phones: Vec&lt;String&gt;,
}

fn typed_example() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Some JSON input data as a &amp;str. Maybe this comes from the user.
    let data = r#&quot;
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
            &quot;age&quot;: 43,
            &quot;phones&quot;: [
                &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
                &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
            ]
        }&quot;#;

    // Parse the string of data into a Person object. This is exactly the
    // same function as the one that produced serde_json::Value above, but
    // now we are asking it for a Person as output.
    let p: Person = serde_json::from_str(data)?;

    // Do things just like with any other Rust data structure.
    println!(&quot;Please call {} at the number {}&quot;, p.name, p.phones[0]);

    Ok(())
}
```

This is the same `serde_json::from_str` function as before, but this time we
assign the return value to a variable of type `Person` so Serde will
automatically interpret the input data as a `Person` and produce informative
error messages if the layout does not conform to what a `Person` is expected to
look like.

Any type that implements Serde&#039;s `Deserialize` trait can be deserialized this
way. This includes built-in Rust standard library types like `Vec&lt;T&gt;` and
`HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;`, as well as any structs or enums annotated with
`#[derive(Deserialize)]`.

Once we have `p` of type `Person`, our IDE and the Rust compiler can help us use
it correctly like they do for any other Rust code. The IDE can autocomplete
field names to prevent typos, which was impossible in the `serde_json::Value`
representation. And the Rust compiler can check that when we write
`p.phones[0]`, then `p.phones` is guaranteed to be a `Vec&lt;String&gt;` so indexing
into it makes sense and produces a `String`.

The necessary setup for using Serde&#039;s derive macros is explained on the *[Using
derive]* page of the Serde site.

[Using derive]: https://serde.rs/derive.html

## Constructing JSON values

Serde JSON provides a [`json!` macro][macro] to build `serde_json::Value`
objects with very natural JSON syntax.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=6ccafad431d72b62e77cc34c8e879b24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde_json::json;

fn main() {
    // The type of `john` is `serde_json::Value`
    let john = json!({
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
        &quot;age&quot;: 43,
        &quot;phones&quot;: [
            &quot;+44 1234567&quot;,
            &quot;+44 2345678&quot;
        ]
    });

    println!(&quot;first phone number: {}&quot;, john[&quot;phones&quot;][0]);

    // Convert to a string of JSON and print it out
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, john.to_string());
}
```

The `Value::to_string()` function converts a `serde_json::Value` into a `String`
of JSON text.

One neat thing about the `json!` macro is that variables and expressions can be
interpolated directly into the JSON value as you are building it. Serde will
check at compile time that the value you are interpolating is able to be
represented as JSON.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=f9101a6e61dfc9e02c6a67f315ed24f2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
let full_name = &quot;John Doe&quot;;
let age_last_year = 42;

// The type of `john` is `serde_json::Value`
let john = json!({
    &quot;name&quot;: full_name,
    &quot;age&quot;: age_last_year + 1,
    &quot;phones&quot;: [
        format!(&quot;+44 {}&quot;, random_phone())
    ]
});
```

This is amazingly convenient, but we have the problem we had before with
`Value`: the IDE and Rust compiler cannot help us if we get it wrong. Serde JSON
provides a better way of serializing strongly-typed data structures into JSON
text.

## Creating JSON by serializing data structures

A data structure can be converted to a JSON string by
[`serde_json::to_string`][to_string]. There is also
[`serde_json::to_vec`][to_vec] which serializes to a `Vec&lt;u8&gt;` and
[`serde_json::to_writer`][to_writer] which serializes to any `io::Write`
such as a File or a TCP stream.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2018&amp;gist=3472242a08ed2ff88a944f2a2283b0ee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serde-rs/serde-rs.github.io/master/img/runtab.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::Result;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Address {
    street: String,
    city: String,
}

fn print_an_address() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // Some data structure.
    let address = Address {
        street: &quot;10 Downing Street&quot;.to_owned(),
        city: &quot;London&quot;.to_owned(),
    };

    // Serialize it to a JSON string.
    let j = serde_json::to_string(&amp;address)?;

    // Print, write to a file, or send to an HTTP server.
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, j);

    Ok(())
}
```

Any type that implements Serde&#039;s `Serialize` trait can be serialized this way.
This includes built-in Rust standard library types like `Vec&lt;T&gt;` and `HashMap&lt;K,
V&gt;`, as well as any structs or enums annotated with `#[derive(Serialize)]`.

## Performance

It is fast. You should expect in the ballpark of 500 to 1000 megabytes per
second deserialization and 600 to 900 megabytes per second serialization,
depending on the characteristics of your data. This is competitive with the
fastest C and C++ JSON libraries or even 30% faster for many use cases.
Benchmarks live in the [serde-rs/json-benchmark] repo.

## No-std support

As long as there is a memory allocator, it is possible to use serde_json without
the rest of the Rust standard library. Disable the default &quot;std&quot; feature and
enable the &quot;alloc&quot; feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde_json = { version = &quot;1.0&quot;, default-features = false, features = [&quot;alloc&quot;] }
```

For JSON support in Serde without a memory allocator, please see the
[`serde-json-core`] crate.
