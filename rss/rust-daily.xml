&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

We are passionate about supporting contributors of all levels of experience and would love to see
you get involved in the project. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it&#039;s a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB&#039;s Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git&#039;s user interface hasn&#039;t been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed
- **Easy Commit Management**
  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping
- **Undo Timeline**
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation
- **GitHub Integration**
  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more
- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

## Example Uses

### Fixing a Bug While Working on a Feature

&gt; Say that while developing a feature, you encounter a bug that you wish to fix. It&#039;s often desirable that you ship the fix as a separate contribution (Pull request).

Using Git you can stash your changes and switch to another branch, where you can commit, and push your fix.

_With GitButler_ you simply assign your fix to a separate virtual branch, which you can individually push (or directly create a PR). An additional benefit is that you can retain the fix in your working directory while waiting for CI and/or code review.

### Trying Someone Else&#039;s Branch Together With My Work in Progress

&gt; Say you want to test a branch from someone else for the purpose of code review.

Using Git trying out someone else&#039;s branch is a full context switch away from your own work.
_With GitButler_ you can apply and unapply (add / remove) any remote branch directly into your working directory.

## Documentation

You can find our end user documentation at: https://docs.gitbutler.com

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),
or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## AI Commit Message Generation

Commit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.

Currently, GitButler uses OpenAI&#039;s API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI&#039;s servers.

Our goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).

LanceDB is an open-source database for vector-search built with persistent storage, which greatly simplifies retrieval, filtering and management of embeddings.

The key features of LanceDB include:

* Production-scale vector search with no servers to manage.

* Store, query and filter vectors, metadata and multi-modal data (text, images, videos, point clouds, and more).

* Support for vector similarity search, full-text search and SQL.

* Native Python and Javascript/Typescript support.

* Zero-copy, automatic versioning, manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.

* GPU support in building vector index(*).

* Ecosystem integrations with [LangChain 🦜️🔗](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/lancedb/), [LlamaIndex 🦙](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/LanceDBIndexDemo.html), Apache-Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB and more on the way.

LanceDB&#039;s core is written in Rust 🦀 and is built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lancedb/lance&quot;&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source columnar format designed for performant ML workloads.

## Quick Start

**Javascript**
```shell
npm install @lancedb/lancedb
```

```javascript
import * as lancedb from &quot;@lancedb/lancedb&quot;;

const db = await lancedb.connect(&quot;data/sample-lancedb&quot;);

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| c5n.metal      | al2 linux_5.10   | ubuntu 24.04 | linux_5.10   |
| m5n.metal      | al2023 linux_6.1 |              | linux_6.1    |
| m6i.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7i.metal-24xl |                  |              |              |
| m7i.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |
| m6a.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7a.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |
| m6g.metal      |                  |              |              |
| m7g.metal      |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

## :star2: Key Features

* Create and manage Lua projects
  - Easily manage dependencies, build steps and more through the `lux.toml` file.
* Parallel builds and installs :rocket:
* Add/remove dependencies with simple CLI commands
* Automatic generation of rockspecs
  - Say goodbye to managing 10 different rockspec files in your source code :tada:
* Integrated code formatting via `lx fmt`
  - Powered by [stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua).
* Easily specify compatible Lua versions
  - Lux will take care of Lua header installation automatically
  - Forget about users complaining they have the wrong Lua headers installed on their system
* Automatic code linting via `lx check`
  - Powered by `luacheck`.
* Powerful lockfile support
  - Makes for fully reproducible developer environments.
  - Makes Lux easy to integrate with Nix!
* Fully compatible
  - Works with existing luarocks packages.
  - Have a complex rockspec that you don&#039;t want to rewrite to TOML? No problem!
    Lux allows the creation of an `extra.rockspec` file, everything just works.
  - Have a very complex build script? Lux can shell out to `luarocks` if it knows it has
    to preserve maximum compatibility.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **Lux, while generally functional, is a work in progress
&gt; and does not have a `1.0` release yet.**

## :gear: How To Use

Feel free to consult the [documentation](https://nvim-neorocks.github.io/tutorial/getting-started) on how to get started with Lux!

It features a tutorial and several guides to make you good at managing Lua projects.

## :bar_chart: Comparison with `luarocks`

As this project is still a work in progress, some luarocks features
have not been (fully) implemented yet.
On the other hand, lux has some features that are not present in luarocks.

The following table provides a brief comparison:

[^1]: Supported via a compatibility layer that uses luarocks as a backend.
[^2]: [You Aren&#039;t Gonna Need It.](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)
[^3]: Mostly compatible with the luarocks version parser,
      which allows an arbitrary number of version components.
      To comply with SemVer, we treat anything after the third version component
      (except for the specrev) as a prerelease/build version.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc...).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you activated the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.44.2&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.70.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.39 to now  - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025. (MSRV 1.63)
 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.32.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.38&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

# Overview
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/arch-3?embed=true&amp;utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-arch&amp;#0045;3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=565761&amp;theme=dark&amp;period=daily&amp;t=1742359429995&quot; alt=&quot;Arch - Build&amp;#0032;fast&amp;#0044;&amp;#0032;hyper&amp;#0045;personalized&amp;#0032;agents&amp;#0032;with&amp;#0032;intelligent&amp;#0032;infra | Product Hunt&quot; style=&quot;width: 188px; height: 41px;&quot; width=&quot;188&quot; height=&quot;41&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Past the thrill of an AI demo, have you found yourself hitting these walls? You know, the all too familiar ones:

- You go from one BIG prompt to specialized prompts, but get stuck building **routing and handoff** code?
- You want use new LLMs, but struggle to **quickly and safely add LLMs** without writing integration code?
- You&#039;re bogged down with prompt engineering just to **clarify user intent and validate inputs** effectively?
- You&#039;re wasting cycles choosing and integrating code for **observability** instead of it happening transparently?

And you think to youself, can&#039;t I move faster by focusing on higher-level objectives in a language/framework agnostic way? Well, you can! **Arch Gateway** was built by the contributors of [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

&gt;Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems to improve speed and accuracy for common agentic scenarios  – all outside core application logic.*

**Core Features**:

  - `🚦 Routing`. Engineered with purpose-built [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-function-66f209a693ea8df14317ad68) for fast (&lt;100ms) agent routing and hand-off scenarios
  - `⚡ Tools Use`: For common agentic scenarios let Arch instantly clarfiy and convert prompts to tools/API calls
  - `⛨ Guardrails`: Centrally configure and prevent harmful outcomes and ensure safe user interactions
  - `🔗 Access to LLMs`: Centralize access and traffic to LLMs with smart retries for continuous availability
  - `🕵 Observability`: W3C compatible request tracing and LLM metrics that instantly plugin with popular tools
  - `🧱 Built on Envoy`: Arch runs alongside app servers as a containerized process, and builds on top of [Envoy&#039;s](https://envoyproxy.io) proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.

**Jump to our [docs](https://docs.archgw.com)** to learn how you can use Arch to improve the speed, security and personalization of your GenAI apps.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Today, the function calling LLM (Arch-Function) designed for the agentic and RAG scenarios is hosted free of charge in the US-central region. To offer consistent latencies and throughput, and to manage our expenses, we will enable access to the hosted version via developers keys soon, and give you the option to run that LLM locally. For more details see this issue [#258](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw/issues/258)

* [Sample App: Network Operator Agent](demos/samples_python/network_switch_operator_agent/README.md) - A simple network device switch operator agent that can retrive device statistics and reboot them.
* [User Case: Connecting to SaaS APIs](demos/use_cases/spotify_bearer_auth) - Connect 3rd party SaaS APIs to your agentic chat experience.

## Quickstart

Follow this quickstart guide to use arch gateway to build a simple AI agent. Laster in the section we will see how you can Arch Gateway to manage access keys, provide unified access to upstream LLMs and to provide e2e observability.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. [Docker System](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (v24)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.29)
3. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.12)

Arch&#039;s CLI allows you to manage and interact with the Arch gateway efficiently. To install the CLI, simply run the following command:

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend that developers create a new Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies before installing Arch. This ensures that archgw and its dependencies do not interfere with other packages on your system.

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install archgw==0.2.5
```

### Build AI Agent with Arch Gateway

In following quickstart we will show you how easy it is to build AI agent with Arch gateway. We will build a currency exchange agent using following simple steps. For this demo we will use `https://api.frankfurter.dev/` to fetch latest price for currencies and assume USD as base currency.

#### Step 1. Create arch config file

Create `arch_config.yaml` file with following content,

```yaml
version: v0.1

listener:
  address: 0.0.0.0
  port: 10000
  message_format: huggingface
  connect_timeout: 0.005s

llm_providers:
  - name: gpt-4o
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o

system_prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

prompt_guards:
  input_guards:
    jailbreak:
      on_exception:
        message: Looks like you&#039;re curious about my abilities, but I can only provide assistance for currency exchange.

prompt_targets:
  - name: currency_exchange
    description: Get currency exchange rate from USD to other currencies
    parameters:
      - name: currency_symbol
        description: the currency that needs conversion
        required: true
        type: str
        in_path: true
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/latest?base=USD&amp;symbols={currency_symbol}
    system_prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant. Show me the currency symbol you want to convert from USD.

  - name: get_supported_currencies
    description: Get list of supported currencies for conversion
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/currencies

endpoints:
  frankfurther_api:
    endpoint: api.frankfurter.dev:443
    protocol: https
```

#### Step 2. Start arch gateway with currency conversion config

```sh

$ archgw up arch_config.yaml
2024-12-05 16:56:27,979 - cli.main - INFO - Starting archgw cli version: 0.1.5
...
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.utils - INFO - Schema validation successful!
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.main - INFO - Starging arch model server and arch gateway
...
2024-12-05 16:56:51,647 - cli.core - INFO - Container is healthy!

```

Once the gateway is up you can start interacting with at port 10000 using openai chat completion API.

Some of the sample queries you can ask could be `what is currency rate for gbp?` or `show me list of currencies for conversion`.

#### Step 3. Interacting with gateway using curl command

Here is a sample curl command you can use to interact,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;what is exchange rate for gbp&quot;}]}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;As of the date provided in your context, December 5, 2024, the exchange rate for GBP (British Pound) from USD (United States Dollar) is 0.78558. This means that 1 USD is equivalent to 0.78558 GBP.&quot;

```

And to get list of supported currencies,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;show me list of currencies that are supported for conversion&quot;}]}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;Here is a list of the currencies that are supported for conversion from USD, along with their symbols:\n\n1. AUD - Australian Dollar\n2. BGN - Bulgarian Lev\n3. BRL - Brazilian Real\n4. CAD - Canadian Dollar\n5. CHF - Swiss Franc\n6. CNY - Chinese Renminbi Yuan\n7. CZK - Czech Koruna\n8. DKK - Danish Krone\n9. EUR - Euro\n10. GBP - British Pound\n11. HKD - Hong Kong Dollar\n12. HUF - Hungarian Forint\n13. IDR - Indonesian Rupiah\n14. ILS - Israeli New Sheqel\n15. INR - Indian Rupee\n16. ISK - Icelandic Króna\n17. JPY - Japanese Yen\n18. KRW - South Korean Won\n19. MXN - Mexican Peso\n20. MYR - Malaysian Ringgit\n21. NOK - Norwegian Krone\n22. NZD - New Zealand Dollar\n23. PHP - Philippine Peso\n24. PLN - Polish Złoty\n25. RON - Romanian Leu\n26. SEK - Swedish Krona\n27. SGD - Singapore Dollar\n28. THB - Thai Baht\n29. TRY - Turkish Lira\n30. USD - United States Dollar\n31. ZAR - South African Rand\n\nIf you want to convert USD to any of these currencies, you can select the one you are interested in.&quot;

```

### Use Arch Gateway as LLM Router

#### Step 1. Create arch config file

Arch operates based on a configuration file where you can define LLM providers, prompt targets, guardrails, etc. Below is an example configuration that defines openai and mistral LLM providers.

Create `arch_config.yaml` file with following content:

```yaml
version: v0.1

listener:
  address: 0.0.0.0
  port: 10000
  message_format: huggingface
  connect_timeout: 0.005s

llm_providers:
  - name: gpt-4o
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    default: true

  - name: ministral-3b
    access_key: $MISTRAL_API_KEY
    provider: openai
    model: ministral-3b-latest
```

#### Step 2. Start arch gateway

Once the config file is created ensure that you have env vars setup for `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or these are defined in `.env` file).

Start arch gateway,

```
$ archgw up arch_config.yaml
2024-12-05 11:24:51,288 - cli.main - INFO - Starting archgw cli version: 0.1.5
2024-12-05 11:24:51,825 - cli.utils - INFO - Schema validation successful!
2024-12-05 11:24:51,825 - cli.main - INFO - Starting arch model server and arch gateway
...
2024-12-05 11:25:16,131 - cli.core - INFO - Container is healthy!
```

### Step 3: Interact with LLM

#### Step 3.1: Using OpenAI python client

Make outbound calls via Arch gateway

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Use the OpenAI client as usual
client = OpenAI(
  # No need to set a specific openai.api_key since it&#039;s configured in Arch&#039;s gateway
  api_key = &#039;--&#039;,
  # Set the OpenAI API base URL to the Arch gateway endpoint
  base_url = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:12000/v1&quot;
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    # we select model from arch_config file
    model=&quot;None&quot;,
    messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}],
)

print(&quot;OpenAI Response:&quot;, response.choices[0].message.content)

```

#### Step 3.2: Using curl command
```
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}]}&#039; \
  http://localhost:12000/v1/chat/completions

{
  ...
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o-2024-08-06&quot;,
  &quot;choices&quot;: [
    {
      ...
      &quot;message&quot;: {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The capital of France is Paris.&quot;,
      },
    }
  ],
...
}

```

You can override model selection using `x-arch-llm-provider-hint` header. For example if you want to use mistral using following curl command,

```
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --header &#039;x-arch-llm-provider-hint: ministral-3b&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}]}&#039; \
  http://localhost:12000/v1/chat/completions
{
  ...
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;ministral-3b-latest&quot;,
  &quot;choices&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;message&quot;: {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The capital of France is Paris. It is the most populous city in France and is known for its iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris is also a major global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.&quot;,
      },
      ...
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

## [Observability](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html)
Arch is designed to support best-in class observability by supporting open standards. Please read our [docs](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html) on observability for more details on tracing, metrics, and logs. The screenshot below is from our integration with Signoz (among others)

![alt text](docs/source/_static/img/tracing.png)

## Debugging

When debugging issues / errors application logs and access logs provide key information to give you more context on whats going on with the system. Arch gateway runs in info log level and following is a typical output you could see in a typical interaction between developer and arch gateway,

```
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground
...
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.350][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_request_body: sending request to model server
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.851][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: model server response received
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.852][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: dispatching api call to developer endpoint: weather_forecast_service, path: /weather, method: POST
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.882][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: developer api call response received: status code: 200
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.882][26][info] prompt_gateway: on_http_call_response: sending request to upstream llm
[2025-03-26 18:32:01.883][26][info] llm_gateway: on_http_request_body: provider: gpt-4o-mini, model requested: None, model selected: gpt-4o-mini
[2025-03-26 18:32:02.818][26][info] llm_gateway: on_http_response_body: time to first token: 1468ms
[2025-03-26 18:32:04.532][26][info] llm_gateway: on_http_response_body: request latency: 3183ms
...
```

Log level can be changed to debug to get more details. To enable debug logs edit (Dockerfile)[arch/Dockerfile], change the log level `--component-log-level wasm:info` to `--component-log-level wasm:debug`. And after that you need to rebuild docker image and restart the arch gateway using following set of commands,

```
# make sure you are at the root of the repo
$ archgw build
# go to your service that has arch_config.yaml file and issue following command,
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground
```

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

***If you&#039;ll click on the image, you&#039;ll be led to an SVG version of it on the website where you can directly click on every issue***

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we’ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:
* We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    * Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    * Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
* We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.
* We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
* We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
* We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth Book](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.85.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html).

See the book for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source.html).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
# Without Geth
cargo test --workspace

# With Geth
cargo test --workspace --features geth-tests

# With Ethereum Foundation tests
#
# Note: Requires cloning https://github.com/ethereum/tests
#
#   cd testing/ef-tests &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/ethereum/tests ethereum-tests
cargo test -p ef-tests --features ef-tests
```

We recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing. With nextest installed, simply substitute `cargo test` with `cargo nextest run`.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [book][book].

If the answer is not there:

- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[wcc]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/
[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions), or
send an IRC message to [`#jujutsu` on Libera
Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#jujutsu). The developers monitor all of
these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) C library and the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [&quot;co-located&quot; local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary&#039;s name may change (i.e.
away from `jj`). For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so

S3 Terminal UI 🪣

&lt;img src=&quot;./img/demo.gif&quot;&gt;

## About

STU is the TUI explorer application for Amazon S3 (AWS S3) written in Rust using [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui).

STU provides the following features:

- Recursive download of objects
- Preview with syntax highlighting for text and image rendering
- Access to past versions of objects
- Customizable key bindings
- Support for S3-compatible storage

Check out the [Features / Screenshots](#features--screenshots) section for more details!

## Installation

### [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/stu)

```
$ cargo install --locked stu
```

### [Homebrew (macOS)](https://github.com/lusingander/homebrew-tap/blob/master/stu.rb)

```
$ brew install lusingander/tap/stu
```

### [AUR (Arch Linux)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stu)

```
$ paru -S stu
```

### Binary

You can download binaries from [releases](https://github.com/lusingander/stu/releases).

## Usage

After installation, run the following command:

```
$ stu
```

Basically, you can use it in [the same way as the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

In other words, if the default profile settings exist or [the environment variables are set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html), you do not need to specify any options.

### Options

```
STU - S3 Terminal UI

Usage: stu [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -r, --region &lt;REGION&gt;     AWS region
  -e, --endpoint-url &lt;URL&gt;  AWS endpoint url
  -p, --profile &lt;NAME&gt;      AWS profile name
  -b, --bucket &lt;NAME&gt;       Target bucket name
      --path-style &lt;TYPE&gt;   Path style type for object paths [default: auto] [possible values: auto, always, never]
      --debug               Enable debug logs
  -h, --help                Print help
  -V, --version             Print version
```

Here are some examples of how to run with options:

```sh
# Connect by specifying the profile
$ stu --profile foo-profile

# Show only the specified bucket objects
$ stu --bucket bar-bucket

# Connect to localstack, minio, etc.
$ stu --endpoint-url http://localhost:12345

# Connect by specifying environment variables
$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xyz stu
```

#### --path-style \&lt;TYPE\&gt;

Select the address model for S3 objects.

- `never` uses Virtual-Hosted Style, which is what AWS currently uses.
  - `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key`
- `always` uses Path Style, which is used when using localstack, minio, etc.
  - `https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key`
- `auto` automatically determines which model to use, which is the default setting.

For other S3-compatible services, which one to use depends on the service.

### Keybindings

#### Default

The basic key bindings are as follows:

| Key                  | Description                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl-C&lt;/kbd&gt;    | Quit app                     |
| &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt;     | Confirm / Open selected item |
| &lt;kbd&gt;Backspace&lt;/kbd&gt; | Go back to previous          |
| &lt;kbd&gt;j/k&lt;/kbd&gt;       | Select item / Scroll         |
| &lt;kbd&gt;?&lt;/kbd&gt;         | Show help                    |

Detailed operations on each view can be displayed by pressing `?` key.

#### Custom keybindings

You can set your own custom key bindings.

Custom bindings are loaded from `$STU_ROOT_DIR/keybindings.toml`.

The default key bindings are defined in [./assets/keybindings.toml](./assets/keybindings.toml). You can set key bindings for each screen action in the same format.

- It is possible to set multiple key bindings for one action.
- If you do not set key bindings for an action, the default key bindings will be assigned.
- You can disable an action by setting `[]` as the key bindings.

### Config

Config is loaded from `$STU_ROOT_DIR/config.toml`.

- If `STU_ROOT_DIR` environment variable is not set, `~/.stu` is used by default.
  - If the `STU_ROOT_DIR` directory does not exist, it will be created automatically.
- If the config file does not exist, the default values will be used for all items.
- If the config file exists but some items are not set, the default values will be used for those unset items.

#### Config file format

The values set in this example are the default values.

```toml
# The directory to save the downloaded objects.
# type: string
download_dir = &quot;$STU_ROOT_DIR/download&quot;
# The maximum number of concurrent requests when recursive downloading objects.
# type: usize
max_concurrent_requests = 5
# The default region to use if the region cannot be obtained from the command line options or AWS settings.
# type: string
default_region = &quot;us-east-1&quot;

[ui.object_list]
# The date format of a last modified in the object list.
# The format must be specified in strftime format.
# https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
# type: string
date_format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;
# The width of a last modified in the object list.
# It is recommended to set this when setting date_format.
# type: u16
date_width = 19

[ui.object_detail]
# The date format of a last modified in the object detail.
# The format must be specified in strftime format.
# https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
# type: string
date_format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;

[ui.help]
# The maximum width of the keybindings display area in the help.
# type: usize
max_help_width = 100

[preview]
# Whether syntax highlighting is enabled in the object preview.
# type: bool
highlight = false
# The name of the color theme to use for syntax highlighting in the object preview.
# type: string
highlight_theme = &quot;base16-ocean.dark&quot;
# Whether image file preview is enabled in the object preview.
# type: bool
image = false
# Array of labels for the encoding want to use.
# Label names should be specified from https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels.
# type: array of strings
encodings = [
  &quot;utf-8&quot;,
  &quot;utf-16be&quot;,
  &quot;utf-16le&quot;,
]
```

### Syntax highlighting

In the object preview, Syntax highlighting using syntect is available. To enable this, set `preview.highlight = true` in the config file.

#### Color themes

You can change the color theme by specifying the theme name in `preview.highlight_theme`.

By default the following themes are available:

- `base16-ocean.dark`
- `base16-eighties.dark`
- `base16-mocha.dark`
- `base16-ocean.light`
  - https://github.com/SublimeText/Spacegray
- `InspiredGitHub`
  - https://github.com/sethlopez/InspiredGitHub.tmtheme
- `Solarized (dark)`
- `Solarized (light)`
  - https://github.com/altercation/solarized

Also, by creating `xxx.tmTheme` in `$STU_ROOT_DIR/preview_theme/`, you can use `xxx` and load it.

#### Syntax definitions

You can add syntax definitions for file types that are not supported by default. You can use it by creating a `.sublime-syntax` file in `$STU_ROOT_DIR/preview_syntax/`.

https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html

## Troubleshooting

- If you&#039;re having trouble connecting, first verify that the AWS CLI can successfully access the same S3 resources:
  - Are your AWS credentials configured properly?
    - This includes checking `~/.aws/credentials`, environment variables, or any credential provider chain used by the AWS CLI.
  - Are the necessary permissions set correctly?
    - This includes IAM policies, roles, and bucket policies that allow operations like `s3:ListBucket` or `s3:GetObject`.
  - If you&#039;re using an S3-compatible service:
    - Is the `endpoint-url` set correctly?
    - Are you using the appropriate `path-style` access setting?
- If an error occurs, check the error log at `$STU_ROOT_DIR/error.log`.
  - For more detailed information, run with the `--debug` flag and inspect `$STU_ROOT_DIR/debug.log`.
    - Currently, the debug log only includes application-level events and logs from the AWS SDK.

# Leptos

```rust
use leptos::*;

#[component]
pub fn SimpleCounter(initial_value: i32) -&gt; impl IntoView {
    // create a reactive signal with the initial value
    let (value, set_value) = signal(initial_value);

    // create event handlers for our buttons
    // note that `value` and `set_value` are `Copy`, so it&#039;s super easy to move them into closures
    let clear = move |_| set_value(0);
    let decrement = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value -= 1);
    let increment = move |_| set_value.update(|value| *value += 1);

    // create user interfaces with the declarative `view!` macro
    view! {
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=clear&gt;Clear&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button on:click=decrement&gt;-1&lt;/button&gt;

            &lt;button on:click=increment&gt;+1&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

}

// Easy to use with Trunk (trunkrs.dev) or with a simple wasm-bindgen setup
pub fn main() {
    mount_to_body(|| view! {
        &lt;SimpleCounter initial_value=3 /&gt;
    })
}
```

## About the Framework

Leptos is a full-stack, isomorphic Rust web framework leveraging fine-grained reactivity to build declarative user interfaces.

## What does that mean?

- **Full-stack**: Leptos can be used to build apps that run in the browser (client-side rendering), on the server (server-side rendering), or by rendering HTML on the server and then adding interactivity in the browser (server-side rendering with hydration). This includes support for HTTP streaming of both data ([`Resource`s](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/struct.Resource.html)) and HTML (out-of-order or in-order streaming of [`&lt;Suspense/&gt;`](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/fn.Suspense.html) components.)
- **Isomorphic**: Leptos provides primitives to write isomorphic [server functions](https://docs.rs/leptos_server/0.2.5/leptos_server/index.html), i.e., functions that can be called with the “same shape” on the client or server, but only run on the server. This means you can write your server-only logic (database requests, authentication etc.) alongside the client-side components that will consume it, and call server functions as if they were running in the browser, without needing to create and maintain a separate REST or other API.
- **Web**: Leptos is built on the Web platform and Web standards. The [router](https://docs.rs/leptos_router/latest/leptos_router/) is designed to use Web fundamentals (like links and forms) and build on top of them rather than trying to replace them.
- **Framework**: Leptos provides most of what you need to build a modern web app: a reactive system, templating library, and a router that works on both the server and client side.
- **Fine-grained reactivity**: The entire framework is built from reactive primitives. This allows for extremely performant code with minimal overhead: when a reactive signal’s value changes, it can update a single text node, toggle a single class, or remove an element from the DOM without any other code running. (So, no virtual DOM overhead!)
- **Declarative**: Tell Leptos how you want the page to look, and let the framework tell the browser how to do it.

## Learn more

Here are some resources for learning more about Leptos:

- [Book](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/) (work in progress)
- [Examples](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples)
- [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/)
- [Common Bugs](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/docs/COMMON_BUGS.md) (and how to fix them!)

## `nightly` Note

Most of the examples assume you’re using `nightly` version of Rust and the `nightly` feature of Leptos. To use `nightly` Rust, you can either set your toolchain globally or on per-project basis.

To set `nightly` as a default toolchain for all projects (and add the ability to compile Rust to WebAssembly, if you haven’t already):

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

If you&#039;d like to use `nightly` only in your Leptos project however, add [`rust-toolchain.toml`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) file with the following content:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = &quot;nightly&quot;
targets = [&quot;wasm32-unknown-unknown&quot;]
```

The `nightly` feature enables the function call syntax for accessing and setting signals, as opposed to `.get()` and `.set()`. This leads to a consistent mental model in which accessing a reactive value of any kind (a signal, memo, or derived signal) is always represented as a function call. This is only possible with nightly Rust and the `nightly` feature.

## `cargo-leptos`

[`cargo-leptos`](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos) is a build tool that&#039;s designed to make it easy to build apps that run on both the client and the server, with seamless integration. The best way to get started with a real Leptos project right now is to use `cargo-leptos` and our starter templates for [Actix](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start) or [Axum](https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-axum).

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
cargo leptos new --git https://github.com/leptos-rs/start
cd [your project name]
cargo leptos watch
```

Open browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## FAQs

### What’s up with the name?

_Leptos_ (λεπτός) is an ancient Greek word meaning “thin, light, refined, fine-grained.” To me, a classicist and not a dog owner, it evokes the lightweight reactive system that powers the framework. I&#039;ve since learned the same word is at the root of the medical term “leptospirosis,” a blood infection that affects humans and animals... My bad. No dogs were harmed in the creation of this framework.

### Is it production ready?

People usually mean one of three things by this question.

1. **Are the APIs stable?** i.e., will I have to rewrite my whole app from Leptos 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.3 to 0.4, or can I write it now and benefit from new features and updates as new versions come?

The APIs are basically settled. We’re adding new features, but we’re very happy with where the type system and patterns have landed. I would not expect major breaking changes to your code to adapt to future releases, in terms of architecture.

2. **Are there bugs?**

Yes, I’m sure there are. You can see from the state of our issue tracker over time that there aren’t that _many_ bugs and they’re usually resolved pretty quickly. But for sure, there may be moments where you encounter something that requires a fix at the framework level, which may not be immediately resolved.

3. **Am I a consumer or a contributor?**

This may be the big one: “production ready” implies a certain orientation to a library: that you can basically use it, without any special knowledge of its internals or ability to contribute. Everyone has this at some level in their stack: for example I (@gbj) don’t have the capacity or knowledge to contribute to something like `wasm-bindgen` at this point: I simply rely on it to work.

There are several people in the community using Leptos right now for internal apps at work, who have also become significant contributors. I think this is the right level of production use for now. There may be missing features that you need, and you may end up building them! But for internal apps, if you’re willing to build and contribute missing pieces along the way, the framework is definitely usable right now.

### Can I use this for native GUI?

Sure! Obviously the `view` macro is for generating DOM nodes but you can use the reactive system to drive any native GUI toolkit that uses the same kind of object-oriented, event-callback-based framework as the DOM pretty easily. The principles are the same:

- Use signals, derived signals, and memos to create your reactive system
- Create GUI widgets
- Use event listeners to update signals
- Create effects to update the UI

The 0.7 update originally set out to create a &quot;generic rendering&quot; approach that would allow us to reuse most of the same view logic to do all of the above. Unfortunately, this has had to be shelved for now due to difficulties encountered by the Rust compiler when building larger-scale applications with the number of generics spread throughout the codebase that this required. It&#039;s an approach I&#039;m looking forward to exploring again in the future; feel free to reach out if you&#039;re interested in this kind of work.

### How is this different from Yew?

Yew is the most-used library for Rust web UI development, but there are several differences between Yew and Leptos, in philosophy, approach, and performance.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** Yew is built on the virtual DOM (VDOM) model: state changes cause components to re-render, generating a new virtual DOM tree. Yew diffs this against the previous VDOM, and applies those patches to the actual DOM. Component functions rerun whenever state changes. Leptos takes an entirely different approach. Components run once, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Performance:** This has huge performance implications: Leptos is simply much faster at both creating and updating the UI than Yew is.
- **Server integration:** Yew was created in an era in which browser-rendered single-page apps (SPAs) were the dominant paradigm. While Leptos supports client-side rendering, it also focuses on integrating with the server side of your application via server functions and multiple modes of serving HTML, including out-of-order streaming.

### How is this different from Dioxus?

Like Leptos, Dioxus is a framework for building UIs using web technologies. However, there are significant differences in approach and features.

- **VDOM vs. fine-grained:** While Dioxus has a performant virtual DOM (VDOM), it still uses coarse-grained/component-scoped reactivity: changing a stateful value reruns the component function and diffs the old UI against the new one. Leptos components use a different mental model, creating (and returning) actual DOM nodes and setting up a reactive system to update those DOM nodes.
- **Web vs. desktop priorities:** Dioxus uses Leptos server functions in its fullstack mode, but does not have the same `&lt;Suspense&gt;`-based support for things like streaming HTML rendering, or share the same focus on holistic web performance. Leptos tends to prioritize holistic web performance (streaming HTML rendering, smaller WASM binary sizes, etc.), whereas Dioxus has an unparalleled experience when building desktop apps, because your application logic runs as a native Rust binary.

### How is this different from Sycamore?

Sycamore and Leptos are both heavily influenced by SolidJS. At this point, Leptos has a larger community and ecosystem and is more actively developed. Other differences:

- **Templating DSLs:** Sycamore uses a custom templating language for its views, while Leptos uses a JSX-like template format.
- **`&#039;static` signals:** One of Leptos’s main innovations was the creation of `Copy + &#039;static` signals, which have excellent ergonomics. Sycamore is in the process of adopting the same pattern, but this is not yet released.
- **Perseus vs. server functions:** The Perseus metaframework provides an opinionated way to build Sycamore apps that include server functionality. Leptos instead provides primitives like server functions in the core of the framework.

该工具用于导出正在运行中的微信进程的 key 并自动解密所有微信数据库文件以及导出 key 后数据库文件离线解密。

&gt; **可能存在封号风险，后果自负！！！**

## 工具用法

```bash
wechat-dump-rs (1.0.3) - REinject
A wechat db dump tool
Options:
  -p, --pid &lt;PID&gt;        pid of wechat
  -k, --key &lt;KEY&gt;        key for offline decryption of db file
  -f, --file &lt;PATH&gt;      special a db file path
  -d, --data-dir &lt;PATH&gt;  special wechat data dir path (pid is required)
  -o, --output &lt;PATH&gt;    decrypted database output path
  -h, --help             Print help
```

如果不带任何参数，程序只输出所有微信进程的 key、微信号、登录设备、数据目录、版本等信息：

```bash
=======================================
ProcessId: 12768
WechatVersion: 3.9.7.25
AccountName: nihao123
PhoneType: iphone
DataDir: C:\Users\test\Documents\WeChat Files\wxid_uy9q2sudtiqv22
key: b16aa99b8e8323f6bb0ebf2ef83ff88f2e47d86d913345933a7168d55aa7e362
=======================================
```

使用参数 `-a` 可以直接导出所有数据库文件。

## 原理

一般情况下，key 要在运行的微信进程内存中拿到，内存偏移在每个版本都不一样，大部分工具是对每个版本维护一套偏移，但是当出现新版本的时候都要重新找偏移，方法见后面有简单记录。

其实，除了这个方法外，还有一个更通用的方法就是内存暴力搜索找到能用于解密的密钥位置，当然如果对进程全部内存扫一遍肯定不行，所以项目里用下面这种方式缩小密钥内存范围加快扫描速度：

1. 微信登录设备类型基本只有 iphone、android，在内存中先搜到设备类型所在内存，key 就在它的前面，向前搜就行
2. key 的内存地址和登录设备类型据我观察是 16 字节对齐的，所以每次向前 16 字节

还有其它一些小细节，直接看一下代码吧。

## 已测试版本列表

其它未测试版本不代表不能用，这个列表只是我本地有过的环境。

- 3.9.6.33
- 3.9.7.25
- 3.9.7.29
- 3.9.8.9
- 3.9.8.15
- 3.9.10.19
- 3.9.11.25
- 3.9.12.15
- 3.9.12.17

## 如何手动寻找偏移

&gt; 注意：我找的偏移不是其他人找的直接的内存偏移，而是微信的一个数据结构相对偏移，这个有什么用呢，我刚开始打算通过 yara 扫 `WeChatWin.dll` 二进制文件确定一个相对偏移，然后根据内存中找到的设备类型地址就能直接推算出其它数据的内存地址，通不通用的关键就在于 yara 了，我没写出通用的，所以才改成了上面的思路。

使用 CheatEngine 在内存中搜索找到 key 或微信号的内存地址，必须是在 `WeChatWin.dll` 内存范围内，然后使用 x64dbg 动态调试，在 key 地址下硬件内存访问断点，之后登录微信后可中断到一个地方，然后一直向上回溯可以找到偏移。

以微信号为例，在 CE 中搜索，我这里使用第二个地址，因为它和 key 的位置比较近：

![1.png](images/1.png)
![2.png](images/2.png)

在 x64dbg 中跳过去

![3.png](images/3.png)

加个硬件访问断点

![4.png](images/4.png)

然后会自动断下或者需要重启后重新登录断下，`r12` 寄存器当前地址就是微信号所在地址：

![5.png](images/5.png)

在这个指令这里右键复制文件偏移，在 ida 中打开 `wechatwin.dll` 跳转过去：

![6.png](images/6.png)

之后，到 ida 可以很明显看到 `r12` 的地址来自于 `sub_1808D2FA0：`

![7.png](images/7.png)

在 `sub_1808D2FA0` 的最后可以拿到一个地址 `183B28120` ：

![8.png](images/8.png)

`183B28120` + `720` - `180000000` = `3B28840`

![9.png](images/9.png)

在 x64dbg 中就可以根据这个文件偏移明确找到微信号的位置，和最初 CE 里搜到的地址一致：

![10.png](images/10.png)

通过同样的方式，分别找到 nickname、phone、key 的相对偏移。

nickename：`183B28120` + `1E8` - `180000000` = `3B28308`

TiKV is an open-source, distributed, and transactional key-value database. Unlike other traditional NoSQL systems, TiKV not only provides classical key-value APIs, but also transactional APIs with ACID compliance. Built in Rust and powered by Raft, TiKV was originally created by [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com) to complement [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), a distributed HTAP database compatible with the MySQL protocol.

The design of TiKV (&#039;Ti&#039; stands for titanium) is inspired by some great distributed systems from Google, such as BigTable, Spanner, and Percolator, and some of the latest achievements in academia in recent years, such as the Raft consensus algorithm.

If you&#039;re interested in contributing to TiKV, or want to build it from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

TiKV is a graduated project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who&#039;s involved and how TiKV plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).

---

With the implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust and consensus state stored in RocksDB, TiKV guarantees data consistency. [Placement Driver (PD)](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/), which is introduced to implement auto-sharding, enables automatic data migration. The transaction model is similar to Google&#039;s Percolator with some performance improvements. TiKV also provides snapshot isolation (SI), snapshot isolation with lock (SQL: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and externally consistent reads and writes in distributed transactions.

TiKV has the following key features:

- **Geo-Replication**

    TiKV uses [Raft](http://raft.github.io/) and the Placement Driver to support Geo-Replication.

- **Horizontal scalability**

    With PD and carefully designed Raft groups, TiKV excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ TBs of data.

- **Consistent distributed transactions**

    Similar to Google&#039;s Spanner, TiKV supports externally-consistent distributed transactions.

- **Coprocessor support**

    Similar to HBase, TiKV implements a coprocessor framework to support distributed computing.

- **Cooperates with [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)**

    Thanks to the internal optimization, TiKV and TiDB can work together to be a compelling database solution with high horizontal scalability, externally-consistent transactions, support for RDBMS, and NoSQL design patterns.

## TiKV software stack

![The TiKV software stack](images/tikv_stack.png)

- **Placement Driver:** PD is the cluster manager of TiKV, which periodically checks replication constraints to balance load and data automatically.
- **Store:** There is a RocksDB within each Store and it stores data into the local disk.
- **Region:** Region is the basic unit of Key-Value data movement. Each Region is replicated to multiple Nodes. These multiple replicas form a Raft group.
- **Node:** A physical node in the cluster. Within each node, there are one or more Stores. Within each Store, there are many Regions.

When a node starts, the metadata of the Node, Store and Region are recorded into PD. The status of each Region and Store is reported to PD regularly.

## Quick start

### Deploy a playground with TiUP

The most quickest to try out TiKV with TiDB is using TiUP, a component manager for TiDB.

You can see [this page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/quick-start-with-tidb#deploy-a-local-test-environment-using-tiup-playground) for a step by step tutorial.

### Deploy a playground with binary

TiKV is able to run separately with PD, which is the minimal deployment required.

1. Download and extract binaries.

```bash
$ export TIKV_VERSION=v7.5.0
$ export GOOS=darwin  # only {darwin, linux} are supported
$ export GOARCH=amd64 # only {amd64, arm64} are supported
$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz
```

2. Start PD instance.

```bash
$ ./pd-server --name=pd --data-dir=/tmp/pd/data --client-urls=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2379&quot; --peer-urls=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:2380&quot; --initial-cluster=&quot;pd=http://127.0.0.1:2380&quot; --log-file=/tmp/pd/log/pd.log
```

3. Start TiKV instance.

```bash
$ ./tikv-server --pd-endpoints=&quot;127.0.0.1:2379&quot; --addr=&quot;127.0.0.1:20160&quot; --data-dir=/tmp/tikv/data --log-file=/tmp/tikv/log/tikv.log
```

4. Install TiKV Client(Python) and verify the deployment, required Python 3.5+.

```bash
$ pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ tikv-client
```

```python
from tikv_client import RawClient

client = RawClient.connect(&quot;127.0.0.1:2379&quot;)

client.put(b&#039;foo&#039;, b&#039;bar&#039;)
print(client.get(b&#039;foo&#039;)) # b&#039;bar&#039;

client.put(b&#039;foo&#039;, b&#039;baz&#039;)
print(client.get(b&#039;foo&#039;)) # b&#039;baz&#039;
```

# 🙋 FAQ

### How can I switch from Elasticsearch or OpenSearch to Quickwit?

Quickwit supports a large subset of Elasticsearch/OpenSearch API.

For instance, it has an ES-compatible ingest API to make it easier to migrate your log shippers (Vector, Fluent Bit, Syslog, ...) to Quickwit.

On the search side, the most popular Elasticsearch endpoints, query DSL, and even aggregations are supported.

The list of available endpoints and queries is available [here](https://quickwit.io/docs/reference/es_compatible_api), while the list of supported aggregations is available [here](https://quickwit.io/docs/reference/aggregation).

Let us know if part of the API you are using is missing!

If the client you are using is refusing to connect to Quickwit due to missing headers, you can use the `extra_headers` option in the [node configuration](https://quickwit.io/docs/configuration/node-config#rest-configuration) to impersonate any compatible version of Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

### How is Quickwit different from traditional search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr?

The core difference and advantage of Quickwit is its architecture built from the ground to search on cloud storage. We optimized IO paths, revamped the index data structures and made search stateless and sub-second on cloud storage.

### How does Quickwit compare to Elastic in terms of cost?

We estimate that Quickwit can be up to 10x cheaper on average than Elastic. To understand how, check out our [blog post](https://quickwit.io/blog/commoncrawl/) about searching the web on AWS S3.

### What license does Quickwit use?

Quickwit is open-source under the Apache License, Version 2.0 - Apache-2.0.

### Is it possible to set up Quickwit for a High Availability (HA)?

HA is available for search, for indexing it&#039;s available only with a Kafka source.
