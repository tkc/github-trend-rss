            <h2>README</h2><pre># LiteBox

&gt; A security-focused library OS

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; This project is currently actively evolving and improving. While we are
&gt; working toward a stable release, some APIs and interfaces may change as the
&gt; design continues to mature. You are welcome to explore and experiment, but if
&gt; you need long-term stability, it may be best to wait for a stable release, or
&gt; be prepared to adapt to updates along the way.

LiteBox is a sandboxing library OS that drastically cuts down the interface to the host, thereby reducing attack surface.  It focuses on easy interop of various &quot;North&quot; shims and &quot;South&quot; platforms.  LiteBox is designed for usage in both kernel and non-kernel scenarios.

LiteBox exposes a Rust-y [`nix`](https://docs.rs/nix)/[`rustix`](https://docs.rs/rustix)-inspired &quot;North&quot; interface when it is provided a `Platform` interface at its &quot;South&quot;.  These interfaces allow for a wide variety of use-cases, easily allowing for connection between any of the North--South pairs.

Example use cases include:
- Running unmodified Linux programs on Windows
- Sandboxing Linux applications on Linux
- Run programs on top of SEV SNP
- Running OP-TEE programs on Linux
- Running on LVBS

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it&#039;s a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB&#039;s Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git&#039;s user interface hasn&#039;t been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed
- **Easy Commit Management**
  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping
- **Undo Timeline**
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation
- **GitHub Integration**
  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more
- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

## Example Uses

### Fixing a Bug While Working on a Feature

&gt; Say that while developing a feature, you encounter a bug that you wish to fix. It&#039;s often desirable that you ship the fix as a separate contribution (Pull request).

Using Git you can stash your changes and switch to another branch, where you can commit, and push your fix.

_With GitButler_ you simply assign your fix to a separate virtual branch, which you can individually push (or directly create a PR). An additional benefit is that you can retain the fix in your working directory while waiting for CI and/or code review.

### Trying Someone Else&#039;s Branch Together With My Work in Progress

&gt; Say you want to test a branch from someone else for the purpose of code review.

Using Git trying out someone else&#039;s branch is a full context switch away from your own work.
_With GitButler_ you can apply and unapply (add / remove) any remote branch directly into your working directory.

## Documentation

You can find our end user documentation at: &lt;https://docs.gitbutler.com&gt;

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),
or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## AI Commit Message Generation

Commit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.

Currently, GitButler uses OpenAI&#039;s API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI&#039;s servers.

Our goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

## Sponsorship

Zed is developed by **Zed Industries, Inc.**, a for-profit company.

If you’d like to financially support the project, you can do so via GitHub Sponsors.

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

![Protocol](https://img.shields.io/badge/protocol-ASTP_v1.0-blue)

**ANet** — это инструмент для организации приватного, защищенного информационного пространства между близкими людьми. Мы строим цифровые мосты там, где обычные пути недоступны.

Это не сервис. Это технология для связи тех, кто доверяет друг другу.

## Особенности

В основе проекта лежит собственный транспортный протокол **ASTP (ANet Secure Transport Protocol)**, разработанный с фокусом на:

*   **Приватность:** Полное сквозное шифрование (ChaCha20Poly1305 / X25519).
*   **Устойчивость:** Стабильная работа в сетях с высокими потерями пакетов и нестабильным соединением.
*   **Мимикрия:** Транспортный уровень неотличим от случайного шума (High-entropy UDP stream).
*   **Кроссплатформенность:** Клиенты для Linux, Windows и Android.

## Структура проекта

Проект написан на Rust и разделен на модули:

*   `anet-server` — Узел координации.
*   `anet-client-cli` — Консольный клиент для Linux/Headless систем.
*   `anet-client-gui` — Графический клиент (Windows/Linux) с минималистичным интерфейсом.
*   `anet-mobile` — Библиотека и JNI-биндинги для Android.
*   `anet-common` — Реализация протокола ASTP и криптографии.
*   `anet-keygen` — Утилита для генерации ключей доступа.

## Сборка

Требуется установленный Rust (cargo).

```bash
# Сборка всех компонентов
cargo build --release
```

### Configuration Files

**Claude Code**

- Live config: `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `claude.json`)
- API key field: `env.ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- MCP servers: `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers`

**Codex**

- Live config: `~/.codex/auth.json` (required) + `config.toml` (optional)
- API key field: `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `auth.json`
- MCP servers: `~/.codex/config.toml` → `[mcp_servers]` tables

**Gemini**

- Live config: `~/.gemini/.env` (API key) + `~/.gemini/settings.json` (auth mode)
- API key field: `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Environment variables: Support `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, etc.
- MCP servers: `~/.gemini/settings.json` → `mcpServers`
- Tray quick switch: Each provider switch rewrites `~/.gemini/.env`, no need to restart Gemini CLI

**CC Switch Storage (v3.8.0 New Architecture)**

- Database (SSOT): `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite, stores providers, MCP, Prompts, Skills)
- Local settings: `~/.cc-switch/settings.json` (device-level settings)
- Backups: `~/.cc-switch/backups/` (auto-rotate, keep 10)

### Cloud Sync Setup

1. Go to Settings → &quot;Custom Configuration Directory&quot;
2. Choose your cloud sync folder (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)
3. Restart app to apply
4. Repeat on other devices to enable cross-device sync

&gt; **Note**: First launch auto-imports existing Claude/Codex configs as default provider.

```

**Core Design Patterns**

- **SSOT** (Single Source of Truth): All data stored in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db` (SQLite)
- **Dual-layer Storage**: SQLite for syncable data, JSON for device-level settings
- **Dual-way Sync**: Write to live files on switch, backfill from live when editing active provider
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents config corruption
- **Concurrency Safe**: Mutex-protected database connection avoids race conditions
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation (Commands → Services → DAO → Database)

**Key Components**

- **ProviderService**: Provider CRUD, switching, backfill, sorting
- **McpService**: MCP server management, import/export, live file sync
- **ConfigService**: Config import/export, backup rotation
- **SpeedtestService**: API endpoint latency measurement

**v3.6 Refactoring**

- Backend: 5-phase refactoring (error handling → command split → tests → services → concurrency)
- Frontend: 4-stage refactoring (test infra → hooks → components → cleanup)
- Testing: 100% hooks coverage + integration tests (vitest + MSW)

&lt;/br&gt;If you are looking for the &lt;em&gt;cloud-based agent&lt;/em&gt; from OpenAI, &lt;strong&gt;Codex Web&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/codex&quot;&gt;chatgpt.com/codex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You can also go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest&quot;&gt;latest GitHub Release&lt;/a&gt; and download the appropriate binary for your platform.&lt;/summary&gt;

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what&#039;s included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- ☁️ **Virtual Filesystem**: Remote file management, custom search engines.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

## Why cpx?

`cpx` is a modern replacement for the traditional `cp` command, built with Rust for maximum performance and safety on Linux systems.

![one](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85fdbe39-2635-41b0-a00a-27ba7d2e8e60)

## Features
- 🚀 Fast parallel copying (upto 5x faster than cp [benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md))
- 📊 Beautiful progress bars (customizable)
- ⏸️ Resume interrupted transfers
- 🛑 Graceful Ctrl+C handling with resume hints
  ![four](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11c9ecb8-ea57-4162-9772-bdf071f61848)
- 🎯 Exclude patterns (gitignore-style)
- ⚙️ Flexible configuration

For complete usage examples, see [examples.md](docs/examples.md)

For complete option reference, run `cpx --help`

## Configuration

Set defaults with configuration files:
```bash
# Create config with defaults
cpx config init

# View active configuration
cpx config show

# See config file location
cpx config path
```

**Config locations (in priority order):**
1. `./cpxconfig.toml` (project-level)
2. `~/.config/cpx/cpxconfig.toml` (user-level)
3. `/etc/cpx/cpxconfig.toml` (system-level, Unix only)

**Example config** (`~/.config/cpx/cpxconfig.toml`):
```toml
[exclude]
patterns = [&quot;*.tmp&quot;, &quot;*.log&quot;, &quot;node_modules&quot;, &quot;.git&quot;]

[copy]
parallel = 8
recursive = false

[preserve]
mode = &quot;default&quot;

[progress]
style = &quot;detailed&quot;

[reflink]
mode = &quot;auto&quot;
```

**See [configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for all options and use cases.**

## Performance

`cpx` is built for speed. Quick comparison:

| Task | cp | cpx | speedup |
|------|-----|-------|-----|
| VsCode (~15k files) | 1084ms | 263ms | 4.12x |
| rust (~65k files) | 4.553s | 1.091s  |  4.17x |

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

Zellij includes a built-in [web-client](https://zellij.dev/tutorials/web-client/), making a terminal optional.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

 _The AI-native proxy server and data plane for agentic apps._&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Plano pulls out the rote plumbing work and decouples you from brittle framework abstractions, centralizing what shouldn’t be bespoke in every codebase - like agent routing and orchestration, rich agentic signals and traces for continuous improvement, guardrail filters for safety and moderation, and smart LLM routing APIs for model agility. Use any language or AI framework, and deliver agents faster to production.

# Overview
Building agentic demos is easy. Shipping agentic applications safely, reliably, and repeatably to production is hard. After the thrill of a quick hack, you end up building the “hidden middleware” to reach production: routing logic to reach the right agent, guardrail hooks for safety and moderation, evaluation and observability glue for continuous learning, and model/provider quirks scattered across frameworks and application code.

Plano solves this by moving core delivery concerns into a unified, out-of-process dataplane.

- **🚦 Orchestration:** Low-latency orchestration between agents; add new agents without modifying app code.
- **🔗 Model Agility:** Route [by model name, alias (semantic names) or automatically via preferences](#use-plano-as-a-llm-router).
- **🕵 Agentic Signals&amp;trade;:** Zero-code capture of [Signals](https://docs.planoai.dev/concepts/signals.html) plus OTEL traces/metrics across every agent.
- **🛡️ Moderation &amp; Memory Hooks:** Build jailbreak protection, add moderation policies and memory consistently via [Filter Chains](https://docs.planoai.dev/concepts/filter_chain.html).

Plano pulls rote plumbing out of your framework so you can stay focused on what matters most: the core product logic of your agentic applications. Plano is backed by [industry-leading LLM research](https://planoai.dev/research) and built on [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io) by its core contributors, who built critical infrastructure at scale for modern worklaods.

**Jump to our [docs](https://docs.planoai.dev)** to learn how you can use Plano to improve the speed, safety and obervability of your agentic applications.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Plano and the Arch family of LLMs (like Plano-Orchestrator-4B, Arch-Router, etc) are hosted free of charge in the US-central region to give you a great first-run developer experience of Plano. To scale and run in production, you can either run these LLMs locally or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc) for API keys.

## Build Agentic Apps with Plano

Plano handles **orchestration, model management, and observability** as modular building blocks - letting you configure only what you need (edge proxying for agentic orchestration and guardrails, or LLM routing from your services, or both together) to fit cleanly into existing architectures. Below is a simple multi-agent travel agent built with Plano that showcases all three core capabilities

&gt; 📁 **Full working code:** See [`demos/use_cases/travel_agents/`](demos/use_cases/travel_agents/) for complete weather and flight agents you can run locally.

### 2. Write Simple Agent Code

Your agents are just HTTP servers that implement the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. Use any language or framework:

```python
# weather_agent.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

app = FastAPI()

# Point to Plano&#039;s LLM gateway - it handles model routing for you
llm = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=&quot;http://localhost:12001/v1&quot;, api_key=&quot;EMPTY&quot;)

@app.post(&quot;/v1/chat/completions&quot;)
async def chat(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()
    messages = body.get(&quot;messages&quot;, [])
    days = 7

    # Your agent logic: fetch data, call APIs, run tools
    # See demos/use_cases/travel_agents/ for the full implementation
    weather_data = await get_weather_data(request, messages, days)

    # Stream the response back through Plano
    async def generate():
        stream = await llm.chat.completions.create(
            model=&quot;openai/gpt-4o&quot;,
            messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;Weather: {weather_data}&quot;}, *messages],
            stream=True
        )
        async for chunk in stream:
            yield f&quot;data: {chunk.model_dump_json()}\n\n&quot;

    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type=&quot;text/event-stream&quot;)
```

### 3. Start Plano &amp; Query Your Agents

**Prerequisites:** Follow the [prerequisites guide](https://docs.planoai.dev/get_started/quickstart.html#prerequisites) to install Plano and set up your environment.

```bash
# Start Plano
planoai up config.yaml
...

# Query - Plano intelligently routes to both agents in a single conversation
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    &quot;messages&quot;: [
      {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;I want to travel from NYC to Paris next week. What is the weather like there, and can you find me some flights?&quot;}
    ]
  }&#039;
# → Plano routes to weather_agent for Paris weather ✓
# → Then routes to flight_agent for NYC → Paris flights ✓
# → Returns a complete travel plan with both weather info and flight options
```

### 4. Get Observability and Model Agility for Free

Every request is traced end-to-end with OpenTelemetry - no instrumentation code needed.

### What You Didn&#039;t Have to Build

| Infrastructure Concern | Without Plano | With Plano |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Agent Orchestration** | Write intent classifier + routing logic | Declare agent descriptions in YAML |
| **Model Management** | Handle each provider&#039;s API quirks | Unified LLM APIs with state management |
| **Rich Tracing** | Instrument every service with OTEL | Automatic end-to-end traces and logs |
| **Learning Signals** | Build pipeline to capture/export spans | Zero-code agentic signals |
| **Adding Agents** | Update routing code, test, redeploy | Add to config, restart |

**Why it&#039;s efficient:** Plano uses purpose-built, lightweight LLMs (like our 4B-parameter orchestrator) instead of heavyweight frameworks or GPT-4 for routing - giving you production-grade routing at a fraction of the cost and latency.

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

If you&#039;re an **ALT** user, you can install ripgrep from the
[official repo](https://packages.altlinux.org/en/search?name=ripgrep):

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re a **FreeBSD** user, then you can install ripgrep from the
[official ports](https://www.freshports.org/textproc/ripgrep/):

```
$ sudo pkg install ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re an **OpenBSD** user, then you can install ripgrep from the
[official ports](https://openports.se/textproc/ripgrep):

```
$ doas pkg_add ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re a **NetBSD** user, then you can install ripgrep from
[pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.se/textproc/ripgrep):

```
$ sudo pkgin install ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re a **Haiku x86_64** user, then you can install ripgrep from the
[official ports](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/tree/master/sys-apps/ripgrep):

```
$ sudo pkgman install ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re a **Haiku x86_gcc2** user, then you can install ripgrep from the
same port as Haiku x86_64 using the x86 secondary architecture build:

```
$ sudo pkgman install ripgrep_x86
```

If you&#039;re a **Void Linux** user, then you can install ripgrep from the
[official repository](https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch=x86_64&amp;q=ripgrep):

```
$ sudo xbps-install -Syv ripgrep
```

If you&#039;re a **Rust programmer**, ripgrep can be installed with `cargo`.

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.85.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.85.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your

This is the OpenVAS Scanner of the Greenbone Community Edition.

It is used for the Greenbone Enterprise appliances and is a full-featured
scan engine that executes a continuously updated and extended feed of
Vulnerability Tests (VTs).

## Releases

All [release files](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas/releases) are signed with
the [Greenbone Community Feed integrity key](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gcf-managing-the-digital-signatures/101).
This gpg key can be downloaded at https://www.greenbone.net/GBCommunitySigningKey.asc
and the fingerprint is `8AE4 BE42 9B60 A59B 311C  2E73 9823 FAA6 0ED1 E580`.

## Installation

This module can be configured, built and installed with following commands:

    cmake .
    make install

For detailed installation requirements and instructions, please see the file
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The file also contains instructions for setting up
`openvas` and for making the scanner available to other GVM modules.

If you are not familiar or comfortable building from source code, we recommend
that you use the Greenbone Enterprise TRIAL, a prepared virtual
machine with a readily available setup. Information regarding the virtual machine
is available at &lt;https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow&gt;.

## Rust Implementation

This repository also consists of a [rust project](rust/README.md) aiming to replace the current scanner stack
(openvas-scanner, ospd-openvas, notus-scanner). It simplifies the use of the scanner and centralizes
everything needed for scanning. Currently it uses the openvas-scanner as scan engine.
