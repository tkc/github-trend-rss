            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Servo Parallel Browser Engine Project

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. It is currently developed on
64-bit macOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, 64-bit OpenHarmony, and Android.

Servo welcomes contribution from everyone. Check out:

- The [Servo Book](https://book.servo.org) for documentation
- [servo.org](https://servo.org/) for news and guides

Coordination of Servo development happens:
- Here in the Github Issues
- On the [Servo Zulip](https://servo.zulipchat.com/)
- In video calls advertised in the [Servo Project](https://github.com/servo/project/issues) repo.

## Getting started

For more detailed build instructions, see the Servo book under [Setting up your environment], [Building Servo], [Building for Android] and [Building for OpenHarmony].

[Setting up your environment]: https://book.servo.org/hacking/setting-up-your-environment.html
[Building Servo]: https://book.servo.org/hacking/building-servo.html
[Building for Android]: https://book.servo.org/hacking/building-for-android.html

- Install `uv`: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` 
- Install `rustup`: `curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- Restart your shell to make sure `cargo` is available
- Install the other dependencies: `./mach bootstrap`
- Build servoshell: `./mach build`

### Linux

- Install `curl`:
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S --needed curl`
  - Debian, Ubuntu: `sudo apt install curl`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install curl`

  ```
- Follow the instructions above for the platform you are building on

### OpenHarmony

- Follow the instructions above for the platform you are building on to prepare the environment.
- Depending on the target distribution (e.g. `HarmonyOS NEXT` vs pure `OpenHarmony`) the build configuration will differ slightly.
- Ensure that the following environment variables are set
  - `DEVECO_SDK_HOME` (Required when targeting `HarmonyOS NEXT`)
  - `OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME` (Required when targeting `OpenHarmony`)
  - `OHOS_SDK_NATIVE` (e.g. `${DEVECO_SDK_HOME}/default/openharmony/native` or `${OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME}/${API_VERSION}/native`)
  - `SERVO_OHOS_SIGNING_CONFIG`: Path to json file containing a valid signing configuration for the demo app.
- Review the detailed instructions at [Building for OpenHarmony].
- The target distribution can be modified by passing `--flavor=&lt;default|harmonyos&gt;` to `mach &lt;build|package|install&gt;`.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## What is [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com)?

You can think of SpacetimeDB as both a database and server combined into one.

It is a relational database system that lets you upload your application logic directly into the database by way of fancy stored procedures called &quot;modules.&quot;

Instead of deploying a web or game server that sits in between your clients and your database, your clients connect directly to the database and execute your application logic inside the database itself. You can write all of your permission and authorization logic right inside your module just as you would in a normal server.

This means that you can write your entire application in a single language, Rust, and deploy it as a single binary. No more microservices, no more containers, no more Kubernetes, no more Docker, no more VMs, no more DevOps, no more infrastructure, no more ops, no more servers.

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/basic-architecture-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;SpacetimeDB Architecture&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpacetimeDB application architecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(elements in white are provided by SpacetimeDB)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

It&#039;s actually similar to the idea of smart contracts, except that SpacetimeDB is a database, has nothing to do with blockchain, and is orders of magnitude faster than any smart contract system.

So fast, in fact, that the entire backend of our MMORPG [BitCraft Online](https://bitcraftonline.com) is just a SpacetimeDB module. We don&#039;t have any other servers or services running, which means that everything in the game, all of the chat messages, items, resources, terrain, and even the locations of the players are stored and processed by the database before being synchronized out to all of the clients in real-time.

SpacetimeDB is optimized for maximum speed and minimum latency rather than batch processing or OLAP workloads. It is designed to be used for real-time applications like games, chat, and collaboration tools.

This speed and latency is achieved by holding all of application state in memory, while persisting the data in a write-ahead-log (WAL) which is used to recover application state.

## Installation

You can run SpacetimeDB as a standalone database server via the `spacetime` CLI tool.
Install instructions for supported platforms are outlined below.
The same install instructions can be found on our website at https://spacetimedb.com/install.

#### Install on macOS

Installing on macOS is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Linux

Installing on Linux is as simple as running our install script. After that you can use the spacetime command to manage versions.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Windows

Installing on Windows is as simple as pasting the above snippet into PowerShell. If you would like to use WSL instead, please follow the Linux install instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.spacetimedb.com -useb | iex
```

#### Installing from Source

A quick note on installing from source: we recommend that you don&#039;t install from source unless there is a feature that is available in `master` that hasn&#039;t been released yet, otherwise follow the official installation instructions.

##### MacOS + Linux

Installing on macOS + Linux is pretty straightforward. First we are going to build all of the binaries that we need:

```bash
# Install rustup, you can skip this step if you have cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target already installed.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/.local/bin/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/.local/share/spacetime/bin/$STDB_VERSION
```

At this stage you&#039;ll need to add ~/.local/bin to your path if you haven&#039;t already.

```
# Please add the following line to your shell configuration and open a new shell session:
export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;

```

Then finally set your SpacetimeDB version:
```

# Then, in a new shell, set the current version:
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION

# If STDB_VERSION is not set anymore then you can use the following command to list your versions:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

##### Windows

Building on windows is a bit more complicated. You&#039;ll need a slightly different version of perl compared to what comes pre-bundled in most Windows terminals. We recommend [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). You may also need access to an `openssl` binary which actually comes pre-installed with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Also, you&#039;ll need to install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for Windows.

In a Git for Windows shell you should have something that looks like this:
```
$ which perl
/c/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl
$ which openssl
/mingw64/bin/openssl
$ which cargo 
/c/Users/&lt;user&gt;/.cargo/bin/cargo
```

If that looks correct then you&#039;re ready to proceed!

```powershell
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB

# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
$stdbDir = &quot;$HOME\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB&quot;
$stdbVersion = &amp; &quot;.\target\release\spacetimedb-cli&quot; --version | Select-String -Pattern &#039;spacetimedb tool version ([0-9.]+);&#039; | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion&quot; -Force | Out-Null

# Install the update binary
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-update.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\spacetime.exe&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-cli.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;
Copy-Item &quot;target\release\spacetimedb-standalone.exe&quot; &quot;$stdbDir\bin\$stdbVersion\&quot;

```

Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB
```

Then finally, open a new shell and use the installed SpacetimeDB version:
```
spacetime version use $stdbVersion

# If stdbVersion is no longer set, list versions using the following command:
spacetime version list
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

If you&#039;re using Git for Windows you can follow these instructions instead:

```bash
# Clone SpacetimeDB
git clone https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB
# Build and install the CLI
cd SpacetimeDB
# Build the CLI binaries - this takes a while on windows so go grab a coffee :)
cargo build --locked --release -p spacetimedb-standalone -p spacetimedb-update -p spacetimedb-cli

# Create directories
export STDB_VERSION=&quot;$(./target/release/spacetimedb-cli --version | sed -n &#039;s/.*spacetimedb tool version \([0-9.]*\);.*/\1/p&#039;)&quot;
mkdir -p ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Install the update binary
cp target/release/spacetimedb-update ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/spacetime
cp target/release/spacetimedb-cli ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION
cp target/release/spacetimedb-standalone ~/AppData/Local/SpacetimeDB/bin/$STDB_VERSION

# Now add the directory we just created to your path. We recommend adding it to the system path because then it will be available to all of your applications (including Unity3D). After you do this, restart your shell!
# %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\SpacetimeDB

# Set the current version
spacetime version use $STDB_VERSION
```

You can verify that the correct version has been installed via `spacetime --version`.

#### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run Spacetime in a container, you can use the following command to start a new instance.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 3000:3000 clockworklabs/spacetime start
```

## Documentation

For more information about SpacetimeDB, getting started guides, game development guides, and reference material please see our [documentation](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

## Getting Started

We&#039;ve prepared several getting started guides in each of our supported languages to help you get up and running with SpacetimeDB as quickly as possible. You can find them on our [docs page](https://spacetimedb.com/docs).

In summary there are only 4 steps to getting started with SpacetimeDB.

1. Install the `spacetime` CLI tool.
2. Start a SpacetimeDB standalone node with `spacetime start`.
3. Write and upload a module in one of our supported module languages.
4. Connect to the database with one of our client libraries.

You can see a summary of the supported languages below with a link to the getting started guide for each.

## Language Support

You can write SpacetimeDB modules in several popular languages, with more to come in the future!

#### Serverside Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/c-sharp/quickstart)

#### Client Libraries

- [Rust](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/rust/quickstart)
- [C#](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/c-sharp/quickstart)
- [Typescript](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart)

## License

SpacetimeDB is licensed under the BSL 1.1 license. This is not an open source or free software license, however, it converts to the AGPL v3.0 license with a linking exception after a few years.

Note that the AGPL v3.0 does not typically include a linking exception. We have added a custom linking exception to the AGPL license for SpacetimeDB. Our motivation for choosing a free software license is to ensure that contributions made to SpacetimeDB are propagated back to the community. We are expressly not interested in forcing users of SpacetimeDB to open source their own code if they link with SpacetimeDB, so we needed to include a linking exception.

## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS &amp; iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri&#039;s features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn&#039;t create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

### Platforms

Tauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tokio

A runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications with
the Rust programming language. It is:

* **Fast**: Tokio&#039;s zero-cost abstractions give you bare-metal
  performance.

* **Reliable**: Tokio leverages Rust&#039;s ownership, type system, and
  concurrency model to reduce bugs and ensure thread safety.

* **Scalable**: Tokio has a minimal footprint, and handles backpressure
  and cancellation naturally.

## Overview

Tokio is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O platform for writing
asynchronous applications with the Rust programming language. At a high
level, it provides a few major components:

* A multithreaded, work-stealing based task [scheduler].
* A reactor backed by the operating system&#039;s event queue (epoll, kqueue,
  IOCP, etc.).
* Asynchronous [TCP and UDP][net] sockets.

These components provide the runtime components necessary for building
an asynchronous application.

[net]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html
[scheduler]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html

## Example

A basic TCP echo server with Tokio.

Make sure you activated the full features of the tokio crate on Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = &quot;1.48.0&quot;, features = [&quot;full&quot;] }
```
Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run
use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&amp;mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(0) =&gt; return,
                    Ok(n) =&gt; n,
                    Err(e) =&gt; {
                        eprintln!(&quot;failed to read from socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&amp;buf[0..n]).await {
                    eprintln!(&quot;failed to write to socket; err = {:?}&quot;, e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## Supported Rust Versions

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- README.md
- tokio/README.md
- tokio/Cargo.toml
- tokio-util/Cargo.toml
- tokio-test/Cargo.toml
- tokio-stream/Cargo.toml
--&gt;

Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.71.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release. The MSRV history for past minor releases can be found below:

 * 1.48 to now  - Rust 1.71
 * 1.39 to 1.47 - Rust 1.70
 * 1.30 to 1.38 - Rust 1.63
 * 1.27 to 1.29 - Rust 1.56
 * 1.17 to 1.26 - Rust 1.49
 * 1.15 to 1.16 - Rust 1.46
 * 1.0 to 1.14 - Rust 1.45

Note that although we try to avoid the situation where a dependency transitively
increases the MSRV of Tokio, we do not guarantee that this does not happen.
However, every minor release will have some set of versions of dependencies that
works with the MSRV of that minor release.

## Release schedule

Tokio doesn&#039;t follow a fixed release schedule, but we typically make one minor
release each month. We make patch releases for bugfixes as necessary.

## Bug patching policy

For the purposes of making patch releases with bugfixes, we have designated
certain minor releases as LTS (long term support) releases. Whenever a bug
warrants a patch release with a fix for the bug, it will be backported and
released as a new patch release for each LTS minor version. Our current LTS
releases are:

 * `1.43.x` - LTS release until March 2026. (MSRV 1.70)
 * `1.47.x` - LTS release until September 2026. (MSRV 1.70)

Each LTS release will continue to receive backported fixes for at least a year.
If you wish to use a fixed minor release in your project, we recommend that you
use an LTS release.

To use a fixed minor version, you can specify the version with a tilde. For
example, to specify that you wish to use the newest `1.43.x` patch release, you
can use the following dependency specification:
```text
tokio = { version = &quot;~1.43&quot;, features = [...] }
```

### Previous LTS releases

 * `1.8.x` - LTS release until February 2022.
 * `1.14.x` - LTS release until June 2022.
 * `1.18.x` - LTS release until June 2023.
 * `1.20.x` - LTS release until September 2023.
 * `1.25.x` - LTS release until March 2024.
 * `1.32.x` - LTS release until September 2024.
 * `1.36.x` - LTS release until March 2025.
 * `1.38.x` - LTS release until July 2025.

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## ⚡️ Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

&lt;p float=&quot;left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ⚡️ Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

## ⌨️ Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

We have optimized Rust compilation speed to ensure developing your own Oxc-based tools remains efficient.
Our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain) complete in approximately 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

## 🎯 Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### 🔸 AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling, any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.

#### 🏆 Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

### 🔸 Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### 🏆 Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

### 🔸 Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### 🔸 Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript, React, ES6 transforms are complete.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### 🔸 Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indicates that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### 🔸 Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

See [minification benchmarks](https://github.com/privatenumber/minification-benchmarks) for comparisons.

### 🔸 Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

## 🧪Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What Can I Do with Hyperswitch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a modular, open-source payments infrastructure designed for flexibility and control. Apart from our Payment Suite offering, this solution allows businesses to pick and integrate only the modules they need on top of their existing payment stack — without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.

Each module is independent and purpose-built to optimize different aspects of payment processing.

## Quickstart 

&lt;h3&gt; Local Setup via Docker &lt;/h3&gt;

```bash
# One-click local setup

git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch

cd hyperswitch

scripts/setup.sh
```
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This script: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Detects Docker/Podman  
  - Offers multiple deployment profiles:
    - **Standard**: App server + Control Center  
    - **Full**: Includes monitoring + schedulers  
    - **Minimal**: Standalone App server  
  - Provides access links when done

  If you need further help, check out our [video tutorial](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/overview/unified-local-setup-using-docker).  

  👉 After setup, [configure a connector](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/using-hyperswitch-control-center#add-a-payment-processor) and [test a payment](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/test-a-payment).
&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Hosted Sandbox (No Setup Required)&lt;/h3&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a fully hosted sandbox environment that requires no setup. You can explore the Control Center, configure payment connectors, and test payments directly from the UI.

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.hyperswitch.io&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What you can do in the Hosted Sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Access the full Control Center  
  - Configure payment connectors  
  - View logs, routing rules, and retry strategies  
  - Try payments directly from the UI

## Why Hyperswitch?

Hyperswitch is a commercial open-source payments stack purpose-built for scale, flexibility, and developer experience. Designed with a modular architecture, Hyperswitch lets you pick only the components you need—whether it’s routing, retries, vaulting, or observability—without vendor lock-in or bloated integrations.

Built in Rust for performance and reliability, Hyperswitch supports global payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, UPI, Pay by Bank), exposes smart routing and retry logic, and provides a visual workflow builder in the Control Center. Whether you&#039;re integrating a full payment suite or augmenting an existing stack with a single module, Hyperswitch meets you where you are.

&lt;strong&gt;“Linux for Payments”&lt;/strong&gt; — Hyperswitch is a well-architected reference for teams who want to own their payments stack.

We believe in:

- &lt;strong&gt; Embracing Payment Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; Innovation comes from enabling choice—across payment methods, processors, and flows.

- &lt;strong&gt; Open Source by Default:&lt;/strong&gt; Transparency drives trust and builds better, reusable software.

- &lt;strong&gt; Community-Driven Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Our roadmap is shaped by real-world use cases and contributors. 

- &lt;strong&gt; Systems-Level Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; We hold ourselves to a high bar for reliability, security, and performance.

- &lt;strong&gt; Maximizing Value Creation:&lt;/strong&gt; For developers, customers, and partners alike.

- &lt;strong&gt; Community-Driven, Enterprise-Tested:&lt;/strong&gt; Hyperswitch is built in the open with real-world feedback from developers and contributors, and maintained by Juspay, the team powering payment infrastructure for 400+ leading enterprises worldwide.

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

### Syntax highlighting

`bat` supports syntax highlighting for a large number of programming and markup
languages:

![Syntax highlighting example](https://imgur.com/rGsdnDe.png)

### Git integration

`bat` communicates with `git` to show modifications with respect to the index
(see left side bar):

![Git integration example](https://i.imgur.com/2lSW4RE.png)

### Show non-printable characters

You can use the `-A`/`--show-all` option to show and highlight non-printable
characters:

![Non-printable character example](https://i.imgur.com/WndGp9H.png)

### Automatic paging

By default, `bat` pipes its own output to a pager (e.g. `less`) if the output is too large for one screen.
If you would rather `bat` work like `cat` all the time (never page output), you can set `--paging=never` as an option, either on the command line or in your configuration file.
If you intend to alias `cat` to `bat` in your shell configuration, you can use `alias cat=&#039;bat --paging=never&#039;` to preserve the default behavior.

#### File concatenation

Even with a pager set, you can still use `bat` to concatenate files :wink:.
Whenever `bat` detects a non-interactive terminal (i.e. when you pipe into another process or into a file), `bat` will act as a drop-in replacement for `cat` and fall back to printing the plain file contents, regardless of the `--pager` option&#039;s value.

## How to use

Display a single file on the terminal

```bash
bat README.md
```

Display multiple files at once

```bash
bat src/*.rs
```

Read from stdin, determine the syntax automatically (note, highlighting will
only work if the syntax can be determined from the first line of the file,
usually through a shebang such as `#!/bin/sh`)

```bash
curl -s https://sh.rustup.rs | bat
```

Read from stdin, specify the language explicitly

```bash
yaml2json .travis.yml | json_pp | bat -l json
```

Show and highlight non-printable characters:
```bash
bat -A /etc/hosts
```

Use it as a `cat` replacement:

```bash
bat &gt; note.md  # quickly create a new file

bat header.md content.md footer.md &gt; document.md

bat -n main.rs  # show line numbers (only)

bat f - g  # output &#039;f&#039;, then stdin, then &#039;g&#039;.
```

### Integration with other tools

#### `fzf`

You can use `bat` as a previewer for [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). To do this,
use `bat`&#039;s `--color=always` option to force colorized output. You can also use `--line-range`
option to restrict the load times for long files:

```bash
fzf --preview &quot;bat --color=always --style=numbers --line-range=:500 {}&quot;
```

For more information, see [`fzf`&#039;s `README`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window).

#### `find` or `fd`

You can use the `-exec` option of `find` to preview all search results with `bat`:

```bash
find … -exec bat {} +
```

If you happen to use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), you can use the `-X`/`--exec-batch` option to do the same:

```bash
fd … -X bat
```

#### `ripgrep`

With [`batgrep`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batgrep.md), `bat` can be used as the printer for [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search results.

```bash
batgrep needle src/
```

#### `tail -f`

`bat` can be combined with `tail -f` to continuously monitor a given file with syntax highlighting.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/pacman.log | bat --paging=never -l log
```

Note that we have to switch off paging in order for this to work. We have also specified the syntax
explicitly (`-l log`), as it can not be auto-detected in this case.

#### `git`

You can combine `bat` with `git show` to view an older version of a given file with proper syntax
highlighting:

```bash
git show v0.6.0:src/main.rs | bat -l rs
```

#### `git diff`

You can combine `bat` with `git diff` to view lines around code changes with proper syntax
highlighting:
```bash
batdiff() {
    git diff --name-only --relative --diff-filter=d -z | xargs -0 bat --diff
}
```
If you prefer to use this as a separate tool, check out `batdiff` in [`bat-extras`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras).

If you are looking for more support for git and diff operations, check out [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).

#### `xclip`

The line numbers and Git modification markers in the output of `bat` can make it hard to copy
the contents of a file. To prevent this, you can call `bat` with the `-p`/`--plain` option or
simply pipe the output into `xclip`:
```bash
bat main.cpp | xclip
```
`bat` will detect that the output is being redirected and print the plain file contents.

#### `man`

`bat` can be used as a colorizing pager for `man`, by setting the
`MANPAGER` environment variable:

```bash
export MANPAGER=&quot;sh -c &#039;awk &#039;\&#039;&#039;{ gsub(/\x1B\[[0-9;]*m/, \&quot;\&quot;, \$0); gsub(/.\x08/, \&quot;\&quot;, \$0); print }&#039;\&#039;&#039; | bat -p -lman&#039;&quot;
man 2 select
```
(replace `bat` with `batcat` if you are on Debian or Ubuntu)

If you prefer to have this bundled in a new command, you can also use [`batman`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batman.md).

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; This will [not work](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1145) out of the box with Mandoc&#039;s `man` implementation.
&gt;
&gt; Please either use `batman`, or convert the shell script to a [shebang executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) and point `MANPAGER` to that.

Note that the [Manpage syntax](assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/Manpage.sublime-syntax) is developed in this repository and still needs some work.

#### `prettier` / `shfmt` / `rustfmt`

The [`prettybat`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/prettybat.md) script is a wrapper that will format code and print it with `bat`.

#### `Warp`

&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.warp.dev/drive/folder/-Bat-Warp-Pack-lxhe7HrEwgwpG17mvrFSz1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;doc/sponsors/warp-pack-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;Warp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

#### Highlighting `--help` messages

You can use `bat` to colorize help text: `$ cp --help | bat -plhelp`

You can also use a wrapper around this:

```bash
# in your .bashrc/.zshrc/*rc
alias bathelp=&#039;bat --plain --language=help&#039;
help() {
    &quot;$@&quot; --help 2&gt;&amp;1 | bathelp
}
```

Then you can do `$ help cp` or `$ help git commit`.

When you are using `zsh`, you can also use global aliases to override `-h` and `--help` entirely:

```bash
alias -g -- -h=&#039;-h 2&gt;&amp;1 | bat --language=help --style=plain&#039;
alias -g -- --help=&#039;--help 2&gt;&amp;1 | bat --language=help --style=plain&#039;
```

For `fish`, you can use abbreviations:

```fish
abbr -a --position anywhere -- --help &#039;--help | bat -plhelp&#039;
abbr -a --position anywhere -- -h &#039;-h | bat -plhelp&#039;
```

This way, you can keep on using `cp --help`, but get colorized help pages.

Be aware that in some cases, `-h` may not be a shorthand of `--help` (for example with `ls`). In cases where you need to use `-h` 
as a command argument you can prepend `\` to the argument (eg. `ls \-h`) to escape the aliasing defined above. 

Please report any issues with the help syntax in [this repository](https://github.com/victor-gp/cmd-help-sublime-syntax).


## Installation

&lt;!--

Installation instructions need to:
* be for widely used systems
* be non-obvious
* be from somewhat official sources

--&gt;

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/bat-cat.svg?columns=3&amp;exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/bat-cat/versions)

### On Ubuntu (using `apt`)
*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*

`bat` is available on [Ubuntu since 20.04 (&quot;Focal&quot;)](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=bat&amp;exact=1) and [Debian since August 2021 (Debian 11 - &quot;Bullseye&quot;)](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/bat).

If your Ubuntu/Debian installation is new enough you can simply run:

```bash
sudo apt install bat
```

**Important**: If you install `bat` this way, please note that the executable may be installed as `batcat` instead of `bat` (due to [a name
clash with another package](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/982)). You can set up a `bat -&gt; batcat` symlink or alias to prevent any issues that may come up because of this and to be consistent with other distributions:
``` bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s /usr/bin/batcat ~/.local/bin/bat
```

an example alias for `batcat` as `bat`:
```bash
alias bat=&quot;batcat&quot;
```

take a look at the [&quot;Using `bat` on Windows&quot;](#using-bat-on-windows) section.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)

#### With WinGet

You can install `bat` via [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget):

```bash
choco install bat
```

#### With Scoop

You can install `bat` via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):
```bash
scoop install bat
```

#### From prebuilt binaries:

You can download prebuilt binaries from the [Release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases),

You will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) package.

### From binaries

Check out the [Release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases) for
prebuilt versions of `bat` for many different architectures. Statically-linked
binaries are also available: look for archives with `musl` in the file name.

### From source

If you want to build `bat` from source, you need Rust 1.79.0 or
higher. You can then use `cargo` to build everything:

#### From local source
```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
```
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The `--path .` above specifies the directory of the source code and NOT where `bat` will be installed.
&gt; For more information see the docs for [`cargo install`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html).

#### From `crates.io`
```bash
cargo install --locked bat
```

Note that additional files like the man page or shell completion
files can not be installed automatically in both these ways.
If installing from a local source, they will be generated by `cargo`
and should be available in the cargo target folder under `build`.

Furthermore, shell completions are also available by running:
```bash
bat --completion &lt;shell&gt;
# see --help for supported shells
```

## Customization

### Highlighting theme

Use `bat --list-themes` to get a list of all available themes for syntax
highlighting. By default, `bat` uses `Monokai Extended` or `Monokai Extended Light`
for dark and light themes respectively. To select the `TwoDark` theme, call `bat`
with the `--theme=TwoDark` option or set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to
`TwoDark`. Use `export BAT_THEME=&quot;TwoDark&quot;` in your shell&#039;s startup file to
make the change permanent. Alternatively, use `bat`&#039;s
[configuration file](#configuration-file).

If you want to preview the different themes on a custom file, you can use
the following command (you need [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for this):
```bash
bat --list-themes | fzf --preview=&quot;bat --theme={} --color=always /path/to/file&quot;
```

`bat` automatically picks a fitting theme depending on your terminal&#039;s background color.
You can use the `--theme-dark` / `--theme-light` options or the `BAT_THEME_DARK` / `BAT_THEME_LIGHT` environment variables
to customize the themes used. This is especially useful if you frequently switch between dark and light mode.

You can also use a custom theme by following the
[&#039;Adding new themes&#039; section below](#adding-new-themes).

### 8-bit themes

`bat` has three themes that always use [8-bit colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors),
even when truecolor support is available:

- `ansi` looks decent on any terminal. It uses 3-bit colors: black, red, green,
  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
- `base16` is designed for [base16](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home) terminal themes. It uses
  4-bit colors (3-bit colors plus bright variants) in accordance with the
  [base16 styling guidelines](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home/blob/main/styling.md).
- `base16-256` is designed for [tinted-shell](https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-shell).
  It replaces certain bright colors with 8-bit colors from 16 to 21. **Do not** use this simply
  because you have a 256-color terminal but are not using tinted-shell.

Although these themes are more restricted, they have three advantages over truecolor themes. They:

- Enjoy maximum compatibility. Some terminal utilities do not support more than 3-bit colors.
- Adapt to terminal theme changes. Even for already printed output.
- Visually harmonize better with other terminal software.

### Output style

You can use the `--style` option to control the appearance of `bat`&#039;s output.
You can use `--style=numbers,changes`, for example, to show only Git changes
and line numbers but no grid and no file header. Set the `BAT_STYLE` environment
variable to make these changes permanent or use `bat`&#039;s
[configuration file](#configuration-file).

&gt;[!tip]
&gt; If you specify a default style in `bat`&#039;s config file, you can change which components
&gt; are displayed during a single run of `bat` using the `--style` command-line argument.
&gt; By prefixing a component with `+` or `-`, it can be added or removed from the current style.
&gt;
&gt; For example, if your config contains `--style=full,-snip`, you can run bat with
&gt; `--style=-grid,+snip` to remove the grid and add back the `snip` component.
&gt; Or, if you want to override the styles completely, you use `--style=numbers` to
&gt; only show the line numbers.

### Adding new syntaxes / language definitions

Should you find that a particular syntax is not available within `bat`, you can follow these
instructions to easily add new syntaxes to your current `bat` installation.

`bat` uses the excellent [`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/)
library for syntax highlighting. `syntect` can read any
[Sublime Text `.sublime-syntax` file](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)
and theme.

A good resource for finding Sublime Syntax packages is [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Once you found a
syntax:

1. Create a folder with syntax definition files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes&quot;
   cd &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes&quot;

   # Put new &#039;.sublime-syntax&#039; language definition files
   # in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:
   git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax
   ```

2. Now use the following command to parse these files into a binary cache:

   ```bash
   bat cache --build
   ```

3. Finally, use `bat --list-languages` to check if the new languages are available.

   If you ever want to go back to the default settings, call:

   ```bash
   bat cache --clear
   ```

4. If you think that a specific syntax should be included in `bat` by default, please
   consider opening a &quot;syntax request&quot; ticket after reading the policies and
   instructions [here](doc/assets.md): [Open Syntax Request](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/new?labels=syntax-request&amp;template=syntax_request.md).

### Adding new themes

This works very similar to how we add new syntax definitions.
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Themes are stored in [`.tmTheme` files](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/color_schemes_tmtheme.html).

First, create a folder with the new syntax highlighting themes:
```bash
mkdir -p &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/themes&quot;
cd &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/themes&quot;

# Download a theme in &#039;.tmTheme&#039; format, for example:
git clone https://github.com/greggb/sublime-snazzy

# Update the binary cache
bat cache --build
```

Finally, use `bat --list-themes` to check if the new themes are available.
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; `bat` uses the name of the `.tmTheme` file for the theme&#039;s name. 

### Adding or changing file type associations

You can add new (or change existing) file name patterns using the `--map-syntax`
command line option. The option takes an argument of the form `pattern:syntax` where

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you&#039;re new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial] or
[Breezy], or hybrid systems like Google&#039;s cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC].

[Mercurial]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/
[Breezy]: https://www.breezy-vcs.org/
[Piper/CitC]: https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it **compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!**
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- **Git**: We make an effort to [be fast][perf]—with a snappy UX, efficient
  algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
  detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for &quot;physical
  storage&quot;, for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- **Mercurial &amp; Sapling**: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
  the [revset] language to select commits. There is [no explicit index][no-index]
  or staging area. Branches are &quot;anonymous&quot; like Mercurial, so you don&#039;t need
  to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
  powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
  that can be configured by the user.

- **Darcs**: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as [first-class
  objects][conflicts] in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
  are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
  While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
  theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
  conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

[perf]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49
[revset]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/
[no-index]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index
[conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- **Working-copy-as-a-commit**: Changes to files are [recorded automatically][wcc]
  as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This &quot;snapshot&quot;
  design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
  object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
  Git&#039;s stashes or the index/staging-area.

- **Operation log &amp; undo**: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
  repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
  &quot;what just happened?&quot; or &quot;how did I end up here?&quot; easier, *especially* when
  you&#039;re helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
  And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
  with ease. Version control has finally entered [the 1960s][undo-history]!

- **Automatic rebase and conflict resolution**: When you modify a commit, every
  descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
  makes &quot;patch-based&quot; workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
  the _resolution_ of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
  well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of `git rebase
  --update-refs` combined with `git rerere`, supported by design.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
&gt; bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!

- **Safe, concurrent replication**: Have you ever wanted to store your version
  controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
  repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!

  The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
  like `rsync` on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
  on *local filesystem operations* being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
  with respect to other reads and writes—which is _not_ true when operating on
  distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
  backup) happen while lock files are being held.

  Jujutsu is instead designed to be [safe under concurrent scenarios][conc-safety];
  simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
  should never result in a repository in a *corrupt state*. The worst that
  _should_ happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
  state, leaving you to resolve them.

[undo-history]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History
[conc-safety]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/

The command-line tool is called `jj` for now because it&#039;s easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called &quot;Jujutsu&quot; because it matches
&quot;jj&quot;.

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

these channels[^bridge].

[^bridge]: To be more precise, the `#jujutsu` Libera IRC channel is bridged to
one of the channels on jj&#039;s Discord. Some of the developers stay on Discord and

## Getting started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Jujutsu is an **experimental version control system**. While Git compatibility
&gt; is stable, and most developers use it daily for all their needs, there may
&gt; still be work-in-progress features, suboptimal UX, and workflow gaps that make
&gt; it unusable for your particular use.

Follow the [installation
instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup) to
obtain and configure `jj`.

The best way to get started is probably to go through [the
tutorial](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial). Also see the [Git
comparison](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison), which
includes a table of `jj` vs. `git` commands.

As you become more familiar with Jujutsu, the following resources may be helpful:

- The [FAQ](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/FAQ).
- The [Glossary](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary).
- The `jj help` command (e.g. `jj help rebase`).
- The `jj help -k &lt;keyword&gt;` command (e.g. `jj help -k config`). Use `jj help --help`
  to see what keywords are available.

If you are using a **prerelease** version of `jj`, you would want to consult
[the docs for the prerelease (main branch)
version](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/). You can also get there
from the docs for the latest release by using the website&#039;s version switcher. The version switcher is visible in
the header of the website when you scroll to the top of any page.

## Features

### Compatible with Git

Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, only the Git backend is production-ready. The Git backend uses the
[gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) Rust library.

[backends]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend

The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.

Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with `jj`.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/git_compat.png&quot; /&gt;

You can even have a [colocated local
repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#colocated-jujutsugit-repos)
where you can use both `jj` and `git` commands interchangeably.

### The working copy is automatically committed

Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.

The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no &quot;error: Your local changes to the following
files...&quot;), and there is no need for `git stash`. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you&#039;re done with the
changes.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/working_copy.png&quot; /&gt;

### The repo is the source of truth

With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, `jj restore` (similar to `git restore`) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and `jj describe` can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).

### Entire repo is under version control

All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily restore to
an earlier repo state, simply undo your operations one-by-one or even _revert_ a
particular operation which does not have to be the most recent one.

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/operation_log.png&quot; /&gt;

### Conflicts can be recorded in commits

If an operation results in
[conflicts](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict),
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there&#039;s no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).

Basic conflict resolution:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/resolve_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

Juggling conflicts:

&lt;img src=&quot;demos/juggle_conflicts.png&quot; /&gt;

### Automatic rebase

Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.

### Comprehensive support for rewriting history

Besides the usual rebase command, there&#039;s `jj describe` for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There&#039;s also `jj diffedit`,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use `jj split`. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using `jj squash -i --from X --into Y`.

## Status

The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It&#039;s likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.

Today, all core developers use `jj` to work on `jj`. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used `jj` to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven&#039;t had to re-clone from source (I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even had
to restore from backup).

There *will* be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. For any format changes, we&#039;ll try to
implement transparent upgrades (as we&#039;ve done with recent changes), or provide
upgrade commands or scripts if requested.

## Related work

There are several tools trying to solve similar problems as Jujutsu. See
[related work](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/related-work) for details.

## Contributing

We welcome outside contributions, and there&#039;s plenty of things to do, so
don&#039;t be shy. Please ask if you want a pointer on something you can help with,
and hopefully we can all figure something out.

We do have [a few policies and
suggestions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/prerelease/contributing/)
for contributors. The broad TL;DR:

- Bug reports are very welcome!
- Every commit that lands in the `main` branch is code reviewed.
- Please behave yourself, and obey the Community Guidelines.
- There **is** a mandatory CLA you must agree to. Importantly, it **does not**
  transfer copyright ownership to Google or anyone else; it simply gives us the
  right to safely redistribute and use your changes.

### Mandatory Google Disclaimer

I (Martin von Zweigbergk, &lt;martinvonz@google.com&gt;) started Jujutsu as a hobby
project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google,
with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities.
That said, **this is not a Google product**.

**Slint** is an open-source declarative GUI toolkit for building native user interfaces for embedded systems, desktops, and mobile platforms.

Write your UI once in `.slint`, a simple markup language. Connect it to business logic written in Rust, C++, JavaScript, or Python.

## Why Slint?

The name *Slint* is derived from our design goals:

- **Scalable**: Slint should support responsive UI design, allow cross-platform
    usage across operating systems and processor architectures and support
    multiple programming languages.
- **Lightweight**: Slint should require minimal resources, in terms of memory
    and processing power, and yet deliver a smooth, smartphone-like user
    experience on any device.
- **Intuitive**: Designers and developers should feel productive while enjoying
    the GUI design and development process. The design creation tools should be
    intuitive to use for the designers. Similarly for the developers, the APIs
    should be consistent and easy to use, no matter which programming language
    they choose.
- **Native**: GUI built with Slint should match the end users&#039; expectations of a
    native application irrespective of the platform - desktop, mobile, web or
    embedded system. The UI design should be compiled to machine code and provide
    flexibility that only a native application can offer: Access full operating
    system APIs, utilize all CPU and GPU cores, connect to any peripheral.

Beyond the design goals, here’s what makes Slint stand out:

- **Independent UI Design**: Use a declarative language similar to separate your UI from business logic. Designers can work in parallel with developers.
- **Tooling**: Iterate quickly with our Live Preview &amp; editor integrations. Integrate from Figma with the [Figma to Slint plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint).
- **Stable APIs**: Slint follows a stable 1.x API. We evolve carefully without breaking your code.

## Get Started

### Hello World

The UI is defined in a Domain Specific Language that is declarative, easy to use,
intuitive, and provides a powerful way to describe graphical elements, their
placement, their hierarchy, property bindings, and the flow of data through the
different states.

Here&#039;s the obligatory &quot;Hello World&quot;:

```slint
export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

### Documentation

For more details, check out the [Slint Language Documentation](https://slint.dev/docs/slint).

The [examples](examples) folder contains examples and demos, showing how to
use the Slint markup language and how to interact with a Slint user interface
from supported programming languages.

The `docs` folder contains a lot more information, including
[build instructions](docs/building.md), and
[internal developer docs](docs/development.md).

Refer to the README of each language directory in the `api` folder:

- [C++](api/cpp) ([Documentation][#15] | [Getting Started Template][#17])
- [Rust](api/rs/slint) [![Crates.io][#18]][#19] ([Documentation][#20] | [Tutorial Video][#22] | [Getting Started Template][#23])
- [JavaScript/NodeJS (Beta)](api/node) [![npm][#24]][#25] ([Documentation][#26] | [Getting Started Template][#28])
- [Python (Beta)](api/python/slint) [![pypi][#31]][#32] ([Documentation][#33] | [Getting Started Template][#34])

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or
JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which is compiled to
native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint.dev/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint`
are pure functions that the compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler
could choose to &quot;inline&quot; properties and remove those that are constant or
unchanged.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization,
and finally code generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation
in the target language. The C++ code generator produces a C++ header file, the
Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter for dynamic
languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in
the `.slint` language. Components with their elements, items, and properties are
laid out in a single memory region, to reduce memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time:

- The `femtovg` renderer uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
- The `skia` renderer uses [Skia](https://skia.org) for rendering.
- The `software` renderer uses the CPU with no additional dependencies.

NOTE: When Qt is installed on the system, the `qt` style becomes available,
using Qt&#039;s QStyle to achieve native looking widgets.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:

- A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live
  preview of the .slint files to many editors.
- It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode)
  available from the market place.
- A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The
  `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview your UI while you are
  working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
- [**SlintPad**](https://slintpad.com/), an online editor to try out .slint syntax
  without installing anything ([sources](./tools/slintpad)).
- A [**Figma to Slint**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1474418299182276871/figma-to-slint) plugin.

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to
configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.

## Serde in action

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Click to show Cargo.toml.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2021&amp;gist=72755f28f99afc95e01d63174b28c1f5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Run this code in the playground.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;

```toml
[dependencies]

# The core APIs, including the Serialize and Deserialize traits. Always
# required when using Serde. The &quot;derive&quot; feature is only required when
# using #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] to make Serde work with structs
# and enums defined in your crate.
serde = { version = &quot;1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }

# Each data format lives in its own crate; the sample code below uses JSON
# but you may be using a different one.
serde_json = &quot;1.0&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.
    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&amp;point).unwrap();

    // Prints serialized = {&quot;x&quot;:1,&quot;y&quot;:2}
    println!(&quot;serialized = {}&quot;, serialized);

    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.
    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&amp;serialized).unwrap();

    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
    println!(&quot;deserialized = {:?}&quot;, deserialized);
}
```

## Getting help

Serde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans
congregate will be able to help you out. For chat, consider trying the
[#rust-questions] or [#rust-beginners] channels of the unofficial community
Discord (invite: &lt;https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community&gt;), the [#rust-usage] or
[#beginners] channels of the official Rust Project Discord (invite:
&lt;https://discord.gg/rust-lang&gt;), or the [#general][zulip] stream in Zulip. For
asynchronous, consider the [\[rust\] tag on StackOverflow][stackoverflow], the
[/r/rust] subreddit which has a pinned weekly easy questions post, or the Rust
[Discourse forum][discourse]. It&#039;s acceptable to file a support issue in this
repo but they tend not to get as many eyes as any of the above and may get
closed without a response after some time.

[English] | [简体中文]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

## Supported Shells

- zsh
- bash
- fish
- nushell
- xonsh

## Community

### Forum

Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: https://forum.atuin.sh/

### Discord

Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here](https://discord.gg/jR3tfchVvW)

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

# Security

If you find any security issues, we&#039;d appreciate it if you could alert ellie@atuin.sh

&lt;em&gt;The Rust HTTP server for Python&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

Granian is a Rust HTTP server for Python applications built on top of [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) and [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).

## Rationale

The main reasons behind Granian design are:

- Have a single, correct HTTP implementation, supporting versions 1, 2 (and eventually 3)
- Provide a single package for several platforms
- Avoid the usual Gunicorn + uvicorn + http-tools dependency composition on unix systems
- Provide stable [performance](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/blob/master/benchmarks/vs.md) when compared to existing alternatives

Adopting Granian would thus be a good choice when:

- wanting a modern, single dependency to serve both ASGI and WSGI applications
- looking for the most performant way to serve your Python application under HTTP/2
- you need great concurrency capabilities, especially with websockets
- you care about throughput more than everything else

On the other hand, Granian won&#039;t be the ideal option if:

- you want a *pure Python* solution
- you need advanced debugging features
- your application relies on `trio` or `gevent`
- you&#039;re looking for ASGI extensions [not (yet) implemented](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/issues/93)

## Features

- Supports ASGI/3, [RSGI](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/blob/master/docs/spec/RSGI.md) and WSGI interface applications
- HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocols
- HTTPS and mTLS
- Websockets
- Direct static files serving
- ASGI [pathsend](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html#path-send) extension

## Quickstart

You can install Granian using pip:

    $ pip install granian

### ASGI

Create an application in your `main.py`:

```python
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope[&#039;type&#039;] == &#039;http&#039;

    await send({
        &#039;type&#039;: &#039;http.response.start&#039;,
        &#039;status&#039;: 200,
        &#039;headers&#039;: [
            [b&#039;content-type&#039;, b&#039;text/plain&#039;],
        ],
    })
    await send({
        &#039;type&#039;: &#039;http.response.body&#039;,
        &#039;body&#039;: b&#039;Hello, world!&#039;,
    })
```

and serve it using Granian CLI:

    $ granian --interface asgi main:app

### RSGI

Create an application your `main.py`:

```python
async def app(scope, proto):
    assert scope.proto == &#039;http&#039;

    proto.response_str(
        status=200,
        headers=[
            (&#039;content-type&#039;, &#039;text/plain&#039;)
        ],
        body=&quot;Hello, world!&quot;
    )
```

and serve it using Granian CLI:

    $ granian --interface rsgi main:app

### WSGI

Create an application your `main.py`:

```python
def app(environ, start_response):
    start_response(&#039;200 OK&#039;, [(&#039;content-type&#039;, &#039;text/plain&#039;)])
    return [b&quot;Hello, world!&quot;]
```

and serve it using Granian CLI:

    $ granian --interface wsgi main:app

## Extra dependencies

Mind that Granian also provides several extra dependencies you might be interested into, in particular:

- dotenv (allows to load environment files)
- pname (allows to customize processes&#039; names)
- reload (adds reload on changes functionality)
- [rloop](https://pypi.org/project/rloop/)
- [uvloop](https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/)
- [winloop](https://pypi.org/project/winloop/)

You can combine the above extras to suit your needs, eg:

    $ pip install granian[pname,uvloop]

For further information, check the options below.

### Human-readable durations

Whenever Granian accepts a duration, it can be specified either as sole number, in which case it is interpreted as a number of seconds, or using one of the following suffixes:

| suffix | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `s` | seconds (same as no suffix) |
| `m` | minutes |
| `h` | hours |
| `d` | days |

### Logging

Despite being a Rust project, Granian is a good Python citizen and uses the standard library&#039;s [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module to produce logs. This means you can freely configure your logging level and format using the [standard idioms](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) you probably familiar with.

As many other web servers, Granian uses two different loggers, specifically:

- the `_granian` logger for runtime messages
- the `granian.access` logger for access logs

### Access log format

The access log format can be configured by specifying the atoms (see below) to include in a specific format. By default Granian will use `[%(time)s] %(addr)s - &quot;%(method)s %(path)s %(protocol)s&quot; %(status)d %(dt_ms).3f` as the format.

#### Access log atoms

The following atoms are available for use:

| identifier | description |
| --- | --- |
| addr | Client remote address |
| time | Datetime of the request | 
| dt_ms | Request duration in ms |
| status | HTTP response status |
| path | Request path (without query string) |
| query\_string | Request query string |
| method | Request HTTP method |
| scheme | Request scheme |
| protocol | HTTP protocol version |

### Workers and threads

Granian offers different options to configure the number of workers and threads to be run, in particular:

- **workers**: the total number of processes holding a dedicated Python interpreter that will run the application
- **blocking threads**: the number of threads per worker interacting with the Python interpreter
- **runtime threads**: the number of Rust threads per worker that will perform network I/O
- **runtime blocking threads**: the number of Rust threads per worker involved in blocking

## Polars: Extremely fast Query Engine for DataFrames, written in Rust

Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use
and expressive. Key features are:

- Lazy | Eager execution
- Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Query optimization
- Multi-threaded
- Written in Rust
- SIMD
- Powerful expression API
- Front end in Python | Rust | NodeJS | R | SQL
- [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Performance 🚀🚀

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming.

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

## Managed/Distributed Polars

Do you want a managed solution or scale out to distributed clusters? Consider our
[offering](https://cloud.pola.rs/) and help the project!

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars[rt64]`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars[rtcompat]`. This version of
Polars is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target
features.

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://x.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we use Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we&#039;ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:

-   We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    -   Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    -   Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://x.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
-   We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024,the last beta release.
-   We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
-   We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
-   We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and we do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth documentation](https://reth.rs/) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://reth.rs/docs/).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

-   Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
-   See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.88.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/06/26/Rust-1.88.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://reth.rs/installation/source/).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [docs][book].

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

-   [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
-   [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
-   [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abenz1267/walker.git
cd walker

# Build with Cargo
cargo build --release

# Run Walker
./target/release/walker
```

### Dependencies

- GTK4 (version 4.6+)
- gtk4-layer-shell
- Protocol Buffers compiler
- cairo
- poppler-glib
- make sure [elephant](https://github.com/abenz1267/elephant) is running before starting Walker

&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt; &lt;h3&gt; Install using Nix &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/summary&gt;

#### 1. Add flake inputs

Add walker and elephant to the inputs of your configs `flake.nix` and set walker to follow elephant

```nix
elephant.url = &quot;github:abenz1267/elephant&quot;;

walker = {
  url = &quot;github:abenz1267/walker&quot;;
  inputs.elephant.follows = &quot;elephant&quot;;
};
```

#### 2. Install walker

You have 3 options for installing walker.

**Option A** (Home Manager Module): Import the home-manager module to your home-manager config and enable walker.

```nix
imports = [inputs.walker.homeManagerModules.default];

programs.walker.enable = true;
```

**Option B** (NixOS Module): Import the nixos module in your NixOS config and enable walker

```nix
imports = [inputs.walker.nixosModules.default];

programs.walker.enable = true;
```

&gt; Note: this option doesn&#039;t support the `runAsService` option; It is recommended that you launch the elephant and walker services using your desktop instead.

**Option C** (Package): Add `inputs.walker.packages.&lt;system&gt;.default` to your system packages or home-manager packages. replace `&lt;system&gt;` with your system architecture. Note: This option doesn&#039;t support configuration using nix.

```nix
home.packages = [inputs.walker.packages.&lt;system&gt;.default];
```

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [inputs.walker.packages.&lt;system&gt;.default];
```

#### 3. Configure walker

```nix
programs.walker = {
  enable = true;
  runAsService = true; # Note: this option isn&#039;t supported in the NixOS module only in the home-manager module

  # All options from the config.toml can be used here https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/blob/master/resources/config.toml
  config = {
    theme = &quot;your theme name&quot;;
    placeholders.&quot;default&quot; = { input = &quot;Search&quot;; list = &quot;Example&quot;; };
    providers.prefixes = [
      {provider = &quot;websearch&quot;; prefix = &quot;+&quot;;}
      {provider = &quot;providerlist&quot;; prefix = &quot;_&quot;;}
    ];
    keybinds.quick_activate = [&quot;F1&quot; &quot;F2&quot; &quot;F3&quot;];
  };
  
  # Set `programs.walker.config.theme=&quot;your theme name&quot;` to choose the default theme
  themes = {
    &quot;your theme name&quot; = {
      # Check out the default css theme as an example https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/blob/master/resources/themes/default/style.css
      style = &quot; /* css */ &quot;;

      # Check out the default layouts for examples https://github.com/abenz1267/walker/tree/master/resources/themes/default
      layouts = {
        &quot;layout&quot; = &quot; &lt;!-- xml --&gt; &quot;;
        &quot;item_calc&quot; = &quot; &lt;!-- xml --&gt; &quot;;
        # other provider layouts
      };
    };
    &quot;other theme name&quot; = {
        # ...
    };
    # more themes
  };
};
```

Optionally, there is 2 binary caches which can be used by adding the following to you config:

```nix
nix.settings = {
  extra-substituters = [&quot;https://walker.cachix.org&quot; &quot;https://walker-git.cachix.org&quot;];
  extra-trusted-public-keys = [&quot;walker.cachix.org-1:fG8q+uAaMqhsMxWjwvk0IMb4mFPFLqHjuvfwQxE4oJM=&quot; &quot;walker-git.cachix.org-1:vmC0ocfPWh0S/vRAQGtChuiZBTAe4wiKDeyyXM0/7pM=&quot;];
};
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Make sure `elephant` is running and you have providers installed. `elephant-providerlist` and f.e. `elephant-desktopapplications`.**

Launch Walker with `walker`.

In order to improve startup performance, run a Walker service with:

```bash
walker --gapplication-service
```

If the service is running, you can either open Walker with:

```bash
walker
```

or for an even faster launch make a socket call, f.e. with `openbsd-netcat`:

```bash
nc -U /run/user/1000/walker/walker.sock
```

The downside of the socket call is that it does not handle any commandline options, so it&#039;s just a faster alternative to a simple `walker` call.

## Keybinds

The following modifier keys are valid: `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, `super`.

To get a full list of possible key values, look here: [GDK key-values](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/blob/0.9/gdk4/sys/src/lib.rs#L302).

F.e. `pub const GDK_KEY_semicolon: c_int = 59;` means that `ctrl semicolon` would be a valid keybind.

## Config

Configuration should be done in `~/.config/walker`.

Check out the [default config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abenz1267/walker/refs/heads/master/resources/config.toml).

## Theming

You can customize Walker&#039;s appearance by creating a custom theme. Checkout `resources/themes/default` for the default theme. Themes inherit the default theme by default, so if you just want to change the CSS, you can just create `themes/yours/style.css`.

You can customize rendering of list items for each provider individually, f.e. &quot;item_files.xml&quot; will define the layout for items sourced from the `files` provider.

Please refer to [the GTK4 docs](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) to checkout how to write `*.xml` files for GTK4.

You can set the default theme in your `config.toml` f.e. `theme = &quot;yours&quot;`.

InfluxDB Core is a database built to collect, process, transform, and store event and time series data. It is ideal for use cases that require real-time ingest and fast query response times to build user interfaces, monitoring, and automation solutions.

Common use cases include:

- Monitoring sensor data
- Server monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Network monitoring
- Financial market and trading analytics
- Behavioral analytics

InfluxDB is optimized for scenarios where near real-time data monitoring is essential and queries 
need to return quickly to support user experiences such as dashboards and interactive user interfaces.

InfluxDB 3 Core’s feature highlights include:

- Diskless architecture with object storage support (or local disk with no dependencies)
- Fast query response times (under 10ms for last-value queries, or 30ms for distinct metadata)
- Embedded Python VM for plugins and triggers
- Parquet file persistence
- Compatibility with InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x write APIs
- Compatability with InfluxDB 1.x query API (InfluxQL)
- SQL query engine with support for FlightSQL and HTTP query API

## Project Status

InfluxDB 3 Core is GA as of April 15, 2025! We plan to have monthly point releases for the following six months, with patch releases as needed. We will move to a quarterly cadence after that for 3-4 releases, after which we&#039;ll reevaluate our release schedule.
