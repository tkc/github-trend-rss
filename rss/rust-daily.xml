![niri with a few windows open](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535e6530-2f44-4b84-a883-1240a3eee6e9)

## About

Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.

Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never &quot;overflow&quot; onto an adjacent monitor.

Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#039;s always one empty workspace present all the way down.

The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.

## Features

- Built from the ground up for scrollable tiling
- [Dynamic workspaces](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Workspaces) like in GNOME
- An [Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379a5d1f-acdb-4c11-b36c-e85fd91f0995) that zooms out workspaces and windows
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor and window screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    - You can [block out](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Window-Rules#block-out-from) sensitive windows from screencasts
    - [Dynamic cast target](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Screencasting#dynamic-screencast-target) that can change what it shows on the go
- [Touchpad](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/946a910e-9bec-4cd1-a923-4a9421707515) and [mouse](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/8464e65d-4bf2-44fa-8c8e-5883355bd000) gestures
- Group windows into [tabs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Tabs)
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- [Gradient borders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Layout#gradients) with Oklab and Oklch support
- [Animations](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/ce178da2-af9e-4c51-876f-8709c241d95e) with support for [custom shaders](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/assets/1794388/27a238d6-0a22-4692-b794-30dc7a626fad)
- Live-reloading config

## Status

Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our [Matrix channel].

Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
Have your [waybar]s and [fuzzel]s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.

Here are some points you may have questions about:

- **Multi-monitor**: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.
- **Fractional scaling**: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.
- **NVIDIA**: seems to work fine.
- **Floating windows**: yes, starting from niri 25.01.
- **Input devices**: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use [OpenTabletDriver].
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.
- **Wlr protocols**: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on [wayland.app](https://wayland.app) at the bottom of each protocol&#039;s page.
- **Performance**: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I&#039;ve seen someone use it fine on an Eee PC 900 from 2008, of all things.
- **Xwayland**: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is [easy to set up](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-xwayland-satellite) and works very well.
    - Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.
    - JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.
    - Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.
    - X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won&#039;t work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like [labwc](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#using-the-labwc-wayland-compositor) or [rootful Xwayland](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Xwayland#directly-running-xwayland-in-rootful-mode).
    - Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.
    For games, you can run them in [gamescope] at native resolution, even with display scaling.

## Inspiration

Niri is heavily inspired by [PaperWM] which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.

One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell&#039;s global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.

## Tile Scrollably Elsewhere

Here are some other projects which implement a similar workflow:

- [PaperWM]: scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.
- [karousel]: scrollable tiling on top of KDE.
- [scroll](https://github.com/dawsers/scroll) and [papersway]: scrollable tiling on top of sway/i3.
- [hyprscrolling] and [hyprslidr]: scrollable tiling on top of Hyprland.
- [PaperWM.spoon]: scrollable tiling on top of macOS.

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Troubleshooting)

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

## About

* **[Features](https://bevy.org):** A quick overview of Bevy&#039;s features.
* **[News](https://bevy.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.
For example, [`bevy_mikktspace`](./crates/bevy_mikktspace/README.md#license-agreement) has code under the Zlib license (as well as a copyright notice when choosing the MIT license).

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.
See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the details of the licenses of those files.

## Quickstart

Run Forge in interactive mode via npx

```bash
npx forgecode@latest
```

Connect through the Forge app and complete the OAuth process.
This will open your browser to app.forgecode.dev where you can sign up or sign in with Google/GitHub.

That&#039;s it! Forge is now ready to assist you with your development tasks.

## Usage Examples

Forge can be used in different ways depending on your needs. Here are some common usage patterns:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; Can you explain how the authentication system works in this codebase?
```

Forge will analyze your project&#039;s structure, identify authentication-related files, and provide a detailed explanation of the authentication flow, including the relationships between different components.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing New Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I need to add a dark mode toggle to our React application. How should I approach this?
```

Forge will suggest the best approach based on your current codebase, explain the steps needed, and even scaffold the necessary components and styles for you.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I&#039;m getting this error: &quot;TypeError: Cannot read property &#039;map&#039; of undefined&quot;. What might be causing it?
```

Forge will analyze the error, suggest potential causes based on your code, and propose different solutions to fix the issue.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; Please review the code in src/components/UserProfile.js and suggest improvements
```

Forge will analyze the code, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements for readability, performance, security, and maintainability.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning New Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I want to integrate GraphQL into this Express application. Can you explain how to get started?
```

Forge will provide a tailored tutorial on integrating GraphQL with Express, using your specific project structure as context.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Schema Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I need to design a database schema for a blog with users, posts, comments, and categories
```

Forge will suggest an appropriate schema design, including tables/collections, relationships, indexes, and constraints based on your project&#039;s existing database technology.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring Legacy Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; Help me refactor this class-based component to use React Hooks
```

Forge can help modernize your codebase by walking you through refactoring steps and implementing them with your approval.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```
&gt; I need to merge branch &#039;feature/user-profile&#039; into main but there are conflicts
```

Forge can guide you through resolving git conflicts, explaining the differences and suggesting the best way to reconcile them.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Why Forge?

Forge is designed for developers who want to enhance their workflow with AI assistance while maintaining full control over their development environment.

- **Zero configuration** - Just add your API key and you&#039;re ready to go
- **Seamless integration** - Works right in your terminal, where you already work
- **Multi-provider support** - Use OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM providers
- **Secure by design** - Your code stays on your machine
- **Open-source** - Transparent, extensible, and community-driven

Forge helps you code faster, solve complex problems, and learn new technologies without leaving your terminal.

## Command-Line Options

Here&#039;s a quick reference of Forge&#039;s command-line options:

| Option                          | Description                                                |

## Advanced Configuration

### Provider Configuration

Forge supports multiple AI providers. Below are setup instructions for each supported provider:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;forgecode.dev (Recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
FORGE_KEY=ForgeKey
```

To use Forgecode&#039;s provider with Forge:

1. Visit [https://app.forgecode.dev/](https://app.forgecode.dev/)
2. Login with your existing credentials or create a new account
3. Once logged in, your account will automatically enable the Forge Provider

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenRouter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=&lt;your_openrouter_api_key&gt;
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requesty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
REQUESTY_API_KEY=&lt;your_requesty_api_key&gt;
```

_No changes in `forge.yaml` required_

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;x-ai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
XAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_xai_api_key&gt;
```

switch the model using `/model` command in the Forge CLI.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_openai_api_key&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: o3-mini-high
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&lt;your_anthropic_api_key&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: claude-3.7-sonnet
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Vertex AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
PROJECT_ID=&lt;your_project_id&gt;
LOCATION=&lt;your_location&gt;
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;vertex_ai_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=https://${LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/endpoints/openapi
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-7-sonnet
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI-Compatible Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_provider_api_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=&lt;your_provider_url&gt;
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: &lt;provider-specific-model&gt;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groq&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_groq_api_key&gt;
OPENAI_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
```

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Bedrock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

To use Amazon Bedrock models with Forge, you&#039;ll need to first set up the [Bedrock Access Gateway](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway):

1. **Set up Bedrock Access Gateway**:

   - Follow the deployment steps in the [Bedrock Access Gateway repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-access-gateway)
   - Create your own API key in Secrets Manager
   - Deploy the CloudFormation stack
   - Note your API Base URL from the CloudFormation outputs

2. **Create these files in your project directory**:

   ```bash
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your_bedrock_gateway_api_key&gt;
   OPENAI_URL=&lt;your_bedrock_gateway_base_url&gt;
   ```

   ```yaml
   # forge.yaml
   model: anthropic.claude-3-opus
   ```

   &lt;/details&gt;

### forge.yaml Configuration Options

The `forge.yaml` file supports several advanced configuration options that let you customize Forge&#039;s behavior.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Add your own guidelines that all agents should follow when generating responses.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
custom_rules: |
  1. Always add comprehensive error handling to any code you write.
  2. Include unit tests for all new functions.
  3. Follow our team&#039;s naming convention: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Define custom commands as shortcuts for repetitive prompts:

```yaml
# forge.yaml
commands:
  - name: &#039;refactor&#039;
    description: &#039;Refactor selected code&#039;
    prompt: &#039;Please refactor this code to improve readability and performance&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Specify the default AI model to use for all agents in the workflow.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
model: &#039;claude-3.7-sonnet&#039;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Walker Depth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Control how deeply Forge traverses your project directory structure when gathering context.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_walker_depth: 3 # Limit directory traversal to 3 levels deep
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Adjust the creativity and randomness in AI responses. Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (0.7-2.0) generate more diverse and creative results.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
temperature: 0.7 # Balanced creativity and focus
```

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool Max Failure Limit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Control how many times a tool can fail before Forge forces completion to prevent infinite retry loops. This helps avoid situations where an agent gets stuck repeatedly trying the same failing operation.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
tool_max_failure_limit: 3 # Allow up to 3 failures per tool before forcing completion
```

Set to a higher value if you want more retry attempts, or lower if you want faster failure detection.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Requests Per Turn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Limit the maximum number of requests an agent can make in a single conversation turn. This prevents runaway conversations and helps control API usage and costs.

```yaml
# forge.yaml
max_requests_per_turn: 50 # Allow up to 50 requests per turn
```

When this limit is reached, Forge will:
- Ask you if you wish to continue
- If you respond with &#039;Yes&#039;, it will continue the conversation
- If you respond with &#039;No&#039;, it will end the conversation

&lt;/details&gt;

---

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

The MCP feature allows AI agents to communicate with external tools and services. This implementation follows Anthropic&#039;s [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) design.

### MCP Configuration

Configure MCP servers using the CLI:

```bash
# List all MCP servers
forge mcp list

# Add a new server
forge mcp add

# Add a server using JSON format
forge mcp add-json

# Get server details
forge mcp get

# Remove a server
forge mcp remove
```

Or manually create a `.mcp.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
	&quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
		&quot;server_name&quot;: {
			&quot;command&quot;: &quot;command_to_execute&quot;,
			&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;],
			&quot;env&quot;: { &quot;ENV_VAR&quot;: &quot;value&quot; }
		},
		&quot;another_server&quot;: {
			&quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000/events&quot;
		}
	}
}
```

MCP configurations are read from two locations (in order of precedence):

1. Local configuration (project-specific)
2. User configuration (user-specific)

### Example Use Cases

MCP can be used for various integrations:

- Web browser automation
- External API interactions
- Tool integration
- Custom service connections

### Usage in Multi-Agent Workflows

MCP tools can be used as part of multi-agent workflows, allowing specialized agents to interact with external systems as part of a collaborative problem-solving approach.

&lt;/details&gt;

- Follow the instructions above for the platform you are building on

### OpenHarmony

- Follow the instructions above for the platform you are building on to prepare the environment.
- Depending on the target distribution (e.g. `HarmonyOS NEXT` vs pure `OpenHarmony`) the build configuration will differ slightly.
- Ensure that the following environment variables are set
  - `DEVECO_SDK_HOME` (Required when targeting `HarmonyOS NEXT`)
  - `OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME` (Required when targeting `OpenHarmony`)
  - `OHOS_SDK_NATIVE` (e.g. `${DEVECO_SDK_HOME}/default/openharmony/native` or `${OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME}/${API_VERSION}/native`)
  - `SERVO_OHOS_SIGNING_CONFIG`: Path to json file containing a valid signing configuration for the demo app.
- Review the detailed instructions at [Building for OpenHarmony].
- The target distribution can be modified by passing `--flavor=&lt;default|harmonyos&gt;` to `mach &lt;build|package|install&gt;.

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

## Core primitives

The basic primitives Restate offers to simplify application development are the following:

* **Reliable Execution**: Restate guarantees code runs to completion. Failures result in retries that use the [Durable Execution mechanism](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/durable_execution) to recover partial progress and prevent re-executing completed steps.
* **Reliable Communication**: Services communicate with exactly-once semantics: whether it&#039;s [request-response, one-way messages, or scheduled tasks](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/invocations). Restate reliably delivers messages and uses Durable Execution to ensure no losses or duplicates can happen.
* **Durable Promises and Timers**: Register Promises/Futures and timers in Restate to make them resilient to failures (e.g. sleep, webhooks, timers). Restate can recover them across failures, processes, and time.
* **Consistent State**: Implement [stateful entities](https://docs.restate.dev/concepts/services) with isolated K/V state per entity. Restate persists the K/V state updates together with the execution progress to ensure consistent state. Restate attaches the K/V state to the request on invocation, and writes it back upon completion. This is particularly efficient for FaaS deployments (stateful serverless, yay!).
* **Suspending User Code**: long-running code suspends when awaiting on a Promise/Future and resumes when that promise is resolved. This is particularly useful in combination with serverless deployments.
* **Observability &amp; Introspection**: Restate includes a UI and CLI to inspect the [state of your application](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/introspection) across services and invocations. Restate automatically generates Open Telemetry traces for the interactions between handlers.

&lt;/p&gt;

Provides an implementation of today&#039;s most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and
versatility.

## Main features:

 - Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today&#039;s most used tokenizers.
 - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes
   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server&#039;s CPU.
 - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.
 - Designed for research and production.
 - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It&#039;s always possible to get the part of the
   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.
 - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.

## Performances
Performances can vary depending on hardware, but running the [~/bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py](bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py) should give the following on a g6 aws instance:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b913d4b-e488-4cbc-b542-f90a6c40643d)


## Bindings

We provide bindings to the following languages (more to come!):
  - [Rust](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/tokenizers) (Original implementation)
  - [Python](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/python)
  - [Node.js](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/node)
  - [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/tokenizers-ruby) (Contributed by @ankane, external repo)

## Installation

You can install from source using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers.git#subdirectory=bindings/python
```

our install the released versions with

```bash
pip install tokenizers
```
 
## Quick example using Python:

Choose your model between Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece or Unigram and instantiate a tokenizer:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
```

You can customize how pre-tokenization (e.g., splitting into words) is done:

```python
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()
```

Then training your tokenizer on a set of files just takes two lines of codes:

```python
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

trainer = BpeTrainer(special_tokens=[&quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;[CLS]&quot;, &quot;[SEP]&quot;, &quot;[PAD]&quot;, &quot;[MASK]&quot;])
tokenizer.train(files=[&quot;wiki.train.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.valid.raw&quot;, &quot;wiki.test.raw&quot;], trainer=trainer)
```

Once your tokenizer is trained, encode any text with just one line:
```python
output = tokenizer.encode(&quot;Hello, y&#039;all! How are you 😁 ?&quot;)
print(output.tokens)
# [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;&#039;&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;How&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;?&quot;]
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># The Rust Programming Language

![Build Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source of &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch].

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

See the [releases] to download just the code of all the code listings that appear in the book.

[releases]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/releases

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --locked --version &lt;version_num&gt;
```

The book also uses two mdbook plugins which are part of this repository. If you
do not install them, you will see warnings when building and the output will not
look right, but you _will_ still be able to build the book. To use the plugins,
you should run:

```bash
$ cargo install --locked --path packages/mdbook-trpl --force
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_

```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Firefox&quot; book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;firefox.exe&quot; .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_

```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process &quot;chrome.exe&quot; .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cd packages/trpl
$ mdbook test --library-path packages/trpl/target/debug/deps
```

## Contributing

We&#039;d love your help! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] to learn about the
kinds of contributions we&#039;re looking for.

[contrib]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because the book is [printed][nostarch], and because we want
to keep the online version of the book close to the print version when
possible, it may take longer than you&#039;re used to for us to address your issue
or pull request.

So far, we&#039;ve been doing a larger revision to coincide with [Rust Editions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/). Between those larger
revisions, we will only be correcting errors. If your issue or pull request
isn&#039;t strictly fixing an error, it might sit until the next time that we&#039;re
working on a large revision: expect on the order of months or years. Thank you
for your patience!

### Translations

We&#039;d love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We&#039;re waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

[Translations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranslations
[mdbook support]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script available in the `ci` directory. It needs a dictionary of valid words,
which is provided in `ci/dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false
positive (say, you used the word `BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid),
you need to add this word to `ci/dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for
consistency).

## A quick taste of SeaORM

### Entity
```rust
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = &quot;cake&quot;)]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelation)]
pub enum Relation {
    #[sea_orm(has_many = &quot;super::fruit::Entity&quot;)]
    Fruit,
}

impl Related&lt;super::fruit::Entity&gt; for Entity {
    fn to() -&gt; RelationDef {
        Relation::Fruit.def()
    }
}
```

### Select
```rust
// find all models
let cakes: Vec&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find().all(db).await?;

// find and filter
let chocolate: Vec&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find()
    .filter(cake::Column::Name.contains(&quot;chocolate&quot;))
    .all(db)
    .await?;

// find one model
let cheese: Option&lt;cake::Model&gt; = Cake::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let cheese: cake::Model = cheese.unwrap();

// find related models (lazy)
let fruits: Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = cheese.find_related(Fruit).all(db).await?;

// find related models (eager)
let cake_with_fruits: Vec&lt;(cake::Model, Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt;)&gt; =
    Cake::find().find_with_related(Fruit).all(db).await?;
```
### Nested Select

```rust
use sea_orm::DerivePartialModel;

#[derive(DerivePartialModel)]
#[sea_orm(entity = &quot;cake::Entity&quot;, from_query_result)]
struct CakeWithFruit {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    #[sea_orm(nested)]
    fruit: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt;,
}

let cakes: Vec&lt;CakeWithFruit&gt; = cake::Entity::find()
    .left_join(fruit::Entity)
    .into_partial_model()
    .all(db)
    .await?;
```

### Insert
```rust
let apple = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set(&quot;Apple&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default() // no need to set primary key
};

let pear = fruit::ActiveModel {
    name: Set(&quot;Pear&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// insert one
let pear = pear.insert(db).await?;

// insert many returning last insert id
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear]).exec(db).await?;
result.last_insert_id == Some(2);
```

### Insert (advanced)
```rust
// insert many with returning (if supported by database)
let models: Vec&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .exec_with_returning(db)
    .await?;
models[0]
    == fruit::Model {
        id: 1,
        name: &quot;Apple&quot;.to_owned(),
        cake_id: None,
    };

// insert with ON CONFLICT on primary key do nothing, with MySQL specific polyfill
let result = Fruit::insert_many([apple, pear])
    .on_conflict_do_nothing()
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

matches!(result, TryInsertResult::Conflicted);
```

### Update
```rust
use sea_orm::sea_query::{Expr, Value};

let pear: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let mut pear: fruit::ActiveModel = pear.unwrap().into();

pear.name = Set(&quot;Sweet pear&quot;.to_owned());

// update one
let pear: fruit::Model = pear.update(db).await?;

// update many: UPDATE &quot;fruit&quot; SET &quot;cake_id&quot; = NULL WHERE &quot;fruit&quot;.&quot;name&quot; LIKE &#039;%Apple%&#039;
Fruit::update_many()
    .col_expr(fruit::Column::CakeId, Expr::value(Value::Int(None)))
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains(&quot;Apple&quot;))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

```
### Save
```rust
let banana = fruit::ActiveModel {
    id: NotSet,
    name: Set(&quot;Banana&quot;.to_owned()),
    ..Default::default()
};

// create, because primary key `id` is `NotSet`
let mut banana = banana.save(db).await?;

banana.name = Set(&quot;Banana Mongo&quot;.to_owned());

// update, because primary key `id` is `Set`
let banana = banana.save(db).await?;

```
### Delete
```rust
// delete one
let orange: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();
fruit::Entity::delete(orange.into_active_model())
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

// or simply
let orange: Option&lt;fruit::Model&gt; = Fruit::find_by_id(1).one(db).await?;
let orange: fruit::Model = orange.unwrap();
orange.delete(db).await?;

// delete many: DELETE FROM &quot;fruit&quot; WHERE &quot;fruit&quot;.&quot;name&quot; LIKE &#039;Orange&#039;
fruit::Entity::delete_many()
    .filter(fruit::Column::Name.contains(&quot;Orange&quot;))
    .exec(db)
    .await?;

```

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui 的中文翻译文档 / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

Check the wiki to find [3rd party integrations](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-integrations)
and [egui crates](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates).

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version

Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

## Usage

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; The web-vault requires the use a secure context for the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API).
&gt; That means it will only work via `http://localhost:8000` (using the port from the example below) or if you [enable HTTPS](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS).

The recommended way to install and use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pkgs/container/vaultwarden), [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/vaultwarden/server).
See [which container image to use](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Which-container-image-to-use) for an explanation of the provided tags.

There are also [community driven packages](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Third-party-packages) which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

Alternatively, you can also [build Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Building-binary) yourself.

While Vaultwarden is based upon the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs) which has built-in support for TLS our recommendation would be that you setup a reverse proxy (see [proxy examples](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples)).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;**For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our [Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).**

### Docker/Podman CLI

Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.&lt;br&gt;
You can replace `docker` with `podman` if you prefer to use podman.

```shell
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN=&quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot; \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

### Docker Compose

To use Docker compose you need to create a `compose.yaml` which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DOMAIN: &quot;https://vw.domain.tld&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data/:/data/
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80
```

&lt;br&gt;

[Ratatui][Ratatui Website] (_ˌræ.təˈtu.i_) is a Rust crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces
(TUIs). It provides a simple and flexible way to create text-based user interfaces in the terminal,
which can be used for command-line applications, dashboards, and other interactive console programs.

## Quickstart

Ratatui has [templates] available to help you get started quickly. You can use the
[`cargo-generate`] command to create a new project with Ratatui:

```shell
cargo install --locked cargo-generate
cargo generate ratatui/templates
```

Selecting the Hello World template produces the following application:

```rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use crossterm::event::{self, Event};
use ratatui::{DefaultTerminal, Frame};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    let terminal = ratatui::init();
    let result = run(terminal);
    ratatui::restore();
    result
}

fn run(mut terminal: DefaultTerminal) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    loop {
        terminal.draw(render)?;
        if matches!(event::read()?, Event::Key(_)) {
            break Ok(());
        }
    }
}

fn render(frame: &amp;mut Frame) {
    frame.render_widget(&quot;hello world&quot;, frame.area());
}
```

## Acknowledgements

Ratatui was forked from the [tui-rs] crate in 2023 in order to continue its development. None of
this could be possible without [Florian Dehau] who originally created [tui-rs] which inspired many
Rust TUIs.

Special thanks to [Pavel Fomchenkov] for his work in designing an awesome logo for the Ratatui
project and organization.

Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent,
mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded
platforms. Tock&#039;s design centers around protection, both from potentially
malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to
protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and
device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides
compile-time memory safety and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel
(e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific
device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock
uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the
kernel.

  &lt;summary&gt;Other Tock-related papers&lt;/summary&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are two shorter papers that look at potential limitations of the Rust language for embedded software development.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># pattrns

***pattrns*** is an experimental imperative-style music sequence generator engine. 

It allows you to programmatically create music sequences either in plain [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as library (*static, compiled*) or in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as a scripting engine (*dynamic, interpreted*). So it&#039;s also suitable for [live coding music](https://github.com/pjagielski/awesome-live-coding-music).

In addition to its imperative event generator approach, it also supports the creation of musical events using [tidalcycle](https://tidalcycles.org/)&#039;s mini-notation.

This crate only deals with the *generation of raw musical events*. It does not generate audio. You must use an application with built-in support for pattrns to use it.


## Conceptional Overview

pattrns generates musical sequences using three distinct components, stages:

- **Rhythm**: (`pulse` in scripts) dynamic pulse generator to define a rhythmical pulse train.
- **Gate**: (`gate` in scripts) optional pulse filter between rhythm and event emitter.
- **Emitter**: (`event` in scripts), dynamic note or parameter event generator which gets triggered by the pulse train.

By separating the rhythmical from the tonal part of a musical sequence, each part can be freely modified, composed and (re)combined as it fits. 


## Documentation &amp; Guides

Read the [Scripting Book](https://renoise.github.io/pattrns/).
It contains an introduction, guides, full Lua API documentation and bunch of script examples.

The Rust backend uses standard Rust documentation features. The docs are currently not hosted online (yet), but you can generate them locally via `cargo doc --open`.

## Applications

- [`Online Playground`](https://pattrns.renoise.com) is a simple browser based playground app. It allows you to learn and test how pattrns works.

- [`Renoise`](https://www.renoise.com) uses pattrns in its [phrase editor](https://tutorials.renoise.com/wiki/Phrase_Editor).

## Integration Examples

- [`examples/play.rs`](./examples/play.rs) demonstrates how to use patterns using only Rust: it defines and plays a little music thing. The content can only be changed at compile time.

- [`examples/play-script.rs`](./examples/play-script.rs) is an example using the Lua API: it also defines and plays a little music thing, but its content can be added/removed and changed on the fly to do some basic live music hacking.  


## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [unlessgames](https://github.com/unlessgames) for adding the Tidal Cycles mini-notation support.


## Contribute

Patches are welcome! Please fork the latest git repository and create a feature or bugfix branch.

_Arch is a proxy server designed as a modular edge and AI gateway for agentic apps_&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Arch handles the *pesky low-level work* in building agentic apps — like applying guardrails, clarifying vague user input, routing prompts to the right agent, and unifying access to any LLM. It’s a language and framework friendly infrastructure layer designed to help you build and ship agentic apps faster.

# Overview
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/arch-3?embed=true&amp;utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-arch&amp;#0045;3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=565761&amp;theme=dark&amp;period=daily&amp;t=1742359429995&quot; alt=&quot;Arch - Build&amp;#0032;fast&amp;#0044;&amp;#0032;hyper&amp;#0045;personalized&amp;#0032;agents&amp;#0032;with&amp;#0032;intelligent&amp;#0032;infra | Product Hunt&quot; style=&quot;width: 188px; height: 41px;&quot; width=&quot;188&quot; height=&quot;41&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

AI demos are easy to build. But past the thrill of a quick hack, you are left building, maintaining and scaling low-level plumbing code for agents that slows down AI innovation. For example:

- You want to build specialized agents, but get stuck building **routing and handoff** code.
- You want use new LLMs, but struggle to **quickly and safely add LLMs** without writing integration code.
- You&#039;re bogged down with prompt engineering work to **clarify user intent and validate inputs**.
- You&#039;re wasting cycles choosing and integrating code for **observability** instead of it happening transparently.

With Arch, you can move faster by focusing on higher-level objectives in a language and framework agnostic way. **Arch** was built by the contributors of [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

&gt;Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems to improve speed and accuracy for common agentic scenarios  – all outside core application logic.*

**Core Features**:

  - `🚦 Routing to Agents`. Engineered with purpose-built [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-function-66f209a693ea8df14317ad68) for fast (&lt;100ms) agent routing and hand-off scenarios
  - `🔗 Routing to LLMs`: Unify access and routing to any LLM, including dynamic routing via [preference policies](#Preference-based-Routing).
  - `⛨ Guardrails`: Centrally configure and prevent harmful outcomes and ensure safe user interactions
  - `⚡ Tools Use`: For common agentic scenarios let Arch instantly clarify and convert prompts to tools/API calls
  - `🕵 Observability`: W3C compatible request tracing and LLM metrics that instantly plugin with popular tools
  - `🧱 Built on Envoy`: Arch runs alongside app servers as a containerized process, and builds on top of [Envoy&#039;s](https://envoyproxy.io) proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Today, the function calling LLM (Arch-Function) designed for the agentic and RAG scenarios is hosted free of charge in the US-central region. To offer consistent latencies and throughput, and to manage our expenses, we will enable access to the hosted version via developers keys soon, and give you the option to run that LLM locally. For more details see this issue [#258](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw/issues/258)

## Quickstart

Follow this quickstart guide to use arch gateway to build a simple AI agent. Laster in the section we will see how you can Arch Gateway to manage access keys, provide unified access to upstream LLMs and to provide e2e observability.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. [Docker System](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (v24)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.29)
3. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.12)

Arch&#039;s CLI allows you to manage and interact with the Arch gateway efficiently. To install the CLI, simply run the following command:

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend that developers create a new Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies before installing Arch. This ensures that archgw and its dependencies do not interfere with other packages on your system.

```console
$ python3.12 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install archgw==0.3.4
```

### Build Agentic Apps with Arch Gateway

In following quickstart we will show you how easy it is to build AI agent with Arch gateway. We will build a currency exchange agent using following simple steps. For this demo we will use `https://api.frankfurter.dev/` to fetch latest price for currencies and assume USD as base currency.

#### Step 1. Create arch config file

Create `arch_config.yaml` file with following content,

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  ingress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 10000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    model: openai/gpt-4o

system_prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

prompt_guards:
  input_guards:
    jailbreak:
      on_exception:
        message: Looks like you&#039;re curious about my abilities, but I can only provide assistance for currency exchange.

prompt_targets:
  - name: currency_exchange
    description: Get currency exchange rate from USD to other currencies
    parameters:
      - name: currency_symbol
        description: the currency that needs conversion
        required: true
        type: str
        in_path: true
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/latest?base=USD&amp;symbols={currency_symbol}
    system_prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant. Show me the currency symbol you want to convert from USD.

  - name: get_supported_currencies
    description: Get list of supported currencies for conversion
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/currencies

endpoints:
  frankfurther_api:
    endpoint: api.frankfurter.dev:443
    protocol: https
```

#### Step 2. Start arch gateway with currency conversion config

```sh

$ archgw up arch_config.yaml
2024-12-05 16:56:27,979 - cli.main - INFO - Starting archgw cli version: 0.3.4
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.utils - INFO - Schema validation successful!
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.main - INFO - Starting arch model server and arch gateway
2024-12-05 16:56:51,647 - cli.core - INFO - Container is healthy!
```

Once the gateway is up you can start interacting with at port 10000 using openai chat completion API.

Some of the sample queries you can ask could be `what is currency rate for gbp?` or `show me list of currencies for conversion`.

#### Step 3. Interacting with gateway using curl command

Here is a sample curl command you can use to interact,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;what is exchange rate for gbp&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;As of the date provided in your context, December 5, 2024, the exchange rate for GBP (British Pound) from USD (United States Dollar) is 0.78558. This means that 1 USD is equivalent to 0.78558 GBP.&quot;

```

And to get list of supported currencies,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;show me list of currencies that are supported for conversion&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;Here is a list of the currencies that are supported for conversion from USD, along with their symbols:\n\n1. AUD - Australian Dollar\n2. BGN - Bulgarian Lev\n3. BRL - Brazilian Real\n4. CAD - Canadian Dollar\n5. CHF - Swiss Franc\n6. CNY - Chinese Renminbi Yuan\n7. CZK - Czech Koruna\n8. DKK - Danish Krone\n9. EUR - Euro\n10. GBP - British Pound\n11. HKD - Hong Kong Dollar\n12. HUF - Hungarian Forint\n13. IDR - Indonesian Rupiah\n14. ILS - Israeli New Sheqel\n15. INR - Indian Rupee\n16. ISK - Icelandic Króna\n17. JPY - Japanese Yen\n18. KRW - South Korean Won\n19. MXN - Mexican Peso\n20. MYR - Malaysian Ringgit\n21. NOK - Norwegian Krone\n22. NZD - New Zealand Dollar\n23. PHP - Philippine Peso\n24. PLN - Polish Złoty\n25. RON - Romanian Leu\n26. SEK - Swedish Krona\n27. SGD - Singapore Dollar\n28. THB - Thai Baht\n29. TRY - Turkish Lira\n30. USD - United States Dollar\n31. ZAR - South African Rand\n\nIf you want to convert USD to any of these currencies, you can select the one you are interested in.&quot;

```

### Use Arch as a LLM Router
Arch supports two primary routing strategies for LLMs: model-based routing and preference-based routing.

#### Model-based Routing
Model-based routing allows you to configure static model names for routing. This is useful when you always want to use a specific model for certain tasks, or manually swap between models. Below an example configuration for model-based routing, and you can follow our [usage guide](demos/use_cases/README.md) on how to get working.

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  egress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 12000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    default: true

  - access_key: $MISTRAL_API_KEY
    model: mistral/mistral-3b-latest
```

#### Preference-based Routing
Preference-based routing is designed for more dynamic and intelligent selection of models. Instead of static model names, you write plain-language routing policies that describe the type of task or preference — for example:

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  egress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 12000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - model: openai/gpt-4.1
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    default: true
    routing_preferences:
      - name: code generation
        description: generating new code snippets, functions, or boilerplate based on user prompts or requirements

  - model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    routing_preferences:
      - name: code understanding
        description: understand and explain existing code snippets, functions, or libraries
```

Arch uses a lightweight 1.5B autoregressive model to map prompts (and conversation context) to these policies. This approach adapts to intent drift, supports multi-turn conversations, and avoids the brittleness of embedding-based classifiers or manual if/else chains. No retraining is required when adding new models or updating policies — routing is governed entirely by human-readable rules. You can learn more about the design, benchmarks, and methodology behind preference-based routing in our paper:

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## [Observability](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html)
Arch is designed to support best-in class observability by supporting open standards. Please read our [docs](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html) on observability for more details on tracing, metrics, and logs. The screenshot below is from our integration with Signoz (among others)

## Debugging

When debugging issues / errors application logs and access logs provide key information to give you more context on whats going on with the system. Arch gateway runs in info log level and following is a typical output you could see in a typical interaction between developer and arch gateway,

```
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground

Log level can be changed to debug to get more details. To enable debug logs edit (supervisord.conf)[arch/supervisord.conf], change the log level `--component-log-level wasm:info` to `--component-log-level wasm:debug`. And after that you need to rebuild docker image and restart the arch gateway using following set of commands,

```
# make sure you are at the root of the repo
$ archgw build
# go to your service that has arch_config.yaml file and issue following command,
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground
```

## About

`Television` is a cross-platform, fast and extensible fuzzy finder for the terminal.

It integrates with your shell and lets you quickly search through any kind of data source (files, git repositories, environment variables, docker
images, you name it) using a fuzzy matching algorithm and is designed to be extensible.

It is inspired by the neovim [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin and leverages [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and the [nucleo](https://github.com/helix-editor/nucleo) matcher used by the [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) editor to ensure optimal performance.

## Installation

See [installation docs](https://alexpasmantier.github.io/television/docs/Users/installation).

## TL;DR

Create a channel: _~/.config/television/cable/files.toml_

```toml
[metadata]
name = &quot;files&quot;
description = &quot;A channel to select files and directories&quot;
requirements = [&quot;fd&quot;, &quot;bat&quot;]

[source]
command = &quot;fd -t f&quot;

[preview]
command = &quot;bat -n --color=always &#039;{}&#039;&quot;
env = { BAT_THEME = &quot;Catppuccin Mocha&quot; }

[ui]
preview_panel = { &quot;size&quot; = 70, &quot;scrollbar&quot; = true }

[keybindings]
shortcut = &quot;f1&quot;
```

Start searching:

```sh
tv files
```

![tv files](./assets/tv-transparent.png)

Switch channels using the remote control and pick from a list of [community-maintained channels](https://alexpasmantier.github.io/television/docs/Users/community-channels-unix) which
you can install with `tv update-channels`:

![tv remote](./assets/tv-files-remote.png)

See the [channels docs](https://alexpasmantier.github.io/television/docs/Users/channels) for more info on how to set these up.

## Usage

```bash
tv  # default channel

tv [channel]  # e.g. `tv files`, `tv env`, `tv git-repos`, etc.

# pipe the output of your program into tv
my_program | tv

fd -t f . | tv --preview &#039;bat -n --color=always {}&#039;

# or build your own channel on the fly
tv --source-command &#039;fd -t f .&#039; --preview-command &#039;bat -n --color=always {}&#039; --preview-size 70
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 🐚 _Television has **builtin shell integration**. More info [here](https://alexpasmantier.github.io/television/docs/Users/shell-integration)._

## Credits

This project was inspired by the **awesome** work done by the [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) neovim plugin.

It also leverages the great [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) editor&#039;s nucleo fuzzy matching library, the [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) async runtime as well as the **formidable** [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui) library.
