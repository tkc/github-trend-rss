### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we’ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:
* We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    * Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    * Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
* We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.
* We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
* We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
* We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth Book](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.86.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/04/03/Rust-1.86.0/).

See the book for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source.html).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |

| m8g.metal-24xl |                  |              |              |
| m8g.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.13 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/) for
    [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

&gt; Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it&#039;s actually
&gt; running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

&gt; Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
&gt; our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
&gt; cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

&gt; Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
&gt; ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It&#039;s fast enough that I added
&gt; it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

&gt; Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it&#039;s so fast I couldn&#039;t believe
&gt; it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

&gt; This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.

Or install Ruff with `uv` (recommended), `pip`, or `pipx`:

```shell
# With uv.
uv tool install ruff@latest  # Install Ruff globally.
uv add --dev ruff            # Or add Ruff to your project.

# With pip.
pip install ruff

# With pipx.
pipx install ruff
```

Starting with version `0.5.0`, Ruff can be installed with our standalone installers:

```shell
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/install.ps1 | iex&quot;

# For a specific version.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/ruff/0.11.8/install.sh | sh
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/ruff/0.11.8/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

You can also install Ruff via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruff), [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ruff),
and with [a variety of other package managers](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/).

### Usage

To run Ruff as a linter, try any of the following:

```shell
ruff check                          # Lint all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/            # Lint all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff check path/to/code/*.py        # Lint all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff check path/to/code/to/file.py  # Lint `file.py`.
ruff check @arguments.txt           # Lint using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Or, to run Ruff as a formatter:

```shell
ruff format                          # Format all files in the current directory (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/            # Format all files in `/path/to/code` (and any subdirectories).
ruff format path/to/code/*.py        # Format all `.py` files in `/path/to/code`.
ruff format path/to/code/to/file.py  # Format `file.py`.
ruff format @arguments.txt           # Format using an input file, treating its contents as newline-delimited command-line arguments.
```

Ruff can also be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook via [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit):

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.11.8
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

Ruff can also be used as a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) or with [various other editors](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup).

Ruff can also be used as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) via
[`ruff-action`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-action):

```yaml
name: Ruff
on: [ push, pull_request ]
jobs:
  ruff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3
```

### Configuration&lt;a id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file (see:
[_Configuration_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/), or [_Settings_](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/)
for a complete list of all configuration options).

If left unspecified, Ruff&#039;s default configuration is equivalent to the following `ruff.toml` file:

```toml
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    &quot;.bzr&quot;,
    &quot;.direnv&quot;,
    &quot;.eggs&quot;,
    &quot;.git&quot;,
    &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;,
    &quot;.hg&quot;,
    &quot;.ipynb_checkpoints&quot;,
    &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.nox&quot;,
    &quot;.pants.d&quot;,
    &quot;.pyenv&quot;,
    &quot;.pytest_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.pytype&quot;,
    &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;,
    &quot;.svn&quot;,
    &quot;.tox&quot;,
    &quot;.venv&quot;,
    &quot;.vscode&quot;,
    &quot;__pypackages__&quot;,
    &quot;_build&quot;,
    &quot;buck-out&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;,
    &quot;dist&quot;,
    &quot;node_modules&quot;,
    &quot;site-packages&quot;,
    &quot;venv&quot;,
]

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88
indent-width = 4

# Assume Python 3.9
target-version = &quot;py39&quot;

[lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`)  codes by default.
select = [&quot;E4&quot;, &quot;E7&quot;, &quot;E9&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
ignore = []

# Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = []

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$&quot;

[format]
# Like Black, use double quotes for strings.
quote-style = &quot;double&quot;

# Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs.
indent-style = &quot;space&quot;

# Like Black, respect magic trailing commas.
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false

# Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending.
line-ending = &quot;auto&quot;
```

Note that, in a `pyproject.toml`, each section header should be prefixed with `tool.ruff`. For
example, `[lint]` should be replaced with `[tool.ruff.lint]`.

Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those
related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level:

```shell
ruff check --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all `--config` argument:

```shell
ruff check --config &quot;lint.per-file-ignores = {&#039;some_file.py&#039; = [&#039;F841&#039;]}&quot;
```

To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable
[preview mode](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) by setting `preview = true` in your configuration
file or passing `--preview` on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable
features that may change prior to stabilization.

See `ruff help` for more on Ruff&#039;s top-level commands, or `ruff help check` and `ruff help format`
for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively.

## Rules&lt;a id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin section: Rules --&gt;

**Ruff supports over 800 lint rules**, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule&#039;s origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8&#039;s `F` rules, along with a subset of the `E` rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like `ruff format` or
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

If you&#039;re just getting started with Ruff, **the default rule set is a great place to start**: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.

&lt;!-- End section: Rules --&gt;

Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code

## Acknowledgements&lt;a id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ruff&#039;s linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a &quot;direct&quot; Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We&#039;re grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they&#039;ve provided to the Python community.

Ruff&#039;s formatter is built on a fork of Rome&#039;s [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both API and implementation details from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff&#039;s import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors).

Ruff is released under the MIT license.

&lt;br /&gt;

SQLx is an async, pure Rust&lt;sub&gt;†&lt;/sub&gt; SQL crate featuring compile-time checked queries without a DSL.

-   **Truly Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.

-   **Compile-time checked queries** (if you want). See [SQLx is not an ORM](#sqlx-is-not-an-orm).

-   **Database Agnostic**. Support for [PostgreSQL], [MySQL], [MariaDB], [SQLite].
    -   [MSSQL] was supported prior to version 0.7, but has been removed pending a full rewrite of the driver as part of our [SQLx Pro initiative].

-   **Pure Rust**. The Postgres and MySQL/MariaDB drivers are written in pure Rust using **zero** unsafe&lt;sub&gt;††&lt;/sub&gt; code.

-   **Runtime Agnostic**. Works on different runtimes ([`async-std`] / [`tokio`] / [`actix`]) and TLS backends ([`native-tls`], [`rustls`]).

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;

† The SQLite driver uses the libsqlite3 C library as SQLite is an embedded database (the only way
we could be pure Rust for SQLite is by porting _all_ of SQLite to Rust).

†† SQLx uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` unless the `sqlite` feature is enabled.
The SQLite driver directly invokes the SQLite3 API via `libsqlite3-sys`, which requires `unsafe`.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

---

-   Cross-platform. Being native Rust, SQLx will compile anywhere Rust is supported.

-   Built-in connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool`.

-   Row streaming. Data is read asynchronously from the database and decoded on demand.

-   Automatic statement preparation and caching. When using the high-level query API (`sqlx::query`), statements are
    prepared and cached per connection.

-   Simple (unprepared) query execution including fetching results into the same `Row` types used by
    the high-level API. Supports batch execution and returns results from all statements.

-   Transport Layer Security (TLS) where supported ([MySQL], [MariaDB] and [PostgreSQL]).

-   Asynchronous notifications using `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` for [PostgreSQL].

-   Nested transactions with support for save points.

-   `Any` database driver for changing the database driver at runtime. An `AnyPool` connects to the driver indicated by the URL scheme.

## Install

SQLx is compatible with the [`async-std`], [`tokio`], and [`actix`] runtimes; and, the [`native-tls`] and [`rustls`] TLS backends. When adding the dependency, you must choose a runtime feature that is `runtime` + `tls`.

#### Cargo Feature Flags

For backward-compatibility reasons, the runtime and TLS features can either be chosen together as a single feature,
or separately.

For forward compatibility, you should use the separate runtime and TLS features as the combination features may
be removed in the future.

-   `runtime-async-std`: Use the `async-std` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-async-std-native-tls`: Use the `async-std` runtime and `native-tls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-async-std-rustls`: Use the `async-std` runtime and `rustls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-tokio`: Use the `tokio` runtime without enabling a TLS backend.

-   `runtime-tokio-native-tls`: Use the `tokio` runtime and `native-tls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

-   `runtime-tokio-rustls`: Use the `tokio` runtime and `rustls` TLS backend (SOFT-DEPRECATED).

    - Actix-web is fully compatible with Tokio and so a separate runtime feature is no longer needed.

-   `tls-native-tls`: Use the `native-tls` TLS backend (OpenSSL on *nix, SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS).

-   `tls-rustls`: Use the `rustls` TLS backend (cross-platform backend, only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

-   `postgres`: Add support for the Postgres database server.

-   `mysql`: Add support for the MySQL/MariaDB database server.

-   `mssql`: Add support for the MSSQL database server.

-   `sqlite`: Add support for the self-contained [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine with SQLite bundled and statically-linked.

-   `sqlite-unbundled`: The same as above (`sqlite`), but link SQLite from the system instead of the bundled version.
    * Allows updating SQLite independently of SQLx or using forked versions.
    * You must have SQLite installed on the system or provide a path to the library at build time.
       See [the `rusqlite` README](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-on-building-rusqlite-and-libsqlite3-sys) for details.
    * May result in link errors if the SQLite version is too old. Version `3.20.0` or newer is recommended.
    * Can increase build time due to the use of bindgen.

-   `sqlite-preupdate-hook`: enables SQLite&#039;s [preupdate hook](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/preupdate_count.html) API.
    * Exposed as a separate feature because it&#039;s generally not enabled by default.
    * Using this feature with `sqlite-unbundled` may cause linker failures if the system SQLite version does not support it.

-   `any`: Add support for the `Any` database driver, which can proxy to a database driver at runtime.

-   `derive`: Add support for the derive family macros, those are `FromRow`, `Type`, `Encode`, `Decode`.

-   `macros`: Add support for the `query*!` macros, which allows compile-time checked queries.

-   `migrate`: Add support for the migration management and `migrate!` macro, which allow compile-time embedded migrations.

-   `uuid`: Add support for UUID.

-   `chrono`: Add support for date and time types from `chrono`.

-   `time`: Add support for date and time types from `time` crate (alternative to `chrono`, which is preferred by `query!` macro, if both enabled)

-   `bstr`: Add support for `bstr::BString`.

-   `bigdecimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `bigdecimal` crate.

-   `rust_decimal`: Add support for `NUMERIC` using the `rust_decimal` crate.

-   `ipnet`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnet` crate.

-   `ipnetwork`: Add support for `INET` and `CIDR` (in postgres) using the `ipnetwork` crate.

-   `json`: Add support for `JSON` and `JSONB` (in postgres) using the `serde_json` crate.

-   Offline mode is now always enabled. See [sqlx-cli/README.md][readme-offline].

## SQLx is not an ORM!

SQLx supports **compile-time checked queries**. It does not, however, do this by providing a Rust
API or DSL (domain-specific language) for building queries. Instead, it provides macros that take
regular SQL as input and ensure that it is valid for your database. The way this works is that
SQLx connects to your development DB at compile time to have the database itself verify (and return
some info on) your SQL queries. This has some potentially surprising implications:

- Since SQLx never has to parse the SQL string itself, any syntax that the development DB accepts
  can be used (including things added by database extensions)
- Due to the different amount of information databases let you retrieve about queries, the extent of
  SQL verification you get from the query macros depends on the database

**If you are looking for an (asynchronous) ORM,** you can check out our new [Ecosystem wiki page](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/wiki/Ecosystem#orms)!

## Usage

See the `examples/` folder for more in-depth usage.

### Quickstart

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), sqlx::Error&gt; {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&quot;postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test&quot;).await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as(&quot;SELECT $1&quot;)
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&amp;pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```


### Connecting

A single connection can be established using any of the database connection types and calling `connect()`.

```rust
use sqlx::Connection;

let conn = SqliteConnection::connect(&quot;sqlite::memory:&quot;).await?;
```

Generally, you will want to instead create a connection pool (`sqlx::Pool`) for the application to
regulate how many server-side connections it&#039;s using.

```rust
let pool = MySqlPool::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database&quot;).await?;
```

### Querying

In SQL, queries can be separated into prepared (parameterized) or unprepared (simple). Prepared queries have their
query plan _cached_, use a binary mode of communication (lower bandwidth and faster decoding), and utilize parameters
to avoid SQL injection. Unprepared queries are simple and intended only for use where a prepared statement
will not work, such as various database commands (e.g., `PRAGMA` or `SET` or `BEGIN`).

SQLx supports all operations with both types of queries. In SQLx, a `&amp;str` is treated as an unprepared query,
and a `Query` or `QueryAs` struct is treated as a prepared query.

```rust
// low-level, Executor trait
conn.execute(&quot;BEGIN&quot;).await?; // unprepared, simple query
conn.execute(sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;)).await?; // prepared, cached query
```

We should prefer to use the high-level `query` interface whenever possible. To make this easier, there are finalizers
on the type to avoid the need to wrap with an executor.

```rust
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;mut conn).await?;
sqlx::query(&quot;DELETE FROM table&quot;).execute(&amp;pool).await?;
```

The `execute` query finalizer returns the number of affected rows, if any, and drops all received results.
In addition, there are `fetch`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_optional`, and `fetch_all` to receive results.

The `Query` type returned from `sqlx::query` will return `Row&lt;&#039;conn&gt;` from the database. Column values can be accessed
by ordinal or by name with `row.get()`. As the `Row` retains an immutable borrow on the connection, only one
`Row` may exist at a time.

The `fetch` query finalizer returns a stream-like type that iterates through the rows in the result sets.

```rust
// provides `try_next`
use futures::TryStreamExt;
// provides `try_get`
use sqlx::Row;

let mut rows = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;)
    .bind(email)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);

while let Some(row) = rows.try_next().await? {
    // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    let email: &amp;str = row.try_get(&quot;email&quot;)?;
}
```

To assist with mapping the row into a domain type, one of two idioms may be used:

```rust
let mut stream = sqlx::query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users&quot;)
    .map(|row: PgRow| {
        // map the row into a user-defined domain type
    })
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct User { name: String, id: i64 }

let mut stream = sqlx::query_as::&lt;_, User&gt;(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? OR name = ?&quot;)
    .bind(user_email)
    .bind(user_name)
    .fetch(&amp;mut conn);
```

Instead of a stream of results, we can use `fetch_one` or `fetch_optional` to request one required or optional result
from the database.

### Compile-time verification

We can use the macro, `sqlx::query!` to achieve compile-time syntactic and semantic verification of the SQL, with
an output to an anonymous record type where each SQL column is a Rust field (using raw identifiers where needed).

```rust
let countries = sqlx::query!(
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;{ country: String, count: i64 }&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

Differences from `query()`:

-   The input (or bind) parameters must be given all at once (and they are compile-time validated to be
    the right number and the right type).

-   The output type is an anonymous record. In the above example the type would be similar to:

    ```rust
    { country: String, count: i64 }
    ```

-   The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set at build time to a database which it can prepare
    queries against; the database does not have to contain any data but must be the same
    kind (MySQL, Postgres, etc.) and have the same schema as the database you will be connecting to at runtime.

    For convenience, you can use [a `.env` file][dotenv]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to set DATABASE_URL so that you don&#039;t have to pass it every time:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mysql://localhost/my_database
    ```

[dotenv]: https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv#examples

The biggest downside to `query!()` is that the output type cannot be named (due to Rust not
officially supporting anonymous records). To address that, there is a `query_as!()` macro that is
mostly identical except that you can name the output type.

```rust
// no traits are needed
struct Country { country: String, count: i64 }

let countries = sqlx::query_as!(Country,
        &quot;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY country
WHERE organization = ?
        &quot;,
        organization
    )
    .fetch_all(&amp;pool) // -&gt; Vec&lt;Country&gt;
    .await?;

// countries[0].country
// countries[0].count
```

To avoid the need of having a development database around to compile the project even when no
modifications (to the database-accessing parts of the code) are done, you can enable &quot;offline mode&quot;
to cache the results of the SQL query analysis using the `sqlx` command-line tool. See
[sqlx-cli/README.md](./sqlx-cli/README.md#enable-building-in-offline-mode-with-query).

Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like
`cargo check` and `cargo build` can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by
putting the following in your `Cargo.toml` (More information in the
[Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) of The Cargo Book)

```toml
[profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
opt-level = 3
```

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The `dotenv` crate itself appears abandoned as of [December 2021](https://github.com/dotenv-rs/dotenv/issues/74)
so we now use the `dotenvy` crate instead. The file format is the same.

## Safety

This crate uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to ensure everything is implemented in 100% Safe Rust.

If the `sqlite` feature is enabled, this is downgraded to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` on the
`sqlx::sqlite` module. There are several places where we interact with the C SQLite API. We try to document each call for the invariants we&#039;re assuming. We absolutely welcome auditing of, and feedback on, our unsafe code usage.

This crate has several [features] which can be specified in your `Cargo.toml`.

[features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html

Default features:

- `nested_expressions`: functions for working with nested type function such as `array_to_string`
- `compression`: reading files compressed with `xz2`, `bzip2`, `flate2`, and `zstd`
- `crypto_expressions`: cryptographic functions such as `md5` and `sha256`

- `unparser`: enables support to reverse LogicalPlans back into SQL
- `recursive_protection`: uses [recursive](https://docs.rs/recursive/latest/recursive/) for stack overflow protection.

Optional features:

- `avro`: support for reading the [Apache Avro] format
- `backtrace`: include backtrace information in error messages
- `pyarrow`: conversions between PyArrow and DataFusion types
- `serde`: enable arrow-schema&#039;s `serde` feature

[apache avro]: https://avro.apache.org/
[apache parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/

## Rust Version Compatibility Policy

The Rust toolchain releases are tracked at [Rust Versions](https://releases.rs) and follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A Rust toolchain release can be identified
by a version string like `1.80.0`, or more generally `major.minor.patch`.

DataFusion&#039;s supports the last 4 stable Rust minor versions released and any such versions released within the last 4 months.

For example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.

Note: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.

DataFusion enforces MSRV policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&amp;type=code)

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.


&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

`just` is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

This readme is also available as a [book](https://just.systems/man/en/). The
book reflects the latest release, whereas the
[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.md)
reflects latest master.

(中文文档在 [这里](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.中文.md),
快看过来!)

Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax
inspired by `make`:

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/screenshot.png)

You can then run them with `just RECIPE`:

```console
$ just test-all
cc *.c -o main
./test --all
Yay, all your tests passed!
```

`just` has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over `make`:

- `just` is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of
  [`make`&#039;s complexity and idiosyncrasies](#what-are-the-idiosyncrasies-of-make-that-just-avoids).
  No need for `.PHONY` recipes!

- Linux, MacOS, Windows, and other reasonable unices are supported with no
  additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn&#039;t have an `sh`,
  you&#039;ll need to [choose a different shell](#shell).)

- Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along
  with their source context.

- Recipes can accept [command line arguments](#recipe-parameters).

- Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and
  circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.

- `just` [loads `.env` files](#dotenv-settings), making it easy to populate
  environment variables.

- Recipes can be [listed from the command line](#listing-available-recipes).

- Command line completion scripts are
  [available for most popular shells](#shell-completion-scripts).

- Recipes can be written in
  [arbitrary languages](#shebang-recipes), like Python or NodeJS.

- `just` can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that
  contains the `justfile`.

- And [much more](https://just.systems/man/en/)!

always welcome!

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

`just` should run on any system with a reasonable `sh`, including Linux, MacOS,
and the BSDs.

On Windows, `just` works with the `sh` provided by
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com),
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), or
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com).

If you&#039;d rather not install `sh`, you can use the `shell` setting to use the
shell of your choice.

Like PowerShell:

```just
# use PowerShell instead of sh:
set shell := [&quot;powershell.exe&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;]

hello:
  Write-Host &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
```

…or `cmd.exe`:

```just
# use cmd.exe instead of sh:
set shell := [&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;/c&quot;]

list:
  dir
```

You can also set the shell using command-line arguments. For example, to use
PowerShell, launch `just` with `--shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c`.

(PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2
S1 and later, and `cmd.exe` is quite fiddly, so PowerShell is recommended for
most Windows users.)

### Pre-Built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows can be found on
[the releases page](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).

You can use the following command on Linux, MacOS, or Windows to download the
latest release, just replace `DEST` with the directory where you&#039;d like to put
`just`:

```console
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to DEST
```

For example, to install `just` to `~/bin`:

```console
# create ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/bin

# download and extract just to ~/bin/just
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin

# add `~/bin` to the paths that your shell searches for executables
# this line should be added to your shells initialization file,
# e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$HOME/bin&quot;

# just should now be executable
just --help
```

Note that `install.sh` may fail on GitHub Actions, or in other environments
where many machines share IP addresses. `install.sh` calls GitHub APIs in order
to determine the latest version of `just` to install, and those API calls are
rate-limited on a per-IP basis. To make `install.sh` more reliable in such
circumstances, pass a specific tag to install with `--tag`.

[Releases](https://github.com/casey/just/releases) include a `SHA256SUM` file
which can be used to verify the integrity of pre-built binary archives.

To verify a release, download the pre-built binary archive along with the
`SHA256SUM` file and run:

```sh
shasum --algorithm 256 --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
```

### GitHub Actions

`just` can be installed on GitHub Actions in a few ways.

Using package managers pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners on MacOS with
`brew install just`, and on Windows with `choco install just`.

With [extractions/setup-just](https://github.com/extractions/setup-just):

```yaml
- uses: extractions/setup-just@v2
  with:
    just-version: 1.5.0  # optional semver specification, otherwise latest
```

Or with [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action):

```yaml
- uses: taiki-e/install-action@just
```

### Release RSS Feed

An [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of `just` releases is available [here](https://github.com/casey/just/releases.atom).

### Node.js Installation

[just-install](https://npmjs.com/package/just-install) can be used to automate
installation of `just` in Node.js applications.

`just` is a great, more robust alternative to npm scripts. If you want to
include `just` in the dependencies of a Node.js application, `just-install`
will install a local, platform-specific binary as part of the `npm install`
command. This removes the need for every developer to install `just`
independently using one of the processes mentioned above. After installation,
the `just` command will work in npm scripts or with npx. It&#039;s great for teams
who want to make the set up process for their project as easy as possible.

For more information, see the
[just-install README file](https://github.com/brombal/just-install#readme).

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

With the release of version 1.0, `just` features a strong commitment to
backwards compatibility and stability.

Future releases will not introduce backwards incompatible changes that make
existing `justfile`s stop working, or break working invocations of the
command-line interface.

This does not, however, preclude fixing outright bugs, even if doing so might
break `justfiles` that rely on their behavior.

There will never be a `just` 2.0. Any desirable backwards-incompatible changes
will be opt-in on a per-`justfile` basis, so users may migrate at their
leisure.

Features that aren&#039;t yet ready for stabilization are marked as unstable and may
be changed or removed at any time. Using unstable features produces an error by
default, which can be suppressed with by passing the `--unstable` flag,
`set unstable`, or setting the environment variable `JUST_UNSTABLE`, to any
value other than `false`, `0`, or the empty string.

Editor Support
--------------

`justfile` syntax is close enough to `make` that you may want to tell your
editor to use `make` syntax highlighting for `just`.

### Vim and Neovim

Vim version 9.1.1042 or better and Neovim version 0.11 or better support
Justfile syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to
[pbnj](https://github.com/pbnj).

#### `vim-just`

The [vim-just](https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just) plugin provides syntax
highlighting for `justfile`s.

Install it with your favorite package manager, like
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
call plug#begin()

Plug &#039;NoahTheDuke/vim-just&#039;

call plug#end()
```

Or with Vim&#039;s built-in package support:

```console
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
git clone https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just.git
```

#### `tree-sitter-just`

[tree-sitter-just](https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just) is an
[Nvim Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin
for Neovim.

#### Makefile Syntax Highlighting

Vim&#039;s built-in makefile syntax highlighting isn&#039;t perfect for `justfile`s, but
it&#039;s better than nothing. You can put the following in `~/.vim/filetype.vim`:

```vimscript
if exists(&quot;did_load_filetypes&quot;)
  finish
endif

augroup filetypedetect
  au BufNewFile,BufRead justfile setf make
augroup END
```

Or add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on a
per-file basis:

```text
# vim: set ft=make :
```

### Emacs

[just-mode](https://github.com/leon-barrett/just-mode.el) provides syntax
highlighting and automatic indentation of `justfile`s. It is available on
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/) as [just-mode](https://melpa.org/#/just-mode).

[justl](https://github.com/psibi/justl.el) provides commands for executing and
listing recipes.

You can add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on
a per-file basis:

```text
# Local Variables:
# mode: makefile
# End:
```

### Visual Studio Code

An extension for VS Code is [available here](https://github.com/nefrob/vscode-just).

Unmaintained VS Code extensions include
[skellock/vscode-just](https://github.com/skellock/vscode-just) and
[sclu1034/vscode-just](https://github.com/sclu1034/vscode-just).

### JetBrains IDEs

A plugin for JetBrains IDEs by [linux_china](https://github.com/linux-china) is
[available here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18658-just).

### Kakoune

Kakoune supports `justfile` syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to
TeddyDD.

### Helix

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) supports `justfile` syntax highlighting
out-of-the-box since version 23.05.

### Sublime Text

The [Just package](https://github.com/nk9/just_sublime) by
[nk9](https://github.com/nk9) with `just` syntax and some other tools is
available on [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Just).

### Micro

[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) supports Justfile syntax highlighting
out of the box, thanks to [tomodachi94](https://github.com/tomodachi94).

### Zed

The [zed-just](https://github.com/jackTabsCode/zed-just/) extension by
[jackTabsCode](https://github.com/jackTabsCode) is avilable on the
[Zed extensions page](https://zed.dev/extensions?query=just).

### Other Editors

Feel free to send me the commands necessary to get syntax highlighting working
in your editor of choice so that I may include them here.

Quick Start
-----------

See the installation section for how to install `just` on your computer. Try
running `just --version` to make sure that it&#039;s installed correctly.

For an overview of the syntax, check out
[this cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/linux-china/cheat-sheets/justfile/).

Once `just` is installed and working, create a file named `justfile` in the
root of your project with the following contents:

```just
recipe-name:
  echo &#039;This is a recipe!&#039;

# this is a comment
another-recipe:
  @echo &#039;This is another recipe.&#039;
```

When you invoke `just` it looks for file `justfile` in the current directory
and upwards, so you can invoke it from any subdirectory of your project.

The search for a `justfile` is case insensitive, so any case, like `Justfile`,
`JUSTFILE`, or `JuStFiLe`, will work. `just` will also look for files with the
name `.justfile`, in case yo

## Usage

Winit is a window creation and management library. It can create windows and lets you handle
events (for example: the window being resized, a key being pressed, a mouse movement, etc.)
produced by the window.

Winit is designed to be a low-level brick in a hierarchy of libraries. Consequently, in order to
show something on the window you need to use the platform-specific getters provided by winit, or
another library.

## CONTRIBUTING

For contributing guidelines see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## MSRV Policy

This crate&#039;s Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is **1.80**. Changes to
the MSRV will be accompanied by a minor version bump.

As a **tentative** policy, the upper bound of the MSRV is given by the following
formula:

```
min(sid, stable - 3)
```

Where `sid` is the current version of `rustc` provided by [Debian Sid], and
`stable` is the latest stable version of Rust. This bound may be broken in case of a major ecosystem shift or a security vulnerability.

[Debian Sid]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/rustc

An exception is made for the Android platform, where a higher Rust version
must be used for certain Android features. In this case, the MSRV will be
capped at the latest stable version of Rust minus three. This inconsistency is
not reflected in Cargo metadata, as it is not powerful enough to expose this
restriction.

Redox OS is also not covered by this MSRV policy, as it requires a Rust nightly
toolchain to compile.

All crates in the [`rust-windowing`] organizations have the
same MSRV policy.

[`rust-windowing`]: https://github.com/rust-windowing

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GPUI Component

UI components for building fantastic desktop applications using [GPUI](https://gpui.rs).

## Features

- **Richness**: 40+ cross-platform desktop UI components.
- **Native**: Inspired by macOS and Windows controls, combined with shadcn/ui design for a modern experience.
- **Ease of Use**: Stateless `RenderOnce` components, simple and user-friendly.
- **Customizable**: Built-in `Theme` and `ThemeColor`, supporting multi-theme and variable-based configurations.
- **Versatile**: Supports sizes like `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.
- **Flexible Layout**: Dock layout for panel arrangements, resizing, and freeform (Tiles) layouts.
- **High Performance**: Virtualized Table and List components for smooth large-data rendering.
- **Content Rendering**: Native support for Markdown and simple HTML.

## Showcase

Here is the first application: [Longbridge Pro](https://longbridge.com/desktop), built using GPUI Component.

&lt;img width=&quot;1763&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2f4eb7-fd27-4343-b6dc-184465599e99&quot; /&gt;

We built multi-theme support in the application. This feature is not included in GPUI Component itself, but is based on the `Theme` feature, so it&#039;s easy to implement.

## Usage

GPUI and GPUI Component are still in development, so you need to add dependencies by git.

GPUI Component depends on a specific version of `gpui` (kept updated with upstream) to include WebView support.

```toml
gpui = { git = &quot;https://github.com/huacnlee/zed.git&quot;, branch = &quot;webview&quot; }
gpui-component = { git = &quot;https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component.git&quot; }
```

### WebView

&gt; Still early and experimental; there are a lot of limitations.

GPUI Component has a `WebView` element based on [Wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry). This is an optional feature, which you can enable with a feature flag.

```toml
gpui-component = { git = &quot;https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component.git&quot;, features = [&quot;webview&quot;] }
```

More usage examples can be found in the [story](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/tree/main/crates/story) directory.

### Icons

GPUI Component has an `Icon` element, but it does not include SVG files by default.

The example uses [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons, but you can use any icons you like. Just name the SVG files as defined in [IconName](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/ui/src/icon.rs#L86). You can add any icons you need to your project.

## Development

We have a gallery of applications built with GPUI Component.

```bash
cargo run
```

More examples can be found in the `examples` directory. You can run them with `cargo run --example &lt;example_name&gt;`.

Check out [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT) for more details.

## About

`brush` (**B**o(u)rn(e) **RU**sty **SH**ell) is a [POSIX-](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html) and [bash-](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)compatible shell,
implemented in Rust. It&#039;s built and tested on Linux and macOS, with experimental support on Windows. (Its Linux build is fully supported running on Windows via WSL.)

![screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e64d1b9-7e4e-43be-8593-6c1b9607ac52)

`brush` is functional for interactive use as a daily driver! It can execute most `sh` and `bash` scripts we&#039;ve
encountered. Known limitations are tracked with filed issues. Out of an abundance of caution, 
we wouldn&#039;t recommend using it yet in _production_ scenarios in case it doesn&#039;t behave identically
to your existing stable shell. (If you do find any behavioral differences, though, please report them with an
issue!)

Contributions and feedback of all kinds are welcome! For more guidance, please consult our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). For more technical details, please consult the
[documentation](docs/README.md) in this repo.

This project was originally borne out of curiosity and a desire to learn. We&#039;re doing our best to keep that
attitude :).

### License

Available for use and distribution under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

### Try it out!

We don&#039;t publish binary releases of `brush`, but if you have a working `rust` toolchain installed you can simply run:

```bash
cargo install --locked brush-shell
```

This will install the most recently released version of `brush` from `crates.io`. Alternatively, for the latest and
greatest bits, you can clone this repo and execute `cargo run`.

If you don&#039;t have `rust` installed, we recommend installing it via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

(If you *are* interested in having a binary release, then please let us know in the &#039;Discussions&#039; area of this
project or by filing a feature request in &#039;Issues&#039;.)

If you are a Nix user, you can also use the registered version.

```bash
nix run &#039;github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable#brush&#039; -- --version
```

Arch Linux users can install `brush` [from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/brush) with their [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) of choice, e.g.

```bash
paru -S brush
```

When you run `brush`, it should look exactly as `bash` would on your system since it processes `.bashrc` and
other usual configuration. If you&#039;d like to customize the look of `brush` to distinguish it from the other shells
installed on your system, then you can also author a `~/.brushrc` file.

### Known limitations

There are some known gaps in compatibility. Most notably:

* **Some `set` and `shopt` options.**
  The `set` builtin is implemented, as is `set -x` and many frequently used `set`/`shopt` options, but a number aren&#039;t fully implemented. For example, `set -e` will execute but its semantics aren&#039;t applied across execution.

* **Anything tagged with a `TODO` comment or where `error::unimp()` is used to return a &quot;not implemented&quot; error**.
  These aren&#039;t all tracked with GitHub issues right now, but there&#039;s a number of these scattered throughout the code base. Some are indicative of missing functionality that may be straightforward to implement; others may be more complicated.

If you feel so inclined, we&#039;d love contributions toward any of the above, with broadening test coverage, deeper compatibility evaluation, or really any other opportunities you can find to help us make this project better.

## Testing strategy

This project is primarily tested by comparing its behavior with other existing shells, leveraging the latter as test oracles. The integration tests implemented in this repo include [550+ test cases](brush-shell/tests/cases) run on both this shell and an oracle, comparing standard output and exit codes.

For more details, please consult the [reference documentation on integration testing](docs/reference/integration-testing.md).

## Credits

There&#039;s a long list of OSS crates whose shoulders this project rests on. Notably, the following crates are directly relied on for major portions of shell functionality:

* [`reedline`](https://github.com/nushell/reedline) - for readline-like input and interactive usage
* [`clap`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) - command-line parsing, used both by the top-level brush CLI as well as built-in commands
* [`fancy-regex`](https://github.com/fancy-regex/fancy-regex) - relied on for everything regex
* [`tokio`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) - async, well, everything
* [`nix` rust crate](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix) - higher-level APIs for Unix/POSIX system APIs

For testing, performance benchmarking, and other important engineering support, we use and love:

* [`pprof-rs`](https://github.com/tikv/pprof-rs) - for sampling-based CPU profiling
* [`criterion.rs`](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) - for statistics-based benchmarking
* [`bash-completion`](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) - for its completion test suite and general completion support!

## Links: other shell implementations

There are a number of other POSIX-ish shells implemented in a non-C/C++ implementation language. Some inspirational examples include:

* [`nushell`](https://www.nushell.sh/) - modern Rust-implemented shell (which also provides the `reedline` crate we use!)
* [`rusty_bash`](https://github.com/shellgei/rusty_bash)
* [`mvdan/sh`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh)

We&#039;re sure there are plenty more; we&#039;re happy to include links to them as well.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># sudo-rs

A safety oriented and memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.

## Status of this project

Sudo-rs is being developed further; features you might expect from original sudo
may still be unimplemented or not planned. If there is an important one you need,
please request it using the issue tracker. If you encounter any usability bugs,
also please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/issues).
Suspected vulnerabilities can be reported on our [security page](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/security).

An [audit of sudo-rs version 0.2.0](docs/audit/audit-report-sudo-rs.pdf) has been performed in August 2023.
The findings from that audit are addressed in the current version.

Sudo-rs currently is targeted for Linux-based operating systems only; Linux kernel 5.9
or newer is necessary to run sudo-rs.

## Installing sudo-rs

The recommended way to start using `sudo-rs` is via the package manager of your Linux distribution.

### Debian/Ubuntu
If you are running Debian 13 (trixie) or later, or Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) or later, you can use:
```sh
apt-get install sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`. If you want to invoke sudo-rs
via the usual commands `sudo` and `su` instead, prepend `/usr/lib/cargo/bin` to your current `$PATH` variable.

### Fedora

If you are running Fedora 38 or later, you can use:
```sh
dnf install sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux can be installed from the distribution repositories:
```sh
pacman -S sudo-rs
```
This will offer the functionality using the commands `su-rs` and `sudo-rs`.

### Installing our pre-compiled x86-64 binaries

You can also switch to sudo-rs manually by using our pre-compiled tarballs.
We currently only offer these for x86-64 systems.

We recommend installing sudo-rs and su-s in your `/usr/local` hierarchy so it can co-exist with
your existing sudo installation. You can achieve this using the commands:
```sh
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf sudo-VERSION.tar.gz
```
and for su-rs:
```sh
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf su-VERSION.tar.gz
```
This will install sudo-rs and su-rs in `/usr/local/bin` using the usual commands `sudo` and `su`; it
will also install our version of `visudo` in that location.

Of course, if you **don&#039;t** have Todd Miller&#039;s `sudo` installed, you also have to make sure that:

* You manually create a `/etc/sudoers` or `/etc/sudoers-rs` file, this could be as simple as:

      Defaults secure_path=&quot;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin&quot;

      %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

  `sudo-rs` will try to process `/etc/sudoers-rs` exists if it exists, otherwise it will use `/etc/sudoers`.
  For an explanation of the sudoers syntax you can look at the
  [sudoers man page](https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/sudoers.man/).

* (Strongly recommended) You create `/etc/pam.d/sudo` and `/etc/pam.d/sudo-i` files that contain:

      session required pam_limits.so

      @include common-auth
      @include common-account
      @include common-session-noninteractive

  If you don&#039;t do this, either a &quot;fallback&quot; PAM policy will be used or `sudo-rs` will simply refuse to run
  since it cannot initialize PAM. On FreeBSD, you may want to put these files in `/usr/local/etc/pam.d` instead.

### Building from source

Sudo-rs is written in Rust. The minimum required Rust version is 1.70. If your
Linux distribution does not package that version (or a later one), you can always
install the most recent version through [rustup]. You also need the C development
files for PAM (`libpam0g-dev` on Debian, `pam-devel` on Fedora).

On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, use the following command to install the PAM development library:
```
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

On Fedora, CentOS and other Red Hat-based systems, you can use the following command:
```
sudo yum install pam-devel
```

With dependencies installed, building sudo-rs is a simple matter of:
```
cargo build --release
```

This produces a binary `target/release/sudo`. However, this binary must have
the setuid flag set and must be owned by the root user in order to provide any
useful functionality. Consult your operating system manual for details.

Sudo-rs then also needs the configuration files; please follow the installation
suggestions in the previous section.

### Feature flags

#### --features pam-login
By default, sudo-rs will use the PAM service name `sudo`. On Debian and Fedora
systems, it is customary that the name `sudo-i` is used when the `-i / --login`
command line option is used. To get this behaviour, enable the `pam-login`
feature when building:
```
cargo build --release --features pam-login
```
This feature is enabled on our pre-supplied binaries.

#### --features apparmor
sudo-rs has support for selecting AppArmor profile on Linux distributions that
support AppArmor such as Debian and Ubuntu. To enable this feature, build sudo-rs
with apparmor support enabled:
```
cargo build --release --features apparmor
```

This feature is disabled on our pre-supplied binaries.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

## Differences from original sudo

sudo-rs supports less functionality than sudo. Some of this is by design. In
most cases you will get a clear error if you try something that is not
supported (e.g. use a configuration flag or command line option that is not
implemented).

Exceptions to the above, with respect to your `/etc/sudoers` configuration:

* `use_pty` is enabled by default, but can be disabled.
* `env_reset` is ignored --- this is always enabled.
* `visiblepw` is ignored --- this is always disabled.
* `verifypw` is currently ignored; a password is always necessary for `sudo -v`.
* `mail_badpass`, `always_set_home`, `always_query_group_plugin` and
  `match_group_by_gid` are not applicable to our implementation, but ignored for
  compatibility reasons.
* the (NO)PASSWD tag on the &quot;list&quot; pseudocommand will determine whether a password
  is required for the `sudo -U --list` command, instead of `listpw`.

Some other notable restrictions to be aware of:

* Some functionality is not yet supported; in particular `sudoedit` and preventing shell
  escapes using `NOEXEC` and `NOINTERCEPT`.
* Sudo-rs always uses PAM for authentication, so your system must be set up for PAM.
  Sudo-rs will use the `sudo` and `sudo-i` service configuration. This also means
  that resource limits, umasks, etc have to be configured via PAM and not through
  the sudoers file.
* sudo-rs will not include the sendmail support of original sudo.
* The sudoers file must be valid UTF-8.
* To prevent a common configuration mistake in the sudoers file, wildcards
  are not supported in *argument positions* for a command.
  E.g., `%sudoers ALL = /sbin/fsck*` will allow `sudo fsck` and `sudo fsck_exfat` as expected,
  but `%sudoers ALL = /bin/rm *.txt` will not allow an operator to run `sudo rm README.txt`,
  nor `sudo rm -rf /home .txt`, as with original sudo.

If you find a common use case for original sudo missing, please create a feature
request for it in our issue tracker.

## Aim of the project

Our current target is to build a drop-in replacement for all common use cases of
sudo. For the sudoers config syntax this means that we support the default
configuration files of common Linux distributions. Our implementation should support
all commonly used command line options from the original sudo implementation.

Some parts of the original sudo are explicitly not in scope. Sudo has a large
and rich history and some of the features available in the original sudo
implementation are largely unused or only available for legacy platforms. In
order to determine which features make it we both consider whether the feature
is relevant for modern systems, and whether it will receive at very least
decent usage. Finally, of course, a feature should not compromise the safety of
the whole program.

Our `su` implementation is made using the building blocks we created for our
sudo implementation.  It is a suitable replacement for the `su` distributed
by [util-linux].

[util-linux]: https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux

## Future work

While our initial target is a drop-in replacement for most basic use cases of
sudo, our work may evolve beyond that target. We are also looking into
alternative ways to configure sudo without the sudoers config file syntax and to
extract parts of our work in usable crates for other people.

## History

The initial development of sudo-rs was started and funded by the [Internet Security Research Group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/) as part of the [Prossimo project](https://www.memorysafety.org/)

## Acknowledgements

Sudo-rs is an independent implementation, but it incorporates documentation and Rust translations of code from [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/), maintained by Todd C. Miller. We thank Todd and the other sudo contributors for their work.

An independent security audit of sudo-rs was made possible by the [NLNet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/), who also [sponsored](https://nlnet.nl/project/sudo-rs/) work on increased compatibility with the original sudo and the FreeBSD port.

The sudo-rs project would not have existed without the support of its sponsors, a full overview is maintained at https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/privilege-boundary/

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mountpoint for Amazon S3

[![Tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Integration tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, high-throughput file client for [mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/the-inside-story-on-mountpoint-for-amazon-s3-a-high-performance-open-source-file-client/). With Mountpoint for Amazon S3, your applications can access objects stored in Amazon S3 through file operations like `open` and `read`. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 automatically translates these operations into S3 object API calls, giving your applications access to the elastic storage and throughput of Amazon S3 through a file interface.

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is optimized for applications that need high read throughput to large objects, potentially from many clients at once, and to write new objects sequentially from a single client at a time. This means it&#039;s a great fit for applications that use a file interface to:
* read large objects from S3, potentially from many instances concurrently, without downloading them to local storage first
* access only some S3 objects out of a larger data set, but can&#039;t predict which objects in advance
* upload their output to S3 directly, or upload files from local storage with tools like `cp`

but probably not the right fit for applications that:
* use file operations that S3 doesn&#039;t natively support, like directory renaming or symlinks
* make edits to existing files (don&#039;t work on your Git repository or run `vim` in Mountpoint 😄)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 does not implement all the features of a POSIX file system, and there are some differences that may affect compatibility with your application. See [Mountpoint file system behavior](doc/SEMANTICS.md) for a detailed description of Mountpoint for Amazon S3&#039;s behavior and POSIX support and how they could affect your application.
To troubleshoot file operations that may not be supported by Mountpoint, see the [troubleshooting documentation](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Current status

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is generally available! We&#039;re tracking future feature development on the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/84). We&#039;re always interested in feedback on features, performance, and compatibility. Please send feedback by [opening a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new/choose) or adding your input to an existing roadmap issue.

### Notices

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Mountpoint for Amazon S3 v1.4.0, released on January 26, 2024, contains an [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/751) that causes intermittent read failures. We recommend that customers using v1.4.0 upgrade to v1.4.1 or later.

## Getting started

Run these two commands to install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 on your Amazon Linux EC2 instance (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm
    sudo yum install -y ./mount-s3.rpm

On Ubuntu, use these commands instead (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./mount-s3.deb

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Installing Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and other installation options, including the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html) for Kubernetes applications, or building from source.

Once you&#039;ve got Mountpoint for Amazon S3 installed, you can mount your Amazon S3 bucket.
You&#039;ll need valid AWS credentials to access your bucket.
Mountpoint will automatically use credentials from [an IAM role associated with your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html),
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables,
or from [several other sources](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#aws-credentials).

To mount your bucket, run this command,
replacing `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of your bucket
and `/path/to/mount` with the directory you want to mount the bucket to:

    mount-s3 amzn-s3-demo-bucket /path/to/mount

Now you can work with your bucket contents as if they were a local file system:

    ls /path/to/mount
    echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; &gt; /path/to/mount/Data.txt
    cat /path/to/mount/Data.txt

When you&#039;re finished accessing your bucket, you can unmount it (you might need `sudo`):

    umount /path/to/mount

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Configuring Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details on how to configure and use Mountpoint.

### Compatibility with other storage services

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is designed for high-performance access to the Amazon S3 service. While it may be functional against other storage services that use S3-like APIs, we aren&#039;t able to provide support for those use cases, and they may inadvertently break when we make changes to better support Amazon S3. We welcome contributions of minor compatibility fixes or performance improvements for these services if the changes can be tested against Amazon S3.

    `StreamMuxer` API on which almost all other crates depend.

  * `transports/`: Implementations of transport protocols (e.g. TCP) and protocol upgrades
    (e.g. for authenticated encryption, compression, ...) based on the `libp2p-core` `Transport`
    API.

  * `muxers/`: Implementations of the `StreamMuxer` interface of `libp2p-core`,
    e.g. (sub)stream multiplexing protocols on top of (typically TCP) connections.
    Multiplexing protocols are (mandatory) `Transport` upgrades.

  * `swarm/`: The implementation of `libp2p-swarm` building on `libp2p-core`
    with the central interfaces `NetworkBehaviour` and `ConnectionHandler` used
    to implement application protocols (see `protocols/`).

  * `protocols/`: Implementations of application protocols based on the
    `libp2p-swarm` APIs.

  * `misc/`: Utility libraries.

  * `libp2p/examples/`: Worked examples of built-in application protocols (see `protocols/`)
    with common `Transport` configurations.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/bitcoin/)

Supports (or should support)

* De/serialization of Bitcoin protocol network messages
* De/serialization of blocks and transactions
* Script de/serialization
* Private keys and address creation, de/serialization and validation (including full BIP32 support)
* PSBT v0 de/serialization and all but the Input Finalizer role. Use [rust-miniscript](https://docs.rs/miniscript/latest/miniscript/psbt/index.html) to finalize.

For JSONRPC interaction with Bitcoin Core, it is recommended to use
[rust-bitcoincore-rpc](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoincore-rpc).

It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev) to verify the
trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one.

## Known limitations

### Consensus

This library **must not** be used for consensus code (i.e. fully validating blockchain data). It
technically supports doing this, but doing so is very ill-advised because there are many deviations,
known and unknown, between this library and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation. In a
consensus based cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, it is critical that all parties are using the same
rules to validate data, and this library is simply unable to implement the same rules as Core.

Given the complexity of both C++ and Rust, it is unlikely that this will ever be fixed, and there
are no plans to do so. Of course, patches to fix specific consensus incompatibilities are welcome.

### Support for 16-bit pointer sizes

16-bit pointer sizes are not supported, and we can&#039;t promise they will be. If you care about them
please let us know, so we can know how large the interest is and possibly decide to support them.

### Semver compliance

We try hard to maintain strict semver compliance with our releases. This codebase includes some
public functions marked unstable (e.g., `pub fn foo__unstable()`). These functions do not adhere to
semver rules; use them at your own discretion.


## Documentation

Currently can be found on [docs.rs/bitcoin](https://docs.rs/bitcoin/). Patches to add usage examples
and to expand on existing docs would be extremely appreciated.

## Contributing

Contributions are generally welcome. If you intend to make larger changes please discuss them in an
issue before PRing them to avoid duplicate work and architectural mismatches. If you have any
questions or ideas you want to discuss, please join us in
[#bitcoin-rust](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#bitcoin-rust) on
[libera.chat](https://libera.chat).

For more information, please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This library should compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.63.0**.

Use `Cargo-minimal.lock` to build the MSRV by copying to `Cargo.lock` and building.

## External dependencies

We integrate with a few external libraries, most notably `serde`. These
are available via feature flags. To ensure compatibility and MSRV stability, we
provide two lock files as a means of inspecting compatible versions:
`Cargo-minimal.lock` containing minimal versions of dependencies and
`Cargo-recent.lock` containing recent versions of dependencies tested in our CI.

We do not provide any guarantees about the content of these lock files outside
of &quot;our CI didn&#039;t fail with these versions&quot;. Specifically, we do not guarantee
that the committed hashes are free from malware. It is your responsibility to
review them.

## Installing Rust

Rust can be installed using your package manager of choice or [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs). The
former way is considered more secure since it typically doesn&#039;t involve trust in the CA system. But
you should be aware that the version of Rust shipped by your distribution might be out of date.
Generally this isn&#039;t a problem for `rust-bitcoin` since we support much older versions than the
current stable one (see MSRV section).

## Building

The library can be built and tested using [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/):

```
git clone git@github.com:rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin.git
cd rust-bitcoin
cargo build
```

You can run tests with:

```
cargo test
```

Please refer to the [`cargo` documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) for more
detailed instructions.

### No-std support

The `std` cargo feature is enabled by default. To build this project without the Rust standard
library, use the `--no-default-features` flag or set `default-features = false` in your dependency
declaration when adding it to your project.

For embedded device examples, see [`bitcoin/embedded`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/tree/master/bitcoin/embedded)
or [`hashes/embedded`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/tree/master/hashes/embedded).

### Just

We support [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) for running dev workflow commands. Run `just` from
your shell to see a list of available sub-commands.

### Building the docs

We build docs with the nightly toolchain, you may wish to use the following shell alias to check
your documentation changes build correctly.

```
alias build-docs=&#039;RUSTDOCFLAGS=&quot;--cfg docsrs&quot; cargo +nightly rustdoc --features=&quot;$FEATURES&quot; -- -D rustdoc::broken-intra-doc-links&#039;
```

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are available for those interested, along with benchmarks. For project
developers, especially new contributors looking for something to work on, we do:

- Fuzz testing with [`Honggfuzz`](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/honggfuzz-rs)
- Mutation testing with [`cargo-mutants`](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants)
- Code verification with [`Kani`](https://github.com/model-checking/kani)

There are always more tests to write and more bugs to find. PRs are extremely welcomed.
Please consider testing code as a first-class citizen. We definitely do take PRs
improving and cleaning up test code.

### Unit/Integration tests

Run as for any other Rust project `cargo test --all-features`.

### Benchmarks

We use a custom Rust compiler configuration conditional to guard the bench mark code. To run the
bench marks use: `RUSTFLAGS=&#039;--cfg=bench&#039; cargo +nightly bench`.

### Mutation tests

We are doing mutation testing with [cargo-mutants](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants). To run
these tests first install with `cargo install --locked cargo-mutants` then run with `cargo mutants --in-place --no-shuffle`.
Note that running these mutation tests will take on the order of 10&#039;s of minutes.

### Code verification

We have started using [kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani), install with `cargo install --locked kani-verifier`
 (no need to run `cargo kani setup`). Run the tests with `cargo kani`.

## Pull Requests

Every PR needs at least two reviews to get merged. During the review phase, maintainers and
contributors are likely to leave comments and request changes. Please try to address them, otherwise
your PR might get closed without merging after a longer time of inactivity. If your PR isn&#039;t ready
for review yet please mark it by prefixing the title with `WIP: `.

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline requires approval before being run on each MR.

In order to speed up the review process the CI pipeline can be run locally using
[act](https://github.com/nektos/act). The `fuzz` and `Cross` jobs will be skipped when using `act`
due to caching being unsupported at this time. We do not *actively* support `act` but will merge PRs
fixing `act` issues.

### Githooks

To assist devs in catching errors _before_ running CI we provide some githooks. Copy the hooks in `githooks/`
to your githooks folder or run `just githooks-install` to copy them all.

## Policy on Altcoins/Altchains

Since the altcoin landscape includes projects which [frequently appear and disappear, and are poorly
designed anyway](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/alts.pdf) we do not support any altcoins.
Supporting Bitcoin properly is already difficult enough, and we do not want to increase the
maintenance burden and decrease API stability by adding support for other coins.

Our code is public domain so by all means fork it and go wild :)
