A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune&#039;s design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it&#039;s primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/&lt;lang&gt;/` for `indents.scm`.

_Arch is a proxy server designed as a modular edge and AI gateway for agentic apps_&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Arch handles the *pesky low-level work* in building agentic apps — like applying guardrails, clarifying vague user input, routing prompts to the right agent, and unifying access to any LLM. It’s a language and framework friendly infrastructure layer designed to help you build and ship agentic apps faster.

AI demos are easy to build. But past the thrill of a quick hack, you are left building, maintaining and scaling low-level plumbing code for agents that slows down AI innovation. For example:

- You want to build specialized agents, but get stuck building **routing and handoff** code.
- You want use new LLMs, but struggle to **quickly and safely add LLMs** without writing integration code.
- You&#039;re bogged down with prompt engineering work to **clarify user intent and validate inputs**.
- You&#039;re wasting cycles choosing and integrating code for **observability** instead of it happening transparently.

With Arch, you can move faster by focusing on higher-level objectives in a language and framework agnostic way. **Arch** was built by the contributors of [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

&gt;Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems to improve speed and accuracy for common agentic scenarios  – all outside core application logic.*

**Core Features**:

  - `🚦 Routing to Agents`. Engineered with purpose-built [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-function-66f209a693ea8df14317ad68) for fast (&lt;100ms) agent routing and hand-off scenarios
  - `🔗 Routing to LLMs`: Unify access and routing to any LLM, including dynamic routing via [preference policies](#Preference-based-Routing).
  - `⛨ Guardrails`: Centrally configure and prevent harmful outcomes and ensure safe user interactions
  - `⚡ Tools Use`: For common agentic scenarios let Arch instantly clarify and convert prompts to tools/API calls
  - `🕵 Observability`: W3C compatible request tracing and LLM metrics that instantly plugin with popular tools
  - `🧱 Built on Envoy`: Arch runs alongside app servers as a containerized process, and builds on top of [Envoy&#039;s](https://envoyproxy.io) proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.

**Jump to our [docs](https://docs.archgw.com)** to learn how you can use Arch to improve the speed, security and personalization of your GenAI apps.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Today, the function calling LLM (Arch-Function) designed for the agentic and RAG scenarios is hosted free of charge in the US-central region. To offer consistent latencies and throughput, and to manage our expenses, we will enable access to the hosted version via developers keys soon, and give you the option to run that LLM locally. For more details see this issue [#258](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw/issues/258)

## Contact
To get in touch with us, please join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc). We will be monitoring that actively and offering support there.

## Demos

* [Sample App: Network Operator Agent](demos/samples_python/network_switch_operator_agent/README.md) - A simple network device switch operator agent that can retrive device statistics and reboot them.
* [User Case: Connecting to SaaS APIs](demos/use_cases/spotify_bearer_auth) - Connect 3rd party SaaS APIs to your agentic chat experience.

## Quickstart

Follow this quickstart guide to use arch gateway to build a simple AI agent. Laster in the section we will see how you can Arch Gateway to manage access keys, provide unified access to upstream LLMs and to provide e2e observability.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. [Docker System](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (v24)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.29)
3. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.12)

Arch&#039;s CLI allows you to manage and interact with the Arch gateway efficiently. To install the CLI, simply run the following command:

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; We recommend that developers create a new Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies before installing Arch. This ensures that archgw and its dependencies do not interfere with other packages on your system.

```console
$ python3.12 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install archgw==0.3.4
```

### Build Agentic Apps with Arch Gateway

In following quickstart we will show you how easy it is to build AI agent with Arch gateway. We will build a currency exchange agent using following simple steps. For this demo we will use `https://api.frankfurter.dev/` to fetch latest price for currencies and assume USD as base currency.

#### Step 1. Create arch config file

Create `arch_config.yaml` file with following content,

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  ingress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 10000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    model: openai/gpt-4o

system_prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant.

prompt_guards:
  input_guards:
    jailbreak:
      on_exception:
        message: Looks like you&#039;re curious about my abilities, but I can only provide assistance for currency exchange.

prompt_targets:
  - name: currency_exchange
    description: Get currency exchange rate from USD to other currencies
    parameters:
      - name: currency_symbol
        description: the currency that needs conversion
        required: true
        type: str
        in_path: true
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/latest?base=USD&amp;symbols={currency_symbol}
    system_prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant. Show me the currency symbol you want to convert from USD.

  - name: get_supported_currencies
    description: Get list of supported currencies for conversion
    endpoint:
      name: frankfurther_api
      path: /v1/currencies

endpoints:
  frankfurther_api:
    endpoint: api.frankfurter.dev:443
    protocol: https
```

#### Step 2. Start arch gateway with currency conversion config

```sh

$ archgw up arch_config.yaml
2024-12-05 16:56:27,979 - cli.main - INFO - Starting archgw cli version: 0.3.4
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.utils - INFO - Schema validation successful!
2024-12-05 16:56:28,485 - cli.main - INFO - Starting arch model server and arch gateway
2024-12-05 16:56:51,647 - cli.core - INFO - Container is healthy!
```

Once the gateway is up you can start interacting with at port 10000 using openai chat completion API.

Some of the sample queries you can ask could be `what is currency rate for gbp?` or `show me list of currencies for conversion`.

#### Step 3. Interacting with gateway using curl command

Here is a sample curl command you can use to interact,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;what is exchange rate for gbp&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;As of the date provided in your context, December 5, 2024, the exchange rate for GBP (British Pound) from USD (United States Dollar) is 0.78558. This means that 1 USD is equivalent to 0.78558 GBP.&quot;

```

And to get list of supported currencies,

```bash
$ curl --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  --data &#039;{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;: &quot;show me list of currencies that are supported for conversion&quot;}], &quot;model&quot;: &quot;none&quot;}&#039; \
  http://localhost:10000/v1/chat/completions | jq &quot;.choices[0].message.content&quot;

&quot;Here is a list of the currencies that are supported for conversion from USD, along with their symbols:\n\n1. AUD - Australian Dollar\n2. BGN - Bulgarian Lev\n3. BRL - Brazilian Real\n4. CAD - Canadian Dollar\n5. CHF - Swiss Franc\n6. CNY - Chinese Renminbi Yuan\n7. CZK - Czech Koruna\n8. DKK - Danish Krone\n9. EUR - Euro\n10. GBP - British Pound\n11. HKD - Hong Kong Dollar\n12. HUF - Hungarian Forint\n13. IDR - Indonesian Rupiah\n14. ILS - Israeli New Sheqel\n15. INR - Indian Rupee\n16. ISK - Icelandic Króna\n17. JPY - Japanese Yen\n18. KRW - South Korean Won\n19. MXN - Mexican Peso\n20. MYR - Malaysian Ringgit\n21. NOK - Norwegian Krone\n22. NZD - New Zealand Dollar\n23. PHP - Philippine Peso\n24. PLN - Polish Złoty\n25. RON - Romanian Leu\n26. SEK - Swedish Krona\n27. SGD - Singapore Dollar\n28. THB - Thai Baht\n29. TRY - Turkish Lira\n30. USD - United States Dollar\n31. ZAR - South African Rand\n\nIf you want to convert USD to any of these currencies, you can select the one you are interested in.&quot;

```

### Use Arch as a LLM Router
Arch supports two primary routing strategies for LLMs: model-based routing and preference-based routing.

#### Model-based Routing
Model-based routing allows you to configure static model names for routing. This is useful when you always want to use a specific model for certain tasks, or manually swap between models. Below an example configuration for model-based routing, and you can follow our [usage guide](demos/use_cases/README.md) on how to get working.

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  egress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 12000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    default: true

  - access_key: $MISTRAL_API_KEY
    model: mistral/mistral-3b-latest
```

#### Preference-based Routing
Preference-based routing is designed for more dynamic and intelligent selection of models. Instead of static model names, you write plain-language routing policies that describe the type of task or preference — for example:

```yaml
version: v0.1.0

listeners:
  egress_traffic:
    address: 0.0.0.0
    port: 12000
    message_format: openai
    timeout: 30s

llm_providers:
  - model: openai/gpt-4.1
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    default: true
    routing_preferences:
      - name: code generation
        description: generating new code snippets, functions, or boilerplate based on user prompts or requirements

  - model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    routing_preferences:
      - name: code understanding
        description: understand and explain existing code snippets, functions, or libraries
```

Arch uses a lightweight 1.5B autoregressive model to map prompts (and conversation context) to these policies. This approach adapts to intent drift, supports multi-turn conversations, and avoids the brittleness of embedding-based classifiers or manual if/else chains. No retraining is required when adding new models or updating policies — routing is governed entirely by human-readable rules. You can learn more about the design, benchmarks, and methodology behind preference-based routing in our paper:

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## [Observability](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html)
Arch is designed to support best-in class observability by supporting open standards. Please read our [docs](https://docs.archgw.com/guides/observability/observability.html) on observability for more details on tracing, metrics, and logs. The screenshot below is from our integration with Signoz (among others)

![alt text](docs/source/_static/img/tracing.png)

## Debugging

When debugging issues / errors application logs and access logs provide key information to give you more context on whats going on with the system. Arch gateway runs in info log level and following is a typical output you could see in a typical interaction between developer and arch gateway,

```
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground

Log level can be changed to debug to get more details. To enable debug logs edit (supervisord.conf)[arch/supervisord.conf], change the log level `--component-log-level wasm:info` to `--component-log-level wasm:debug`. And after that you need to rebuild docker image and restart the arch gateway using following set of commands,

```
# make sure you are at the root of the repo
$ archgw build
# go to your service that has arch_config.yaml file and issue following command,
$ archgw up --service archgw --foreground
```

[English] | [简体中文]


Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records
additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and
_fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin
server.




&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animated&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;exit code, duration, time and command shown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





As well as the search UI, it can do things like this:

```
# search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday
atuin search --exit 0 --after &quot;yesterday 3pm&quot; make
```

You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don&#039;t use sync
at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn&#039;t access your data even if
I wanted to. And I **really** don&#039;t want to.

## Features

- rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
- store shell history in a sqlite database
- back up and sync **encrypted** shell history
- the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
- log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
- calculate statistics such as &quot;most used command&quot;
- old history file is not replaced
- quick-jump to previous items with &lt;kbd&gt;Alt-\&lt;num\&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
- switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally
- enter to execute a command, tab to edit

- bash
- fish
- nushell
- xonsh

## Community

### Forum

Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: https://forum.atuin.sh/

### Discord

Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here](https://discord.gg/jR3tfchVvW)

# Quickstart

This will sign you up for the Atuin Cloud sync server. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

Read more in the [docs](https://docs.atuin.sh) for an offline setup, self hosted server, and more.

```
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://setup.atuin.sh | sh

atuin register -u &lt;USERNAME&gt; -e &lt;EMAIL&gt;
atuin import auto
atuin sync
```

Then restart your shell!

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but
&gt; `bash-preexec` has limitations.  For details, please see the
&gt; [Bash](https://docs.atuin.sh/guide/installation/#installing-the-shell-plugin)
&gt; section of the shell plugin documentation.

# Security

If you find any security issues, we&#039;d appreciate it if you could alert ellie@atuin.sh

[ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is a modern Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. Built for real-time, update-heavy workloads.

## Get Started

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.paradedb.com) to get started. You&#039;ll also find our [architecture](https://docs.paradedb.com/welcome/architecture)
docs and [public roadmap](https://docs.paradedb.com/welcome/roadmap) there.

## Deploying ParadeDB

ParadeDB and its extensions can be deployed in one of two ways:

- Docker image based on [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) ([see deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/aws))
- Kubernetes Helm chart based on [CloudNativePG](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg) ([see deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/helm))

For more information, including enterprise features and support, please [contact us by email](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

### Extensions

You can find prebuilt binaries for the ParadeDB Postgres extensions on Debian 11, 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9, and macOS 14 (Sonoma) and 15 (Sequoia) for Postgres 14+ in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest).

ParadeDB supports all versions supported by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, which includes PostgreSQL 14+, and you can compile the extensions for other versions of Postgres by following the instructions in the respective extension&#039;s README.

### Docker Image

To quickly get a ParadeDB instance up and running, simply pull and run the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker run --name paradedb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password paradedb/paradedb
```

This will start a ParadeDB instance with default user `postgres` and password `password`. You can then connect to the database using `psql`:

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U postgres
```

To install ParadeDB locally or on-premise, we recommend using our `docker-compose.yml` file. Alternatively, you can pass the appropriate environment variables to the `docker run` command, replacing the &lt;&gt; with your desired values:

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=&lt;user&gt; \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=&lt;password&gt; \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=&lt;dbname&gt; \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

This will start a ParadeDB instance with non-root user `&lt;user&gt;` and password `&lt;password&gt;`. The `-v` flag enables your ParadeDB data to persist across restarts in a Docker volume named `paradedb_data`.

You can then connect to the database using `psql`:

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U &lt;user&gt; -d &lt;dbname&gt; -p 5432 -W
```

### Helm Chart

ParadeDB is also available for Kubernetes via our Helm chart. You can find our Helm chart in the [ParadeDB Helm Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/paradedb/charts) or download it directly from [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paradedb/paradedb).

### ParadeDB Cloud

At the moment, ParadeDB is not available as a managed cloud service. If you are interested in a ParadeDB Cloud service, please let us know by joining our [waitlist](https://form.typeform.com/to/jHkLmIzx).

# Boundless

This repository contains the core primitives for Boundless.

&gt; **Note:** If you are a builder looking to build an application on Boundless, you should start with the [Boundless Foundry Template](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless-foundry-template) and the [Boundless Builder Docs](https://docs.beboundless.xyz/developers/quick-start).

&gt; **Note:** If you are a prover looking to get started, please refer to the [Boundless Prover Quick Start Guide](https://docs.beboundless.xyz/provers/quick-start).

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as a monorepo and contains Rust crates and Solidity contracts. Some key components:

- **Boundless Core Contracts**: The core smart contracts for Boundless. [./contracts](./contracts)
- **Boundless SDK**: Rust SDK for interacting with Boundless. [./crates/boundless-market](./crates/boundless-market)
- **Boundless CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with Boundless. [./crates/boundless-cli](./crates/boundless-cli)
- **Boundless Broker**: Our sample prover implementation. [./crates/broker](./crates/broker)
- **Boundless zkVM Guests**: The zkVM guests required for generating proofs on Boundless. [./crates/guest](./crates/guest) and [./crates/assessor](./crates/assessor)

## Developing

If you don&#039;t already have Rust installed, start by [installing Rust and rustup](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Then download the RISC Zero toolchain and install it using rzup:

```sh
curl -L https://risczero.com/install | bash
```

Next we can install the RISC Zero toolchain by running rzup install:

```sh
rzup install
```

You can verify the installation was successful by running:

```sh
cargo risczero --version
```

If you don&#039;t already have Forge installed, you can install it using Foundry:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

To build the Solidity contracts, run:

```sh
forge build
```

To build the Rust crates, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

## Documentation

You can find the documentation in the [documentation](./documentation) folder.

To build it and serve it locally, run the following commands:

```sh
bun install
bun run docs
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

**Burn is a next generation Deep Learning Framework that doesn&#039;t compromise on &lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, efficiency and portability.**

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

## Performance

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-blazingly-fast.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Because we believe the goal of a deep learning framework is to convert computation into useful
intelligence, we have made performance a core pillar of Burn. We strive to achieve top efficiency by
leveraging multiple optimization techniques described below.

**Click on each section for more details** 👇

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel fusion 💥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Using Burn means having your models optimized on any backend. When possible, we provide a way to
automatically and dynamically create custom kernels that minimize data relocation between different
memory spaces, extremely useful when moving memory is the bottleneck.

As an example, you could write your own GELU activation function with the high level tensor api (see
Rust code snippet below).

```rust
fn gelu_custom&lt;B: Backend, const D: usize&gt;(x: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt; Tensor&lt;B, D&gt; {
    let x = x.clone() * ((x / SQRT_2).erf() + 1);
    x / 2
}
```

Then, at runtime, a custom low-level kernel will be automatically created for your specific
implementation and will rival a handcrafted GPU implementation. The kernel consists of about 60
lines of WGSL [WebGPU Shading Language](&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/&quot;),
an extremely verbose lower level shader language you probably don&#039;t want to program your deep
learning models in!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Asynchronous execution ❤️‍🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For [first-party backends](#backends), an asynchronous execution style
is used, which allows to perform various optimizations, such as the previously mentioned automatic
kernel fusion.

Asynchronous execution also ensures that the normal execution of the framework does not block the
model computations, which implies that the framework overhead won&#039;t impact the speed of execution
significantly. Conversely, the intense computations in the model do not interfere with the
responsiveness of the framework. For more information about our asynchronous backends, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Thread-safe building blocks 🦞
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn emphasizes thread safety by leveraging the
[ownership system of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).
With Burn, each module is the owner of its weights. It is therefore possible to send a module to
another thread for computing the gradients, then send the gradients to the main thread that can
aggregate them, and _voilà_, you get multi-device training.

This is a very different approach from what PyTorch does, where backpropagation actually mutates the
_grad_ attribute of each tensor parameter. This is not a thread-safe operation and therefore
requires lower level synchronization primitives, see
[distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html) for reference. Note that
this is still very fast, but not compatible across different backends and quite hard to implement.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Intelligent memory management 🦀
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

One of the main roles of a deep learning framework is to reduce the amount of memory necessary to
run models. The naive way of handling memory is that each tensor has its own memory space, which is
allocated when the tensor is created then deallocated as the tensor gets out of scope. However,
allocating and deallocating data is very costly, so a memory pool is often required to achieve good
throughput. Burn offers an infrastructure that allows for easily creating and selecting memory
management strategies for backends. For more details on memory management in Burn, see
[this blog post](https://burn.dev/blog/creating-high-performance-asynchronous-backends-with-burn-compute).

Another very important memory optimization of Burn is that we keep track of when a tensor can be
mutated in-place just by using the ownership system well. Even though it is a rather small memory
optimization on its own, it adds up considerably when training or running inference with larger
models and contributes to reduce the memory usage even more. For more information, see
[this blog post about tensor handling](https://burn.dev/blog/burn-rusty-approach-to-tensor-handling).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Automatic kernel selection 🎯
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A good deep learning framework should ensure that models run smoothly on all hardware. However, not
all hardware share the same behavior in terms of execution speed. For instance, a matrix
multiplication kernel can be launched with many different parameters, which are highly sensitive to
the size of the matrices and the hardware. Using the wrong configuration could reduce the speed of
execution by a large factor (10 times or even more in extreme cases), so choosing the right kernels
becomes a priority.

With our home-made backends, we run benchmarks automatically and choose the best configuration for
the current hardware and matrix sizes with a reasonable caching strategy.

This adds a small overhead by increasing the warmup execution time, but stabilizes quickly after a
few forward and backward passes, saving lots of time in the long run. Note that this feature isn&#039;t
mandatory, and can be disabled when cold starts are a priority over optimized throughput.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Hardware specific features 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is no secret that deep learning is mostly relying on matrix multiplication as its core operation,
since this is how fully-connected neural networks are modeled.

More and more, hardware manufacturers optimize their chips specifically for matrix multiplication
workloads. For instance, Nvidia has its _Tensor Cores_ and today most cellphones have AI specialized
chips. As of this moment, we support Tensor Cores with our LibTorch, Candle, CUDA, Metal and WGPU/SPIR-V
backends, but not other accelerators yet. We hope
[this issue](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4195) gets resolved at some point to bring
support to our WGPU backend.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Custom Backend Extension 🎒
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn aims to be the most flexible deep learning framework. While it&#039;s crucial to maintain
compatibility with a wide variety of backends, Burn also provides the ability to extend the
functionalities of a backend implementation to suit your personal modeling requirements.

This versatility is advantageous in numerous ways, such as supporting custom operations like flash
attention or manually writing your own kernel for a specific backend to enhance performance. See
[this section](https://burn.dev/burn-book/advanced/backend-extension/index.html) in the Burn Book 🔥
for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Backend

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/backend-chip.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

Burn strives to be as fast as possible on as many hardwares as possible, with robust implementations.
We believe this flexibility is crucial for modern needs where you may train your models in the cloud,
then deploy on customer hardwares, which vary from user to user.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Supported Backends**

| Backend  | Devices                      | Class       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| CUDA     | NVIDIA GPUs                  | First-Party |
| ROCm     | AMD GPUs                     | First-Party |
| Metal    | Apple GPUs                   | First-Party |
| Vulkan   | Most GPUs on Linux &amp; Windows | First-Party |
| Wgpu     | Most GPUs                    | First-Party |
| NdArray  | Most CPUs                    | Third-Party |
| LibTorch | Most GPUs &amp; CPUs             | Third-Party |
| Candle   | Nvidia, Apple GPUs &amp; CPUs    | Third-Party |

&lt;br /&gt;

Compared to other frameworks, Burn has a very different approach to supporting many backends. By
design, most code is generic over the Backend trait, which allows us to build Burn with swappable
backends. This makes composing backend possible, augmenting them with additional functionalities
such as autodifferentiation and automatic kernel fusion.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Autodiff: Backend decorator that brings backpropagation to any backend 🔄
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Contrary to the aforementioned backends, Autodiff is actually a backend _decorator_. This means that
it cannot exist by itself; it must encapsulate another backend.

The simple act of wrapping a base backend with Autodiff transparently equips it with
autodifferentiation support, making it possible to call backward on your model.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Wgpu&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}
```

Of note, it is impossible to make the mistake of calling backward on a model that runs on a backend
that does not support autodiff (for inference), as this method is only offered by an Autodiff
backend.

See the [Autodiff Backend README](./crates/burn-autodiff/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Fusion: Backend decorator that brings kernel fusion to all first-party backends
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This backend decorator enhances a backend with kernel fusion, provided that the inner backend
supports it. Note that you can compose this backend with other backend decorators such as Autodiff.
For now, only the WGPU and CUDA backends have support for fused kernels.

```rust
use burn::backend::{Autodiff, Fusion, Wgpu};
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;Fusion&lt;Wgpu&gt;&gt;;

    let x: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default);
    let y: Tensor&lt;Backend, 2&gt; = Tensor::random([32, 32], Distribution::Default).require_grad();

    let tmp = x.clone() + y.clone();
    let tmp = tmp.matmul(x);
    let tmp = tmp.exp();

    let grads = tmp.backward();
    let y_grad = y.grad(&amp;grads).unwrap();
    println!(&quot;{y_grad}&quot;);
}

```

Of note, we plan to implement automatic gradient checkpointing based on compute bound and memory
bound operations, which will work gracefully with the fusion backend to make your code run even
faster during training, see [this issue](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/issues/936).

See the [Fusion Backend README](./crates/burn-fusion/README.md) for more details.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Router (Beta): Backend decorator that composes multiple backends into a single one
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend simplifies hardware operability, if for instance you want to execute some operations on the CPU and other operations on the GPU.

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Distribution, Tensor};
use burn::backend::{
    NdArray, Router, Wgpu, ndarray::NdArrayDevice, router::duo::MultiDevice, wgpu::WgpuDevice,
};

fn main() {
    type Backend = Router&lt;(Wgpu, NdArray)&gt;;

    let device_0 = MultiDevice::B1(WgpuDevice::DiscreteGpu(0));
    let device_1 = MultiDevice::B2(NdArrayDevice::Cpu);

    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_0);
    let tensor_cpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], burn::tensor::Distribution::Default, &amp;device_1);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Remote (Beta): Backend decorator for remote backend execution, useful for distributed computations
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

That backend has two parts, one client and one server.
The client sends tensor operations over the network to a remote compute backend.
You can use any first-party backend as server in a single line of code:

```rust
fn main_server() {
    // Start a server on port 3000.
    burn::server::start::&lt;burn::backend::Cuda&gt;(Default::default(), 3000);
}

fn main_client() {
    // Create a client that communicate with the server on port 3000.
    use burn::backend::{Autodiff, RemoteBackend};

    type Backend = Autodiff&lt;RemoteDevice&gt;;

    let device = RemoteDevice::new(&quot;ws://localhost:3000&quot;);
    let tensor_gpu =
        Tensor::&lt;Backend, 2&gt;::random([3, 3], Distribution::Default, &amp;device);
}

```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

## Training &amp; Inference

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/ember-wall.png&quot; height=&quot;96px&quot;/&gt;

The whole deep learning workflow is made easy with Burn, as you can monitor your training progress
with an ergonomic dashboard, and run inference everywhere from embedded devices to large GPU
clusters.

Burn was built from the ground up with training and inference in mind. It&#039;s also worth noting how
Burn, in comparison to frameworks like PyTorch, simplifies the transition from training to
deployment, eliminating the need for code changes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RM5CQbNQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracel-ai/burn/main/assets/burn-train-tui.png&quot; alt=&quot;Burn Train TUI&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

**Click on the following sections to expand 👇**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Training Dashboard 📈
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see in the previous video (click on the picture!), a new terminal UI dashboard based on
the [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate allows users to follow their training
with ease without having to connect to any external application.

You can visualize your training and validation metrics updating in real-time and analyze the
lifelong progression or recent history of any registered metrics using only the arrow keys. Break
from the training loop without crashing, allowing potential checkpoints to be fully written or
important pieces of code to complete without interruption 🛡

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
ONNX Support 🐫
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-standard format that exports both the architecture
and the weights of a deep learning model.

Burn supports the importation of models that follow the ONNX standard so you can easily port a model
you have written in another framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to Burn to benefit from all the
advantages our framework offers.

Our ONNX support is further described in
[this section of the Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/onnx-model.html).

&gt; **Note**: This crate is in active development and currently supports a
&gt; [limited set of ONNX operators](./crates/burn-import/SUPPORTED-ONNX-OPS.md).

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Importing PyTorch or Safetensors Models 🚚
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can load weights from PyTorch or Safetensors formats directly into your Burn-defined models. This makes it easy to reuse existing models while benefiting from Burn&#039;s performance and deployment features.

Learn more:

- [Import pre-trained PyTorch models into Burn](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/pytorch-model.html)
- [Load models from Safetensors format](https://burn.dev/burn-book/import/safetensors-model.html)

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Inference in the Browser 🌐
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Several of our backends can compile to Web Assembly: Candle and NdArray for CPU, and WGPU for GPU.
This means that you can run inference directly within a browser. We provide several examples of
this:

- [MNIST](./examples/mnist-inference-web) where you can draw digits and a small convnet tries to
  find which one it is! 2️⃣ 7️⃣ 😰
- [Image Classification](./examples/image-classification-web) where you can upload images and
  classify them! 🌄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Embedded: &lt;i&gt;no_std&lt;/i&gt; support ⚙️
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Burn&#039;s core components support [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html). This
means it can run in bare metal environment such as embedded devices without an operating system.

&gt; As of now, only the NdArray backend can be used in a _no_std_ environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

### Benchmarks

To evaluate performance across different backends and track improvements over time, we provide a
dedicated benchmarking suite.

Run and compare benchmarks using [burn-bench](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-bench).

&gt; ⚠️ **Warning**
&gt; When using one of the `wgpu` backends, you may encounter compilation errors related to recursive type evaluation. This is due to complex type nesting within the `wgpu` dependency chain.
&gt; To resolve this issue, add the following line at the top of your `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:
&gt;
&gt; ```rust
&gt; #![recursion_limit = &quot;256&quot;]
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; The default recursion limit (128) is often just below the required depth (typically 130-150) due to deeply nested associated types and trait bounds.

## Getting Started

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Just heard of Burn? You are at the right place! Just continue reading this section and we hope you
can get on board really quickly.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
The Burn Book 🔥
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

To begin working effectively with Burn, it is crucial to understand its key components and
philosophy. This is why we highly recommend new users to read the first sections of
[The Burn Book 🔥](https://burn.dev/burn-book/). It provides detailed examples and explanations
covering every facet of the framework, including building blocks like tensors, modules, and
optimizers, all the way to advanced usage, like coding your own GPU kernels.

&gt; The project is constantly evolving, and we try as much as possible to keep the book up to date
&gt; with new additions. However, we might miss some details sometimes, so if you see something weird,
&gt; let us know! We also gladly accept Pull Requests 😄

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Examples 🙏
&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Let&#039;s start with a code snippet that shows how intuitive the framework is to use! In the following,
we declare a neural network module with some parameters along with its forward pass.

```rust
use burn::nn;
use burn::module::Module;
use burn::tensor::backend::Backend;

#[derive(Module, Debug)]
pub struct PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B: Backend&gt; {
    linear_inner: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    linear_outer: nn::Linear&lt;B&gt;,
    dropout: nn::Dropout,
    gelu: nn::Gelu,
}

impl&lt;B: Backend&gt; PositionWiseFeedForward&lt;B&gt; {
    pub fn forward&lt;const D: usize&gt;(&amp;self, input: Tensor&lt;B, D&gt;) -&gt;

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic —  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) is [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) compliant and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We don&#039;t recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip installs the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

To install it:

```shell
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 --&gt;

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

&lt;div class=&quot;oranda-hide&quot;&gt;

## Documentation
uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.


&lt;!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## Requirements

- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust&#039;s release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

&gt; Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
&gt; and GNU Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named &#039;coreutils&#039;, on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```shell
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don&#039;t want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```shell
cargo build --features &quot;base32 cat echo rm&quot; --no-default-features
```

If you don&#039;t want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named &quot;uu_UTILNAME&quot;. To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```shell
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```shell
make
```

In release mode:

```shell
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039;
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```shell
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo&#039;s _bin_ folder (_e.g._
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```shell
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```shell
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make SKIP_UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```shell
make UTILS=&#039;UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2&#039; install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

To skip installation of completions and manpages:

```shell
make COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install
```

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```shell
cargo run completion &lt;utility&gt; &lt;shell&gt;
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```shell
cargo run completion ls bash &gt; /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```bash
cargo run manpage &lt;utility&gt;
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```bash
cargo run manpage ls &gt; /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```shell
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```shell
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```shell
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```shell
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```shell
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

&lt;!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) --&gt;

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See &lt;https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1&gt; for the main meta bugs

# What is this?

[Zellij](#origin-of-the-name) is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. Similar programs are sometimes called &quot;Terminal Multiplexers&quot;.

Zellij is designed around the philosophy that one must not sacrifice simplicity for power, taking pride in its great experience out of the box as well as the advanced features it places at its users&#039; fingertips.

Zellij is geared toward beginner and power users alike - allowing deep customizability, personal automation through [layouts](https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts.html), true multiplayer collaboration, unique UX features such as floating and stacked panes, and a [plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins.html) allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

You can get started by [installing](https://zellij.dev/documentation/installation.html) Zellij and checking out the [Screencasts &amp; Tutorials](https://zellij.dev/screencasts/).

For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How do I install it?

The easiest way to install Zellij is through a [package for your OS](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_INSTALL.md).

If one is not available for your OS, you could download a prebuilt binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`. If you&#039;d like, we could [automatically choose one for you](#try-zellij-without-installing).

You can also install (compile) with `cargo`:

```
cargo install --locked zellij
```

#### Try Zellij without installing

bash/zsh:
```bash
bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)
```
fish/xonsh:
```bash
bash -c &#039;bash &lt;(curl -L https://zellij.dev/launch)&#039;
```

#### Installing from `main`
Installing Zellij from the `main` branch is not recommended. This branch represents pre-release code, is constantly being worked on and may contain broken or unusable features. In addition, using it may corrupt the cache for future versions, forcing users to clear it before they can use the officially released version.

That being said - no-one will stop you from using it (and bug reports involving new features are greatly appreciated), but please consider using the latest release instead as detailed at the top of this section.

## How do I start a development environment?

* Clone the project
* In the project folder, for debug builds run: `cargo xtask run`
* To run all tests: `cargo xtask test`

For more build commands, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration
For configuring Zellij, please see the [Configuration Documentation](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html).

## About issues in this repository
Issues in this repository, whether open or closed, do not necessarily indicate a problem or a bug in the software. They only indicate that the reporter wanted to communicate their experiences or thoughts to the maintainers. The Zellij maintainers do their best to go over and reply to all issue reports, but unfortunately cannot promise these will always be dealt with or even read. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Roadmap
Presented here is the project roadmap, divided into three main sections.

These are issues that are either being actively worked on or are planned for the near future.

***If you&#039;ll click on the image, you&#039;ll be led to an SVG version of it on the website where you can directly click on every issue***

[![roadmap](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/assets/795598/9c5b573b-20f5-41c6-908b-6b21c5fd456e)](https://zellij.dev/roadmap)

## Origin of the Name
[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij)

Zellij (Arabic: الزليج, romanized: zillīj; also spelled zillij or zellige) is a style of mosaic tilework made from individually hand-chiseled tile pieces. The pieces were typically of different colours and fitted together to form various patterns on the basis of tessellations, most notably elaborate Islamic geometric motifs such as radiating star patterns composed of various polygons. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of architecture in the western Islamic world. It is found in the architecture of Morocco, the architecture of Algeria, early Islamic sites in Tunisia, and in the historic monuments of al-Andalus (in the Iberian Peninsula).

![Annotated Code Example](./screenshots/annotated_code_example.png)

## 🧩 Expressive

**Duality** gives two sides to every concept, leading to rich composability. Whichever angle you take to
tackle a problem, there will likely be ways to express it.
**Par comes with these first-class, structural types:**

_(Dual types are on the same line.)_

- [**Pairs**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/pair.html) (easily extensible to tuples), and [**functions**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/function.html) (naturally curried).
- [**Eithers**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/either.html) (sum types), and [**choices**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/choice.html) (unusual, but powerful dispatchers).
- [**Recursive**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/recursive.html) (finite), and [**iterative**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/iterative.html) (co-recursive, potentially infinite) types, with totality checking.
- [**Universally,**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/forall.html) and [**existentially**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/exists.html) quantified generic functions and values.
- [**Unit,**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/unit.html) and [**continuation.**](https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/continuation.html)

These **orthogonal concepts** combine to give rise to a rich world of types and semantics.

## 🔗 Concurrent

**Automatically concurrent execution.** Everything that can run concurrently, does! Sequential execution is
only enforced by data dependencies. It&#039;s as if everything was `async`, but nothing needs `await`.

Par compiles to [interaction combinators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540197926432/pdf), which is the
basis for the famous [HVM](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM), and the
[Bend](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend) programming language.

**Structured concurrency with session types.** Session types describe concurrent protocols, almost like
finite-state machines, and make sure these are upheld in code. Par needs no special library for these.
Linear types _are_ session types, at least in their full version, which embraces duality.

## 🛡️ Total*

**No crashes.** Runtime exceptions are not supported, except for running out of memory.

**No deadlocks.** Structured concurrency of Par makes deadlocks impossible.

**(Almost) no infinite loops.\*** By default, recursion using `begin`/`loop` is checked for well-foundedness.

**Iterative (corecursive) types** are distinguished from **recursive types**, and enable constructing
potentially unbounded objects, such as infinite sequences, with no danger of infinite loops, or a need
to opt-out of totality.

_\*There is an escape hatch. Some algorithms, especially divide-and-conquer, are difficult or impossible
to implement using easy-to-check well-founded strategies. For those, `unfounded` turns this check
off. Vast majority of code doesn&#039;t need to opt-out of totality checking, it naturally fits its requirements.
Those few parts that need to opt-out are clearly marked with `unfounded`. They are the only places
that can potentially cause infinite loops._

## 📚 Theoretical background

Par is fully based on [linear logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-linear/). It&#039;s an attempt to
bring its expressive power into practice, by interpreting linear logic as _session types_.

In fact, the language itself is based on a little process language, called _CP_, from a paper called
[_&quot;Propositions as Sessions&quot;_](https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/18383989/Wadler_2012_Propositions_as_Sessions.pdf)
by the famous Phil Wadler.

While programming in Par feels just like a programming language, even if an unusual one, its programs
still correspond one-to-one with linear logic proofs.

# RMCP
[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rmcp)](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp)
&lt;!-- ![Release status](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg) --&gt;
&lt;!-- [![docs.rs](todo)](todo) --&gt;
![Coverage](docs/coverage.svg)

An official Rust Model Context Protocol SDK implementation with tokio async runtime.

This repository contains the following crates:

- [rmcp](crates/rmcp): The core crate providing the RMCP protocol implementation( If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp](crates/rmcp/README.md))
- [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros): A procedural macro crate for generating RMCP tool implementations(If you want to get more information, please visit [rmcp-macros](crates/rmcp-macros/README.md))

## Usage

### Import the crate

```toml
rmcp = { version = &quot;0.2.0&quot;, features = [&quot;server&quot;] }
## or dev channel
rmcp = { git = &quot;https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk&quot;, branch = &quot;main&quot; }
```
### Third Dependencies
Basic dependencies:
- [tokio required](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
- [serde required](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)



### Build a Client
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start a client&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use rmcp::{ServiceExt, transport::{TokioChildProcess, ConfigureCommandExt}};
use tokio::process::Command;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = ().serve(TokioChildProcess::new(Command::new(&quot;npx&quot;).configure(|cmd| {
        cmd.arg(&quot;-y&quot;).arg(&quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything&quot;);
    }))?).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### Build a Server

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a transport&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
use tokio::io::{stdin, stdout};
let transport = (stdin(), stdout());
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Build a service&lt;/summary&gt;

You can easily build a service by using [`ServerHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/server.rs) or [`ClientHandler`](crates/rmcp/src/handler/client.rs).

```rust, ignore
let service = common::counter::Counter::new();
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Start the server&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
// this call will finish the initialization process
let server = service.serve(transport).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Interact with the server&lt;/summary&gt;

Once the server is initialized, you can send requests or notifications:

```rust, ignore
// request
let roots = server.list_roots().await?;

// or send notification
server.notify_cancelled(...).await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Waiting for service shutdown&lt;/summary&gt;

```rust, ignore
let quit_reason = server.waiting().await?;
// or cancel it
let quit_reason = server.cancel().await?;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

## Polars: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust using
[Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) as the memory
model.

- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Python

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import polars as pl
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         &quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
...         &quot;fruits&quot;: [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;],
...         &quot;B&quot;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
...         &quot;cars&quot;: [&quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;audi&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;],
...     }
... )

# embarrassingly parallel execution &amp; very expressive query language
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.sort(&quot;fruits&quot;).select(
...     &quot;fruits&quot;,
...     &quot;cars&quot;,
...     pl.lit(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;literal_string_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;B&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;cars&quot;) == &quot;beetle&quot;).sum(),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;B&quot;) &gt; 2).sum().over(&quot;cars&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_cars&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sum().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).reverse().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;rev_A_by_fruits&quot;),

```

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance 🚀🚀

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

`wgpu` is a cross-platform, safe, pure-rust graphics API. It runs natively on Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL; and on top of WebGL2 and WebGPU on wasm.

The API is based on the [WebGPU standard][webgpu]. It serves as the core of the WebGPU integration in Firefox, Servo, and Deno.

## Getting Started

### Play with our Examples

Go to &lt;https://wgpu.rs/examples/&gt; to play with our examples in your browser. Requires a browser supporting WebGPU for the WebGPU examples.

### Rust

Rust examples can be found at [examples](examples). You can run the examples natively with `cargo run --bin wgpu-examples &lt;example&gt;`.

If you are new to wgpu and graphics programming, we recommend starting with https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/.

To run the examples in a browser, run `cargo xtask run-wasm`.
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and you can choose an example to run.
Naturally, in order to display any of the WebGPU based examples, you need to make sure your browser supports it.

### C/C++

To use wgpu in C/C++, you need [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native).

If you are looking for a wgpu C++ tutorial, look at the following:

- https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/

### Others

If you want to use wgpu in other languages, there are many bindings to wgpu-native from languages such as Python, D, Julia, Kotlin, and more. See [the list](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native#bindings).

## Community

## Wiki

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki) that serves as a knowledge base.

## Extension Specifications

While the core of wgpu is based on the WebGPU standard, we also support extensions that allow for features that the standard does not have yet.
For high-level documentation on how to use these extensions, see the individual specifications:

🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 APIs are subject to change and may allow undefined behavior if used incorrectly.

- 🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 [Ray Tracing](./docs/api-specs/ray_tracing.md).
- 🧪EXPERIMENTAL🧪 [Mesh Shading](./docs/api-specs/mesh_shading.md).

## Supported Platforms

| API    | Windows            | Linux/Android      | macOS/iOS          | Web (wasm)         |

🌋 = Requires the [MoltenVK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac) translation layer  
🛠️ = Unsupported, though open to contributions

### Shader Support

wgpu supports shaders in [WGSL](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/), SPIR-V, and GLSL.
Both [HLSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) and [GLSL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)
have compilers to target SPIR-V. All of these shader languages can be used with any backend as we handle all of the conversions. Additionally, support for these shader inputs is not going away.

While WebGPU does not support any shading language other than WGSL, we will automatically convert your
non-WGSL shaders if you&#039;re running on WebGPU.

WGSL is always supported by default, but GLSL and SPIR-V need features enabled to compile in support.

Note that the WGSL specification is still under development,
so the [draft specification][wgsl spec] does not exactly describe what `wgpu` supports.
See [below](#tracking-the-webgpu-and-wgsl-draft-specifications) for details.

To enable SPIR-V shaders, enable the `spirv` feature of wgpu.
To enable GLSL shaders, enable the `glsl` feature of wgpu.

### Angle

[Angle](http://angleproject.org) is a translation layer from GLES to other backends developed by Google.
We support running our GLES3 backend over it in order to reach platforms DX11 support, which aren&#039;t accessible otherwise.
In order to run with Angle, the &quot;angle&quot; feature has to be enabled, and Angle libraries placed in a location visible to the application.
These binaries can be downloaded from [gfbuild-angle](https://github.com/DileSoft/gfbuild-angle) artifacts, [manual compilation](https://github.com/google/angle/blob/main/doc/DevSetup.md) may be required on Macs with Apple silicon.

On Windows, you generally need to copy them into the working directory, in the same directory as the executable, or somewhere in your path.
On Linux, you can point to them using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment.

### MSRV policy

Due to complex dependants, we have two MSRV policies:

- `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types`&#039;s MSRV is **1.82**.
- The rest of the workspace has an MSRV of **1.88**.

It is enforced on CI (in &quot;/.github/workflows/ci.yml&quot;) with the `CORE_MSRV` and `REPO_MSRV` variables.
This version can only be upgraded in breaking releases, though we release a breaking version every three months.

The `naga`, `wgpu-core`, `wgpu-hal`, and `wgpu-types` crates should never
require an MSRV ahead of Firefox&#039;s MSRV for nightly builds, as
determined by the value of `MINIMUM_RUST_VERSION` in
[`python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py`][util].

[util]: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozboot/mozboot/util.py

## Environment Variables

All testing and example infrastructure share the same set of environment variables that determine which Backend/GPU it will run on.

- `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` with a substring of the name of the adapter you want to use (ex. `1080` will match `NVIDIA GeForce 1080ti`).
- `WGPU_BACKEND` with a comma-separated list of the backends you want to use (`vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12`, or `gl`).
- `WGPU_POWER_PREF` with the power preference to choose when a specific adapter name isn&#039;t specified (`high`, `low` or `none`)
- `WGPU_DX12_COMPILER` with the DX12 shader compiler you wish to use (`dxc`, `static-dxc`, or `fxc`). Note that `dxc` requires `dxcompiler.dll` (min v1.8.2502) to be in the working directory, and `static-dxc` requires the `static-dxc` crate feature to be enabled. Otherwise, it will fall back to `fxc`.
- `WGPU_GLES_MINOR_VERSION` with the minor OpenGL ES 3 version number to request (`0`, `1`, `2` or `automatic`).
- `WGPU_ALLOW_UNDERLYING_NONCOMPLIANT_ADAPTER` with a boolean whether non-compliant drivers are enumerated (`0` for false, `1` for true).

When running the CTS, use the variables `DENO_WEBGPU_ADAPTER_NAME`, `DENO_WEBGPU_BACKEND`, `DENO_WEBGPU_POWER_PREFERENCE`.

## Testing

We have multiple methods of testing, each of which tests different qualities about wgpu. We automatically run our tests on CI. The current state of CI testing:

| Platform/Backend | Tests              | Notes                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Windows/DX12     | :heavy_check_mark: | using WARP            |
| Windows/OpenGL   | :heavy_check_mark: | using llvmpipe        |
| MacOS/Metal      | :heavy_check_mark: | using hardware runner |
| Linux/Vulkan     | :heavy_check_mark: | using lavapipe        |
| Linux/OpenGL ES  | :heavy_check_mark: | using llvmpipe        |
| Chrome/WebGL     | :heavy_check_mark: | using swiftshader     |
| Chrome/WebGPU    | :x:                | not set up            |

### Core Test Infrastructure

We use a tool called [`cargo nextest`](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest) to run our tests.
To install it, run `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

To run the test suite:

```
cargo xtask test
```

To run the test suite on WebGL (currently incomplete):

```
cd wgpu
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome --no-default-features --features webgl --workspace
```

This will automatically run the tests using a packaged browser. Remove `--headless` to run the tests with whatever browser you wish at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you are a user and want a way to help contribute to wgpu, we always need more help writing test cases.

### WebGPU Conformance Test Suite

WebGPU includes a Conformance Test Suite to validate that implementations are
working correctly. We run cases from the CTS against wgpu using
[Deno](https://deno.com/). A [default list of enabled
tests](./cts_runner/test.lst) is automatically run on pull requests in CI.

To run the default set of CTS tests locally, run:

```
cargo xtask cts
```

You can also specify a test selector on the command line:

```
cargo xtask cts &#039;webgpu:api,operation,command_buffer,basic:*&#039;
```

Or supply your own test list in a file:

```
cargo xtask cts -f your_tests.lst
```

To find the full list of tests, go to the
[web version of the CTS](https://gpuweb.github.io/cts/standalone/?runnow=0&amp;worker=0&amp;debug=0&amp;q=webgpu:*).

The version of the CTS used by `cargo xtask cts` is specified in
[`cts_runner/revision.txt`](./cts_runner/revision.txt).

## Tracking the WebGPU and WGSL draft specifications

The `wgpu` crate is meant to be an idiomatic Rust translation of the [WebGPU API][webgpu spec].
That specification, along with its shading language, [WGSL][wgsl spec],
are both still in the &quot;Working Draft&quot; phase,
and while the general outlines are stable,
details change frequently.
Until the specification is stabilized, the `wgpu` crate and the version of WGSL it implements
will likely differ from what is specified,
as the implementation catches up.

Exactly which WGSL features `wgpu` supports depends on how you are using it:

- When running as native code, `wgpu` uses the [Naga][naga] crate
  to translate WGSL code into the shading language of your platform&#039;s native GPU API.
  Naga has [a milestone][naga wgsl milestone]
  for catching up to the WGSL specification,
  but in general, there is no up-to-date summary
  of the differences between Naga and the WGSL spec.

- When running in a web browser (by compilation to WebAssembly)
  without the `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` relies on the browser&#039;s own WebGPU implementation.
  WGSL shaders are simply passed through to the browser,
  so that determines which WGSL features you can use.

- When running in a web browser with `wgpu`&#039;s `&quot;webgl&quot;` feature enabled,
  `wgpu` uses Naga to translate WGSL programs into GLSL.
  This uses the same version of Naga as if you were running `wgpu` as native code.

## Getting help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are a couple of channels for support:

* You can use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues) to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.
* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/discussions); if you have general
  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you&#039;re welcome here!
* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)
  for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions
than bug reports, but don&#039;t be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable
using and we&#039;ll work it out.

### A human-friendly alternative to netstat for socket and port monitoring on Linux and macOS.

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The master branch code and readme may include features that are not yet released. For the official, stable version and its documentation, please refer to the [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/somo) page.

## ✨ Highlights:
- pleasing to the eye thanks to a nice table view
- filterable and sortable output
- interactive killing of processes
- JSON and custom formattable output
- from ``netstat -tulpn`` to ``somo -l``
- cross-platform support for Linux and macOS
- you can find all features further down

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./images/somo-example.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ⬇️ Installation:

### Option 1 - Debian:
If you use a Debian OS go to [releases](https://github.com/theopfr/somo/releases) and download the latest .deb release.

### Option 2 - crates.io:
```sh
cargo install somo
```
Most of the time you will want to run this in ``sudo`` mode to see all processes and ports. By default, this is not possible when installed via cargo. But you can create a symlink so the binary can be run as root:
```sh
sudo ln -s ~/.cargo/bin/somo /usr/local/bin/somo
sudo somo   # this works now
```

### Option 3 - GitHub (Development Version):
*Warning:* This is the cutting-edge development version and may be unstable or contain incomplete features. You can install it via cargo directly from the GitHub repository.

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/theopfr/somo
```

### Option 4 - Nix (Development Version):
You can build and use the development version using Nix with Flakes.
```sh
nix build &#039;github:theopfr/somo?dir=nix&#039;
sudo ./result/bin/somo
```

---

## 🏃‍♀️ Running somo:
To run somo just type: 
```sh
sudo somo
```

Somo supports the following features:

### ✨ Filtering:
You can use the following flags to filter based on different attributes:
| filter flag | description | value |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
| ```--tcp, -t``` | filter by TCP connections | - |
| ```--udp, -u``` | filter by UDP connections  | - | 
| ```--proto``` | deprecated – use ``--tcp`` / ``--udp`` instead | ``tcp`` or ``udp`` | 
| ```--port, -p``` | filter by a local port | port number, e.g ``5433`` |
| ```--remote-port``` | filter by a remote port | port number, e.g ``443`` |
| ```--ip``` | filter by a remote IP | IP address e.g ``0.0.0.0`` |
| ```--program``` | filter by a client program | program name e.g ``chrome`` |
| ```--pid``` | filter by a PID | PID number, e.g ``10000`` |
| ```--open, -o``` | filter by open connections | - |
| ```--listen, -l``` | filter by listening connections | - |
| ```--exclude-ipv6``` | don&#039;t list IPv6 connections | - |

### ✨ Compact table view:
To get a smaller, more compact table use the ``--compact, -c`` flag.

&lt;img style=&quot;width: 75%&quot; src=&quot;./images/somo-compact-example.png&quot; /&gt;

### ✨ Process killing:
With the ``--kill, -k`` flag you can choose to kill a process after inspecting the connections using an interactive selection option.

&lt;img style=&quot;width: 75%&quot; src=&quot;./images/somo-kill-example.png&quot; /&gt;

### ✨ JSON and custom output format:
Using the ``--json`` flag you can choose to retrieve the connection data in JSON format. &lt;br /&gt;
You can also define a custom output format using the ``--format`` flag, for example:
```sh
somo --format &quot;PID: {{pid}}, Protocol: {{proto}}, Remote Address: {{remote_address}}&quot; # attributes must be specified in snake_case
```
In the format-string, the attributes have to be specified in *snake_case*.

### ✨ Sorting by columns:
The ``--sort, -s`` flag can be used to sort the table after a specific column ascending. For example:
```sh
somo --sort pid   # column names must be specified in snake_case
```
To get a descending order, you can use the ``--reverse, -r`` flag.

---

## 🐚 Shell Completions:
Somo supports shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and elvish. Choose your shell:

#### Bash
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
somo generate-completions bash &gt; ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/somo
```

#### Zsh
```zsh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions
somo generate-completions zsh &gt; ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions/_somo
echo &#039;fpath=(~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;autoload -U compinit &amp;&amp; compinit&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

#### Fish
```fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
somo generate-completions fish &gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/somo.fish
```

#### Elvish
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/elvish/lib
somo generate-completions elvish &gt; ~/.config/elvish/lib/somo.elv
echo &#039;use somo&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv
```

---

## 🖥️ Platform Support:
Somo currently supports:
- Linux: Full support using the [procfs](https://crates.io/crates/procfs) crate
- macOS: Full support using [netstat2](https://crates.io/crates/netstat2) and [libproc](https://crates.io/crates/libproc/0.13.0) crates

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

Vector is maintained by the Datadog&#039;s [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.
