## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[2]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[2]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

# Rayhunter

![Tests](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/actions/workflows/check-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

Rayhunter is an IMSI Catcher Catcher for the Orbic mobile hotspot.

**THIS CODE IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON IN HIGH RISK SITUATIONS!**

## The Hardware

Rayhunter has been built and tested for the Orbic RC400L mobile hotspot. It may
work on other Orbics and other Linux/Qualcom devices, but this is the only one
we have tested on. You can buy the orbic [using bezos
bucks](https://www.amazon.com/Orbic-Verizon-Hotspot-Connect-Enabled/dp/B08N3CHC4Y),
or on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=orbic+rc400l). Please ensure
that the [Orbic works in your country](#orbic) before buying.

## Setup (macOS, Linux)

1. Download the latest `release.tar` from the [Rayhunter releases page](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/releases)
2. Decompress the `release.tar` archive. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/Downloads/release
    tar -xvf ~/Downloads/release.tar -C ~/Downloads/release
    cd ~/Downloads/release
    ```

3. Turn on the Orbic device by holding the power button for 3 seconds. Plug it into your computer using a USB-C Cable.
4. Run the install script for your operating system:

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The device will restart multiple times over the next few minutes.

    You will know it is done when you see terminal output that says `checking for rayhunter server...success!`

5. Rayhunter should now be running! You can verify this by following the instructions below to [view the web UI](#usage-viewing-the-web-ui). You should also see a green line flash along the top of top the display on the device.

### Installation Notes

* Note: If you are installing from the cloned GitHub repository please see the development instructions below, running `install.sh` from the git tree will not work.
* The install script has only been tested for Linux on the latest version of Ubuntu. If it fails you will need to follow the install steps outlined in **Development** below.
* On macOS if you encounter an error that says &quot;No Orbic device found,&quot; it may because you the &quot;Allow accessories to connect&quot; security setting set to &quot;Ask for approval.&quot; You may need to temporarily change it to &quot;Always&quot; for the script to run. Make sure to change it back to a more secure setting when you&#039;re done.

## Setup (Windows)

* **Windows:** We don&#039;t currently support automated installs on Windows, you will have to follow the instructions in the **Development** section below.

## Updating Rayhunter

Great news: if you&#039;ve successfully installed rayhunter, you already know how to update it! Our update process is identical to the setup process: simply download the latest release and follow the steps in the [setup section](#setup-macos-linux).

## Using Rayhunter

Once installed, Rayhunter will run automatically whenever your Orbic device is running. You&#039;ll see a green line on top of the device&#039;s display to indicate that it&#039;s running and recording. [The line will turn red](#red) once a potential IMSI catcher has been found, until the device is rebooted or a new recording is started through the web UI.

It also serves a web UI that provides some basic controls, such as being able to start/stop recordings, download captures, and view heuristic analyses of captures.

You can access this UI in one of two ways:

1. **Connect over wifi:** Connect your phone/laptop to the Orbic&#039;s 2.4GHz wifi network and visit [http://192.168.1.1:8080](http://192.168.1.1:8080). (Click past your browser warning you about the connection not being secure, Rayhunter doesn&#039;t have HTTPS yet).
    * You can find the wifi network password by going to the Orbic&#039;s menu &gt; 2.4 GHz WIFI Info &gt; Enter &gt; find the 8-character password next to the lock 🔒 icon.
2. **Connect over USB:** Connect the Orbic device to your laptop via USB. Run `adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080`, then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
    * For this you will need to install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your computer, you can copy the version that was downloaded inside the `releases/platform-tools/` folder to somewhere else in your path or you can install it manually.
    * You can find instructions for doing so on your platform [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/#how-to-set-up-adb-on-your-computer), (don&#039;t worry about instructions for installing it on a phone/device yet).
    * On macOS, the easiest way to install ADB is with Homebrew: First [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run `brew install android-platform-tools`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an active SIM card to use Rayhunter?

**It Depends**. Operation of Rayhunter does require the insertion of a SIM card into the device, but whether that SIM card has to be currently active for our tests to work is still under investigation. If you want to use the device as a hotspot in addition to a research device an active plan would of course be necessary, however we have not done enough testing yet to know whether an active subscription is required for detection. If you want to test the device with an inactive SIM card, we would certainly be interested in seeing any data you collect, and especially any runs that trigger an alert!

&lt;a name=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Help, Rayhunter&#039;s line is red! What should I do?

Unfortunately, the circumstances that might lead to a positive cell site simulator (CSS) signal are quite varied, so we don&#039;t have a universal recommendation for how to deal with the a positive signal. Depending on your circumstances and threat model, you may want to turn off your phone until you are out of the area (or put it on airplane mode) and tell your friends to do the same!

If you&#039;ve received a Rayhunter warning and would like to help us with our research, please send your Rayhunter data captures (QMDL and PCAP logs) to us at our [Signal](https://signal.org/) username [**ElectronicFrontierFoundation.90**](https://signal.me/#eu/HZbPPED5LyMkbTxJsG2PtWc2TXxPUR1OxBMcJGLOPeeCDGPuaTpOi5cfGRY6RrGf) with the following information: capture date, capture location, device, device model, and Rayhunter version. If you&#039;re unfamiliar with Signal, feel free to check out our [Security Self Defense guide on it](https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal).

Please note that this file may contain sensitive information such as your IMSI and the unique IDs of cell towers you were near which could be used to ascertain your location at the time.

&lt;a name=&quot;orbic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Does Rayhunter work outside of the US, or on any other devices besides the Orbic RC400L?

**Maybe**. Rayhunter currently only supports the Orbic RC400L, which itself only works in the US and some other countries. [Please check](https://www.frequencycheck.com/countries/) whether the Orbic RC400L supports the right frequency bands for your purpose before buying.

Orbic RC400L Supported Bands
| Frequency | Band          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5G (wideband,midband,nationwide)  | n260/n261, n77, n2/5/48/66 | 
| 4G |    2/4/5/12/13/48/66       |
| Global &amp; Roaming | n257/n78     |
| Wifi 2.4Ghz | b/g/n |
| Wifi 5Ghz | a/ac/ax |
| Wifi 6 | :white_check_mark: |

We have not tested Rayhunter on any other hardware but we would love to expand the supported platforms. We will consider giving official support to any hardware platform that can be bought for around $20-30USD. The Rayhunter daemon should theoretically work on any Linux/Android device that has a qualcomm chip with a `/dev/diag` interface and root access, though our installer script has only been tested with an Orbic. If you get it working on another device, please let us know!

There is work underway to support [TP-Link M7350](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/issues/186) to support more frequency bands and therefore support most of Europe.

### Should I get a locked or unlocked orbic device? What is the difference?

If you want to use a non-Verizon SIM card you will probably need an unlocked device. But it&#039;s not clear how locked the locked devices are nor how to unlock them, we welcome any experimentation and information regarding the use of unlocked devices.

### How do I delete capture files from the Rayhunter device?

You can get a shell on the device by inputting `adb shell` to a terminal with the device connected, you can check if it is detected with `adb devices`.
The capture files are located at */data/rayhunter/qmdl* but you will need root access to modify or delete them. From the adb shell run `/bin/rootshell` and you can now use commands like &#039;rm&#039; as root to modify and delete entries in the */data/rayhunter/qmdl* directory. **Be careful not to delete important files in other directories as you may seriously damage the device**

## Building Rayhunter from source

Building Rayhunter from source, either for development or because the install script doesn&#039;t work on your system, involves a number of external dependencies. Unless you need to do this, we recommend you use our [compiled builds](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/releases).

* Install [nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), which is required to build Rayhunter&#039;s web UI
  * Make sure to build the site with `cd bin/web &amp;&amp; npm run build` before building Rayhunter. If you&#039;re working directly on the frontend, `npm run dev` will allow you to test a local frontend with hot-reloading (use `http://localhost:5173` instead of `http://localhost:8080`).
* Install ADB on your computer using the instructions above, and make sure it&#039;s in your terminal&#039;s PATH
  * You can verify if ADB is in your PATH by running `which adb` in a terminal. If it prints the filepath to where ADB is installed, you&#039;re set! Otherwise, try following one of these guides:
    * [linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/652936/adding-android-sdk-platform-tools-to-path-downloaded-from-umake)
    * [macOS](https://www.repeato.app/setting-up-adb-on-macos-a-step-by-step-guide/)
    * [Windows](https://medium.com/@yadav-ajay/a-step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-adb-path-on-windows-0b833faebf18)
* Install `curl` on your computer to run the install scripts. It is not needed to build binaries.

### Install Rust targets

[Install Rust the usual way](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then,

- install the cross-compilation target for the device rayhunter will run on:
```sh
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
```

- install the statically compiled target for your host machine to build the binary installer [`serial`](./serial).
```sh
# check which toolchain you have installed by default with
rustup show
# now install the correct variant for your host platform, one of:
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

Now you can root your device and install Rayhunter by running `./tools/install-dev.sh`

### If you&#039;re on Windows or can&#039;t run the install scripts

* Root your device on Windows using the instructions here: &lt;https://xdaforums.com/t/resetting-verizon-orbic-speed-rc400l-firmware-flash-kajeet.4334899/#post-87855183&gt;

* Build the web UI using `cd bin/web &amp;&amp; npm run build`

* Push the scripts in `scripts/` to `/etc/init.d` on device and make a directory called `/data/rayhunter` using `adb shell` (and sshell for your root shell if you followed the steps above)

* You also need to copy `config.toml.example` to `/data/rayhunter/config.toml`

* Then run `./make.sh`, which will build the binary, push it over adb, and restart the device. Once it&#039;s restarted, Rayhunter should be running!

# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running a local development environment

Neon can be run on a workstation for small experiments and to test code changes, by
following these instructions.

```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo &#039;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it&#039;s built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project&#039;s directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use &quot;BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s&quot;
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry&gt;=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
&gt; cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
&gt; cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at &#039;127.0.0.1:64000&#039; in &quot;.neon&quot;.
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at &#039;127.0.0.1:5454&#039; in &#039;.neon/safekeepers/sk1&#039;.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
&gt; cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline &#039;de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9&#039; at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres&#039;

# check list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
&gt; cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline &#039;b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601&#039; at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: &#039;main&#039;

# check branches tree
&gt; cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
&gt; cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at &#039;postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres&#039;

# check the new list of running postgres instances
&gt; cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from &#039;main&#039; postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
&gt; psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn&#039;t affect the &#039;main&#039; postgres
&gt; psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
&gt; cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Local Development Control Plane (`neon_local`))](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it&#039;s best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS=&quot;--features=testing&quot; make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=17 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

&gt;[!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you&#039;re using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
&gt; It&#039;s a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
&gt; See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

See also README files in some source directories, and `rustdoc` style documentation comments.

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon&#039;s very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it&#039;s inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

Our mission is to enable secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of
container and function workloads.

Read more about the Firecracker Charter [here](CHARTER.md).

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built
for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based
services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads
in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and
isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the
speed and flexibility of containers.

## Overview

The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses
the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. Firecracker
has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing
functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each
microVM. This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases
hardware utilization. Firecracker has also been integrated in container
runtimes, for example
[Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).

Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and
efficiency of services like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/). Firecracker is open sourced
under [Apache version 2.0](LICENSE).

To read more about Firecracker, check out
[firecracker-microvm.io](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io).

## Getting Started

To get started with Firecracker, download the latest
[release](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) binaries
or build it from source.

You can build Firecracker on any Unix/Linux system that has Docker running (we
use a development container) and `bash` installed, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker
cd firecracker
tools/devtool build
toolchain=&quot;$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl&quot;
```

The Firecracker binary will be placed at
`build/cargo_target/${toolchain}/debug/firecracker`. For more information on
building, testing, and running Firecracker, go to the
[quickstart guide](docs/getting-started.md).

The overall security of Firecracker microVMs, including the ability to meet the
criteria for safe multi-tenant computing, depends on a well configured Linux
host operating system. A configuration that we believe meets this bar is
included in [the production host setup document](docs/prod-host-setup.md).

## Contributing

Firecracker is already running production workloads within AWS, but it&#039;s still
Day 1 on the journey guided by our [mission](CHARTER.md). There&#039;s a lot more to
build and we welcome all contributions.

To contribute to Firecracker, check out the development setup section in the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) and then the Firecracker
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

New Firecracker versions are released via the GitHub repository
[releases](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases) page,
typically every two or three months. A history of changes is recorded in our
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

The Firecracker release policy is detailed [here](docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Design

Firecracker&#039;s overall architecture is described in
[the design document](docs/design.md).

## Features &amp; Capabilities

Firecracker consists of a single micro Virtual Machine Manager process that
exposes an API endpoint to the host once started. The API is
[specified in OpenAPI format](src/firecracker/swagger/firecracker.yaml). Read
more about it in the [API docs](docs/api_requests).

The **API endpoint** can be used to:

- Configure the microvm by:
  - Setting the number of vCPUs (the default is 1).
  - Setting the memory size (the default is 128 MiB).
  - Configuring a [CPU template](docs/cpu_templates/cpu-templates.md).
- Add one or more network interfaces to the microVM.
- Add one or more read-write or read-only disks to the microVM, each represented
  by a file-backed block device.
- Trigger a block device re-scan while the guest is running. This enables the
  guest OS to pick up size changes to the block device&#039;s backing file.
- Change the backing file for a block device, before or after the guest boots.
- Configure rate limiters for virtio devices which can limit the bandwidth,
  operations per second, or both.
- Configure the logging and metric system.
- `[BETA]` Configure the data tree of the guest-facing metadata service. The
  service is only available to the guest if this resource is configured.
- Add a [vsock socket](docs/vsock.md) to the microVM.
- Add a [entropy device](docs/entropy.md) to the microVM.
- Start the microVM using a given kernel image, root file system, and boot
  arguments.
- [x86_64 only] Stop the microVM.

**Built-in Capabilities**:

- Demand fault paging and CPU oversubscription enabled by default.
- Advanced, thread-specific seccomp filters for enhanced security.
- [Jailer](docs/jailer.md) process for starting Firecracker in production
  scenarios; applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops
  privileges.

## Tested platforms

We test all combinations of:

| Instance       | Host OS &amp; Kernel | Guest Rootfs | Guest Kernel |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| c5n.metal      | al2 linux_5.10   | ubuntu 24.04 | linux_5.10   |

| m8g.metal-48xl |                  |              |              |

## Known issues and Limitations

- The `pl031` RTC device on aarch64 does not support interrupts, so guest
  programs which use an RTC alarm (e.g. `hwclock`) will not work.

## Performance

Firecracker&#039;s performance characteristics are listed as part of the
[specification documentation](SPECIFICATION.md). All specifications are a part
of our commitment to supporting container and function workloads in serverless
operational models, and are therefore enforced via continuous integration
testing.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

Union is the hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. It’s based on [Consensus Verification] and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC. It implements [IBC] for compatibility with [Cosmos] chains and connects to EVM chains like [Ethereum], [Berachain (beacon-kit)](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit), [Arbitrum], and more.

The upgradability of contracts on other chains, connections, token configurations, and evolution of the protocol will all be controlled by decentralized governance, aligning the priorities of Union with its users, validators, and operators.

## Quickstart

Install [Nix] to _[reproducibly build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) any component_, and to enter a dev shell with _all dependencies_:

```sh
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

_(Note that some components can only be built on Linux. If you are using macOS, we recommend using [OrbStack] to easily set up a [NixOS] VM within two minutes. Most Union developers use macOS with [OrbStack], and there is no need to install Nix inside of the [NixOS] VM.)_

You can now _reproducibly_ build any of Union&#039;s components from source:

```sh
nix build .#uniond -L
nix build .#voyager -L
nix build .#app -L

# to see all packages, run:
nix flake show
```

The result of whatever you build will be in `result/`

You can now also enter our dev shell, which has all of the dependencies (`cargo`, `rustc`, `node`, `go`, etc.) you need to work on any component:
_(Don&#039;t worry, this will not affect your system outside of this repo)_

```sh
nix develop
```

Run the following to format the entire repo and check your spelling before each PR:

```sh
nix run .#pre-commit -L
```

Check the `#developers` channel on [Union&#039;s discord](https://discord.union.build) if you need any help with this.

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a new Ethereum full node implementation that is focused on being user-friendly, highly modular, as well as being fast and efficient. Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

## Goals

As a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.

More concretely, our goals are:

1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node&#039;s crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node&#039;s database, or &quot;unbundling&quot; the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project&#039;s components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we’ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there&#039;s a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum&#039;s antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you&#039;re working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via &quot;fast sync&quot;. We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable &quot;profiles&quot; for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

More historical context below:
* We released 1.0 &quot;production-ready&quot; stable Reth in June 2024.
    * Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
    * Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.
* We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.
* We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing &quot;history&quot; to be mounted on separate drives.
* We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
* We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.

### Database compatibility

We do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.

Reth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes
a [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.

If you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`
(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you&#039;ve used before.

## For Users

See the [Reth Book](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.

## For Developers

### Using reth as a library

You can use individual crates of reth in your project.

The crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).

For a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

&lt;!--
When updating this, also update:
- clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
--&gt;

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.86.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/04/03/Rust-1.86.0/).

See the book for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source.html).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

&gt; **Note**
&gt;
&gt; Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [book][book].

If the answer is not there:

- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or
- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or
- Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug.yml)

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [&quot;Staged Sync&quot; architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula&#039;s [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Troubleshooting

&lt;details&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;See details&lt;/summary&gt;

### Missing dependencies

Most of the errors that may arise are likely due to your system missing dependencies
required to correctly analyze a network adapter. &lt;br&gt;
Check the [required dependencies page](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/wiki/Required-dependencies) 
for instructions on how to proceed depending on your operating system.

### Rendering problems

In some circumstances, especially if you are running on an old architecture or your graphical drivers are not updated,
the `wgpu` default renderer used by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
may manifest bugs (the interface glitches, color gradients are unsupported, or some icons are completely black). &lt;br&gt;
In these cases you can set an environment variable to switch to the `tiny-skia` renderer,
a CPU-only software renderer that should work properly on every environment:

```sh
ICED_BACKEND=tiny-skia
```

### ***In any case, don&#039;t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/new/choose), and I will do my best to help you!***

&lt;/details&gt;

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).

Difftastic is a structural diff tool that compares files based on
their syntax.

**For installation instructions, see
[Installation](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/installation.html) in
[the manual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/).**

## Basic Example

![Screenshot of difftastic and JS](img/js.png)

In this JavaScript example, we can see:

(1) Difftastic understands nesting. It highlights the matching `{` and
`}`, but understands that `foo()` hasn&#039;t changed despite the leading
whitespace.

(2) Difftastic understands which lines should be aligned. It&#039;s aligned
`bar(1)` on the left with `bar(2)` on the right, even though the
textual content isn&#039;t identical.

(3) Difftastic understands that line-wrapping isn&#039;t
meaningful. `&quot;eric&quot;` is now on a new line, but it hasn&#039;t changed.

## One Minute Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/480875.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/480875)

This one minute screencast demonstrates difftastic usage with both
standalone files and git.

## Languages

Difftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.

If a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a
textual diff with word highlighting.

## Known Issues

Performance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large
number of changes, and can use a lot of memory.

Display. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can
be confusing.

Robustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.

## Non-goals

Patching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it
does not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you
need a patch.

(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for
difftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same
line, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old
and new file.)

Merging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not
address.

## FAQ

### Isn&#039;t this basically `--word-diff --ignore-all-space`?

Word diffing [can&#039;t do
this](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1510139929971421191/photo/1).

Difftastic parses your code. It understands when whitespace matters,
such as inside string literals or languages like Python. It understands
that `x-1` is three tokens in JS but one token in Lisp.

### Can I use difftastic with git?

You can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git
usage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it
[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).

If you&#039;re an Emacs user, check out [this blog
post](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)
showing one way to use difftastic with magit, as well as
[difftastic.el](https://github.com/pkryger/difftastic.el).

### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?

Probably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your
favourite tool, and I will link it in the README!

### What about parse errors?

By default, difftastic falls back to a line-oriented diff whenever
parse errors are encountered.

This is a conservative choice to ensure that difftastic never claims
two syntactically different files are the same.

Parse errors can occur if the file uses language features that the
parser does not understand, if the language relies on a preprocessor
before parsing (e.g. C++), or if the file has genuine syntactic
mistakes.

In practice, difftastic virtually always produces a good result when
there are a few minor parse errors. Consider allowing a small number
of parse errors when using difftastic.

```
$ export DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT=20
$ difft foo1.c foo2.c
```

### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?

Yes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers
(i.e. `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`).

Pass your file with conflicts as a single argument to
difftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and
diff those.

```
$ difft file_with_conflicts.js
```

### Can difftastic do merges?

No. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.

AST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text
diff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn&#039;t syntactically
significant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.

The [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on
a tree-sitter AST however.

### Can difftastic ignore reordering?

No. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing
e.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.

If you&#039;re diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them
to difftastic.

```
$ difft &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_1.json) &lt;(jq --sort-keys &lt; file_2.json)
```

See also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data
Types](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)
in the manual.

### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?

Yes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without
calculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and
useful for building tools that check for changes.

For example:

```
$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js
```

This will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or
1 if there are changes found.

### Why aren&#039;t colours appearing in my terminal?

Difftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal
themes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that
does this.

If you&#039;re a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to
disable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.

### How does it work?

Difftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses
Dijkstra&#039;s algorithm.

My [blog
post](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)
describes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the
manual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## How to interview using this template

Open ONLY the `shared/` folder within VSCode and in the Extensions Marketplace find `CodeTogether Live`. Install it.

Inside the extension, you&#039;ll have to click on &#039;Host New Session&#039; and then &#039;Start&#039;.

You now have a link in your clipboard, which you should share with the candidate.

Don&#039;t forget to run `npm run vite.dev` inside your editor terminal, since this is not currently possible from the browser editor (link) with the free version of the extension.

The locally running server will display localhost:5173 as well as a the project within the network, which the user can access remotely to see the SPA in action, something like: `10.5.52.144:5173`.

The candidate should be sharing their screen while they read and later approach the challenge!

```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv&#039;s documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they&#039;re not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo &#039;import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))&#039; &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay &#039;hello world!&#039;
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/index/) to get started.

## Acknowledgements

uv&#039;s dependency resolver uses [PubGrub](https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub) under the hood. We&#039;re
grateful to the PubGrub maintainers, especially [Jacob Finkelman](https://github.com/Eh2406), for
their support.

uv&#039;s Git implementation is based on [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

Some of uv&#039;s optimizations are inspired by the great work we&#039;ve seen in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
[Orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), and [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun). We&#039;ve also
learned a lot from Nathaniel J. Smith&#039;s [Posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and adapted its
[trampoline](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/main/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline)
for Windows support.

   &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Loco&lt;/h1&gt;

   &lt;h3&gt;
   &lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;description&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt; --&gt;
🚂 Loco is Rust on Rails.
&lt;!--&lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

## What&#039;s Loco?
`Loco` is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you&#039;ll feel at home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you&#039;ll find Loco refreshing. We do not assume you know Rails.

For a deeper dive into how Loco works, including detailed guides, examples, and API references, check out our [documentation website](https://loco.rs).


## Features of Loco:

* `Convention Over Configuration:` Similar to Ruby on Rails, Loco emphasizes simplicity and productivity by reducing the need for boilerplate code. It uses sensible defaults, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than spending time on configuration.

* `Rapid Development:` Aim for high developer productivity, Loco’s design focuses on reducing boilerplate code and providing intuitive APIs, allowing developers to iterate quickly and build prototypes with minimal effort.

* `ORM Integration:` Model your business with robust entities, eliminating the need to write SQL. Define relationships, validation, and custom logic directly on your entities for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

* `Controllers`: Handle web requests parameters, body, validation, and render a response that is content-aware. We use Axum for the best performance, simplicity, and extensibility. Controllers also allow you to easily build middlewares, which can be used to add logic such as authentication, logging, or error handling before passing requests to the main controller actions.

* `Views:` Loco can integrate with templating engines to generate dynamic HTML content from templates.

* `Background Jobs:` Perform compute or I/O intensive jobs in the background with a Redis backed queue, or with threads. Implementing a worker is as simple as implementing a perform function for the Worker trait.

* `Scheduler:` Simplifies the traditional, often cumbersome crontab system, making it easier and more elegant to schedule tasks or shell scripts.

* `Mailers:` A mailer will deliver emails in the background using the existing loco background worker infrastructure. It will all be seamless for you.

* `Storage:` In Loco Storage, we facilitate working with files through multiple operations. Storage can be in-memory, on disk, or use cloud services such as AWS S3, GCP, and Azure.

* `Cache:` Loco provides an cache layer to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data.

So see more Loco features, check out our [documentation website](https://loco.rs/docs/getting-started/tour/).



## Getting Started
&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;quick-installation-command&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
cargo install loco
cargo install sea-orm-cli # Only when DB is needed
```
&lt;!-- &lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

Now you can create your new app (choose &quot;`SaaS` app&quot;).


&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;loco-cli-new-from-template&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
❯ loco new
✔ ❯ App name? · myapp
✔ ❯ What would you like to build? · Saas App with client side rendering
✔ ❯ Select a DB Provider · Sqlite
✔ ❯ Select your background worker type · Async (in-process tokio async tasks)

🚂 Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp/

- assets: You&#039;ve selected `clientside` for your asset serving configuration.

Next step, build your frontend:
  $ cd frontend/
  $ npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build
```
&lt;!-- &lt;/snip&gt; --&gt;

 Now `cd` into your `myapp` and start your app:
&lt;!-- &lt;snip id=&quot;starting-the-server-command-with-output&quot; inject_from=&quot;yaml&quot; template=&quot;sh&quot;&gt; --&gt;
```sh
$ cargo loco start

```bash
pip install chromadb # python client
# for javascript, npm install chromadb!
# for client-server mode, chroma run --path /chroma_db_path
```

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing) or [Replit template](https://replit.com/@swyx/BasicChromaStarter?v=1)):

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection(&quot;all-my-documents&quot;)

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=[&quot;This is document1&quot;, &quot;This is document2&quot;], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;notion&quot;}, {&quot;source&quot;: &quot;google-docs&quot;}], # filter on these!
    ids=[&quot;doc1&quot;, &quot;doc2&quot;], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=[&quot;This is a query document&quot;],
    n_results=2,
    # where={&quot;metadata_field&quot;: &quot;is_equal_to_this&quot;}, # optional filter
    # where_document={&quot;$contains&quot;:&quot;search_string&quot;}  # optional filter
)
```

## Features

- __Free &amp; Open Source__: Apache 2.0 Licensed

## Use case: ChatGPT for ______

For example, the `&quot;Chat your data&quot;` use case:
1. Add documents to your database. You can pass in your own embeddings, embedding function, or let Chroma embed them for you.
2. Query relevant documents with natural language.
3. Compose documents into the context window of an LLM like `GPT3` for additional summarization or analysis.

## Embeddings?

What are embeddings?

- [Read the guide from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
- __Literal__: Embedding something turns it from image/text/audio into a list of numbers. 🖼️ or 📄 =&gt; `[1.2, 2.1, ....]`. This process makes documents &quot;understandable&quot; to a machine learning model.
- __By analogy__: An embedding represents the essence of a document. This enables documents and queries with the same essence to be &quot;near&quot; each other and therefore easy to find.
- __Technical__: An embedding is the latent-space position of a document at a layer of a deep neural network. For models trained specifically to embed data, this is the last layer.
- __A small example__: If you search your photos for &quot;famous bridge in San Francisco&quot;. By embedding this query and comparing it to the embeddings of your photos and their metadata - it should return photos of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Embeddings databases (also known as **vector databases**) store embeddings and allow you to search by nearest neighbors rather than by substrings like a traditional database. By default, Chroma uses [Sentence Transformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#default:-all-minilm-l6-v2) to embed for you but you can also use OpenAI embeddings, Cohere (multilingual) embeddings, or your own.

## Polars: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust using
[Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) as the memory
model.

- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger-than-RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...

To learn more, read the [user guide](https://docs.pola.rs/).

## Python

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import polars as pl
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         &quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
...         &quot;fruits&quot;: [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;],
...         &quot;B&quot;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
...         &quot;cars&quot;: [&quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;audi&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;],
...     }
... )

# embarrassingly parallel execution &amp; very expressive query language
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.sort(&quot;fruits&quot;).select(
...     &quot;fruits&quot;,
...     &quot;cars&quot;,
...     pl.lit(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;literal_string_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;B&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;cars&quot;) == &quot;beetle&quot;).sum(),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).filter(pl.col(&quot;B&quot;) &gt; 2).sum().over(&quot;cars&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_cars&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sum().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sum_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).reverse().over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;rev_A_by_fruits&quot;),
...     pl.col(&quot;A&quot;).sort_by(&quot;B&quot;).over(&quot;fruits&quot;).alias(&quot;sort_A_by_B_by_fruits&quot;),

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance 🚀🚀

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay&#039;s new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure.

Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:

* [Hyperswitch Backend](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch): Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.

* [SDK (Frontend)](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web): The SDK, available for web, [Android, and iOS](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-client-core), unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user&#039;s saved payment methods.    

* [Control Center](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-control-center): The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.

&lt;/a&gt;

### 1. Local Setup

#### One-Click Setup (Recommended)

You can run Hyperswitch on your system with a single command using our one-click setup script:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch
cd hyperswitch
scripts/setup.sh
```

The above script will:
- Check for prerequisites (Docker Compose/Podman)
- Set up necessary configurations
- Let you select a deployment profile:
  - **Standard**: Recommended - App server + Control Center + Web SDK.
  - **Full**: Standard + Monitoring + Scheduler.
  - **Standalone App Server**: Core services only (Hyperswitch server, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Start the selected services
- Check service health
- Provide access information

The next step is to [configure a connector][configure-a-connector] with the Hyperswitch Control Center and [try a payment][try-a-payment].

Check out the [local setup guide][local-setup-guide] for more details on setting up the entire stack or component wise.


### 2. Deployment on cloud
