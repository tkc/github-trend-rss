## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust&#039;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on
correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

- **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and releases

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
&gt; the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
&gt; We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

Install optional dependencies as &#039;extras&#039; for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):

```bash
pip install -U &quot;nautilus_trader[docker,ib]&quot;
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |

**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.
Skipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, in

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world&#039;s code and human engineers now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Easily switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Quickly review work and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server

You can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).

## Installation

Make sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

## Documentation

Please head to the [website](https://vibekanban.com/docs) for the latest documentation and user guides.

## Support

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) for feature requests. Please open a discussion to create a feature request. For bugs please open an issue on this repo.

## Contributing

We would prefer that ideas and changes are first raised with the core team via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/AC4nwVtJM3), where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (&gt;=18)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (&gt;=8)

Additional development tools:
```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the dev server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the backend. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.

### Building the frontend

To build just the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

### Build from source (macOS)

1. Run `./local-build.sh`
2. Test with `cd npx-cli &amp;&amp; node bin/cli.js`


### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |
| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |
| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |
| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |
| `MCP_HOST` | Runtime | Value of `HOST` | MCP server connection host (use `127.0.0.1` when `HOST=0.0.0.0` on Windows) |
| `MCP_PORT` | Runtime | Value of `BACKEND_PORT` | MCP server connection port |
| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable git worktree cleanup (for debugging) |
| `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Runtime | Not set | Comma-separated list of origins that are allowed to make backend API requests (e.g., `https://my-vibekanban-frontend.com`) |

**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.

#### Self-Hosting with a Reverse Proxy or Custom Domain

When running Vibe Kanban behind a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy, Traefik) or on a custom domain, you must set the `VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. Without this, the browser&#039;s Origin header won&#039;t match the backend&#039;s expected host, and API requests will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

Set it to the full origin URL(s) where your frontend is accessible:

```bash
# Single origin
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com

# Multiple origins (comma-separated)
VK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://vk.example.com,https://vk-staging.example.com
```

### Remote Deployment

When running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:

1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI
2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:
   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP
   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server
   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)
   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension

When configured, the &quot;Open in VSCode&quot; buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.

See the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.

A hat-based orchestration framework that keeps Ralph in a loop until the task is done.

&gt; &quot;Me fail English? That&#039;s unpossible!&quot; - Ralph Wiggum

**Notice:** Ralph Orchestrator is under active development. It works today, but expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases.

v1.0.0 was ralphed into existence with little oversight and guidance. v2.0.0 is a simpler, more-structured implementation. Looking for the old version? See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3).

## What is Ralph?

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) — autonomous task completion through continuous iteration.

&gt; &quot;The orchestrator is a thin coordination layer, not a platform. Ralph is smart; let Ralph do the work.&quot;

### Two Modes of Operation

Ralph supports two orchestration styles:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Traditional** | Simple loop — Ralph iterates until done | Quick tasks, simple automation, minimal config |
| **Hat-Based** | Ralph can wear many hats — specialized personas coordinate through events | Complex workflows, multi-step processes, role separation |

**Traditional mode** is the original Ralph Wiggum approach: start a loop, let it run until it outputs the completion promise. No roles, no events, just iteration.

**Hat-based mode** adds structure: specialized personas coordinate through events. You define the roles that fit your workflow — reviewers, testers, documenters, whatever makes sense. Presets provide ready-made patterns like TDD or spec-driven development.

### The Ralph Tenets

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability** — Each iteration clears context. Re-read specs, plan, code every cycle.
2. **Backpressure Over Prescription** — Don&#039;t prescribe how; create gates that reject bad work.
3. **The Plan Is Disposable** — Regeneration costs one planning loop. Cheap.
4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory** — Files are the handoff mechanism.
5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts** — Add signs, not scripts.
6. **Let Ralph Ralph** — Sit *on* the loop, not *in* it.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full philosophy.

## Features

- **Multi-Backend Support** — Works with Claude Code, Kiro, Gemini CLI, Codex, Amp, Copilot CLI, and OpenCode
- **Hat System** — Specialized Ralph personas with distinct behaviors
- **Event-Driven Coordination** — Hats communicate through typed events with glob pattern matching
- **Backpressure Enforcement** — Gates that reject incomplete work (tests, lint, typecheck)
- **Presets Library** — 20+ pre-configured workflows for common development patterns
- **Interactive TUI** — Real-time terminal UI for monitoring Ralph&#039;s activity (experimental)
- **Session Recording** — Record and replay sessions for debugging and testing (experimental)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+
- At least one AI CLI:
  - [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (recommended)
  - [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
  - [Amp](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp)
  - [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot) (`npm install -g @github/copilot`)
  - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`)

### Via npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx @ralph-orchestrator/ralph-cli --version
```

### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install ralph-orchestrator
```

### Via Cargo

```bash
cargo install ralph-cli
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator.git
cd ralph-orchestrator
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release&quot;

# Or create symlink
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/ralph /usr/local/bin/ralph
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
ralph --version
ralph --help
```

### Migrating from v1 (Python)

If you have the old Python-based Ralph v1 installed, uninstall it first to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# If installed via pip
pip uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via pipx
pipx uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# If installed via uv
uv tool uninstall ralph-orchestrator

# Verify removal
which ralph  # Should return nothing or point to new Rust version
```

The v1 Python version is no longer maintained. See [v1.2.3](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator/tree/v1.2.3) for historical reference.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Traditional mode — simple loop, no hats (recommended for getting started)
ralph init --backend claude

# Hat-based mode — use a preset workflow with specialized personas
ralph init --preset tdd-red-green

# Combine preset with different backend
ralph init --preset spec-driven --backend kiro

# See all available presets
ralph init --list-presets
```

This creates `ralph.yml` in your current directory. Without a preset, you get traditional mode (no hats). With a preset, you get hat-based orchestration.

### 2. Define Your Task

**Option A:** Create a `PROMPT.md` file:

```bash
cat &gt; PROMPT.md &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
Build a REST API with the following endpoints:
- POST /users - Create a new user
- GET /users/:id - Get user by ID
- PUT /users/:id - Update user
- DELETE /users/:id - Delete user

Use Express.js with TypeScript. Include input validation
and proper error handling.
EOF
```

**Option B:** Pass inline prompt when running:

```bash
ralph run -p &quot;Add input validation to the user API endpoints&quot;
```

### 3. Run Ralph

```bash
# Autonomous mode (headless, default)
ralph run

# With inline prompt
ralph run -p &quot;Implement the login endpoint with JWT authentication&quot;

# TUI mode (experimental)
ralph run --tui

# Resume interrupted session
ralph resume

# Dry run (show what would execute)
ralph run --dry-run
```

### Alternative: SOP-Driven Sessions

For standalone planning and task generation (without Ralph&#039;s event loop), use these commands:

```bash
# Start an interactive PDD planning session
ralph plan                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph plan &quot;build a REST API&quot;        # Provide idea inline
ralph plan --backend kiro &quot;my idea&quot;  # Use specific backend

# Generate code task files from descriptions
ralph task                           # SOP prompts for input
ralph task &quot;add authentication&quot;      # From description
ralph task specs/feature/plan.md     # From PDD plan file
```

These commands spawn an interactive AI session with bundled SOPs — perfect for one-off planning without configuring a full workflow.

## Configuration

Ralph uses a YAML configuration file (`ralph.yml` by default).

### Traditional Mode (No Hats)

The simplest configuration — just a loop that runs until completion:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Traditional mode
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;

event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;
  max_iterations: 100
```

This runs Ralph in a loop. No hats, no events, no role switching. Ralph iterates until it outputs `LOOP_COMPLETE` or hits the iteration limit.

### Hat-Based Mode (Specialized Personas)

&gt; Ralph can wear many hats.

Add a `hats` section to enable role-based orchestration. Hats subscribe to events (triggers) and publish events when done:

```yaml
# ralph.yml — Hat-based mode (example structure)
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;

event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;
  max_iterations: 100
  starting_event: &quot;task.start&quot;

hats:
  my_hat:
    name: &quot;🎯 My Hat&quot;
    triggers: [&quot;task.start&quot;]        # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: [&quot;work.done&quot;]        # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |
      Your instructions here...
```

With hats, Ralph publishes a starting event, which triggers the matching hat. That hat does its work and publishes an event, potentially triggering other hats. This event-driven handoff continues until completion.

&gt; **Tip:** Use `ralph init --preset &lt;name&gt;` to get pre-configured hat workflows. See [Presets](#presets) for ready-made patterns like TDD, spec-driven development, and more.

### Full Configuration Reference

```yaml
# Event loop settings
event_loop:
  completion_promise: &quot;LOOP_COMPLETE&quot;  # Output that signals completion
  max_iterations: 100                   # Maximum orchestration loops
  max_runtime_seconds: 14400            # 4 hours max runtime
  idle_timeout_secs: 1800               # 30 min idle timeout
  starting_event: &quot;task.start&quot;          # First event published

# CLI backend settings
cli:
  backend: &quot;claude&quot;                     # claude, kiro, gemini, codex, amp, copilot, opencode, custom
  prompt_mode: &quot;arg&quot;                    # arg (CLI argument) or stdin

# Core behaviors (always injected into prompts)
core:
  scratchpad: &quot;.agent/scratchpad.md&quot;    # Shared memory across iterations
  specs_dir: &quot;./specs/&quot;                 # Directory for specifications
  guardrails:                           # Rules injected into every prompt
    - &quot;Fresh context each iteration - scratchpad is memory&quot;
    - &quot;Don&#039;t assume &#039;not implemented&#039; - search first&quot;
    - &quot;Backpressure is law - tests/typecheck/lint must pass&quot;

# Custom hats (omit to use default planner/builder)
hats:
  my_hat:
    name: &quot;My Hat Name&quot;                 # Display name
    triggers: [&quot;some.event&quot;]            # Events that activate this hat
    publishes: [&quot;other.event&quot;]          # Events this hat can emit
    instructions: |                     # Prompt instructions
      What this hat should do...
```

## Key Concepts

### Hats

Hats are specialized Ralph personas. Each hat has:

- **Triggers**: Events that activate this hat
- **Publishes**: Events this hat can emit
- **Instructions**: Prompt injected when hat is active

View event history:

```bash
ralph events
```

### Scratchpad

All hats share `.agent/scratchpad.md` — persistent memory across iterations. This enables hats to build on previous work rather than starting fresh.

The scratchpad is the primary mechanism for:
- Task tracking (with `[ ]`, `[x]`, `[~]` markers)
- Context preservation between iterations
- Handoff between hats

### Backpressure

Ralph enforces quality gates through backpressure. When a builder publishes `build.done`, it must include evidence:

```
tests: pass, lint: pass, typecheck: pass
```

| `ralph-bench` | Benchmarking harness (dev-only) |

## Building &amp; Testing

### Build

```bash
cargo build           # Debug build
cargo build --release # Release build
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests (includes smoke tests with JSONL replay)
cargo test

# Run smoke tests specifically
cargo test -p ralph-core smoke_runner

# Run Kiro-specific smoke tests
cargo test -p ralph-core kiro
```

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests use recorded JSONL fixtures instead of live API calls — fast, free, and deterministic.

**Fixture locations:**
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/basic_session.jsonl` — Claude CLI session
- `crates/ralph-core/tests/fixtures/kiro/` — Kiro CLI sessions

**Recording new fixtures:**

```bash
# Record a session
ralph run -c ralph.yml --record-session session.jsonl -p &quot;your prompt&quot;

# Or capture raw CLI output
claude -p &quot;your prompt&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee output.txt
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo fmt --check
```

&gt; **January 2026**: Worktrunk was [released](https://x.com/max_sixty/status/2006077845391724739?s=20) over the holidays, and lots of folks seem to be using it. It&#039;s built with love (there&#039;s no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), &amp; [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg). Please let me know any frictions at all; I&#039;m intensely focused on making Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest gap is understanding how others experience using it.

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.

Worktrunk&#039;s three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.

Scaling agents becomes trivial. A quick demo:

![Worktrunk Demo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/max-sixty/worktrunk-assets@main/assets/docs/light/wt-core.gif)

&gt; ### 📚 Full documentation at [worktrunk.dev](https://worktrunk.dev) 📚

&lt;!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from docs/content/worktrunk.md#context-git-worktrees..worktrunk-makes-git-worktrees-as-easy-as-branches — edit source to update --&gt;

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it&#039;s possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git&#039;s native
worktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don&#039;t step
on each other&#039;s changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template.

&gt; Start with the core commands

**Core commands:**

&lt;table class=&quot;cmd-compare&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Worktrunk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Plain git&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Switch worktrees&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo.feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create + start Claude&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt switch -c -x claude feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
cd ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
claude&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Clean up&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt remove&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cd ../repo &amp;&amp; \
git worktree remove ../repo.feat &amp;&amp; \
git branch -d feat&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;List with status&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;wt list&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git worktree list&lt;/pre&gt; (paths only)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

**Workflow automation:**

&gt; Expand into the more advanced commands as needed

- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**

A demo with some advanced features:

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS &amp; Linux):**

```bash
brew install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**

```bash
cargo install worktrunk &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

On Windows, `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal&#039;s command. Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:

```bash
winget install max-sixty.worktrunk
git-wt config shell install
```

Alternatively, disable Windows Terminal&#039;s alias (Settings → Privacy &amp; security → For developers → App Execution Aliases → disable &quot;Windows Terminal&quot;) to use `wt` directly.

&lt;/details&gt;

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
paru worktrunk-bin &amp;&amp; wt config shell install
```

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What Can I Do with Hyperswitch?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a modular, open-source payments infrastructure designed for flexibility and control. Apart from our Payment Suite offering, this solution allows businesses to pick and integrate only the modules they need on top of their existing payment stack — without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.

Each module is independent and purpose-built to optimize different aspects of payment processing.

  If you need further help, check out our [video tutorial](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/overview/unified-local-setup-using-docker).  

  👉 After setup, [configure a connector](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/using-hyperswitch-control-center#add-a-payment-processor) and [test a payment](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/test-a-payment).
&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Hosted Sandbox (No Setup Required)&lt;/h3&gt;

Hyperswitch offers a fully hosted sandbox environment that requires no setup. You can explore the Control Center, configure payment connectors, and test payments directly from the UI.

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.hyperswitch.io&quot;&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/imgs/try-the-sandbox.png?raw=true&quot; height=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What you can do in the Hosted Sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  - Access the full Control Center  
  - Configure payment connectors  
  - View logs, routing rules, and retry strategies  
  - Try payments directly from the UI  
&lt;/details&gt;

## Why Hyperswitch?

Hyperswitch is a commercial open-source payments stack purpose-built for scale, flexibility, and developer experience. Designed with a modular architecture, Hyperswitch lets you pick only the components you need—whether it’s routing, retries, vaulting, or observability—without vendor lock-in or bloated integrations.

Built in Rust for performance and reliability, Hyperswitch supports global payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, UPI, Pay by Bank), exposes smart routing and retry logic, and provides a visual workflow builder in the Control Center. Whether you&#039;re integrating a full payment suite or augmenting an existing stack with a single module, Hyperswitch meets you where you are.

&lt;strong&gt;“Linux for Payments”&lt;/strong&gt; — Hyperswitch is a well-architected reference for teams who want to own their payments stack.

We believe in:

- &lt;strong&gt; Embracing Payment Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; Innovation comes from enabling choice—across payment methods, processors, and flows.

- &lt;strong&gt; Open Source by Default:&lt;/strong&gt; Transparency drives trust and builds better, reusable software.

- &lt;strong&gt; Community-Driven Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Our roadmap is shaped by real-world use cases and contributors. 

- &lt;strong&gt; Systems-Level Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; We hold ourselves to a high bar for reliability, security, and performance.

- &lt;strong&gt; Maximizing Value Creation:&lt;/strong&gt; For developers, customers, and partners alike.

- &lt;strong&gt; Community-Driven, Enterprise-Tested:&lt;/strong&gt; Hyperswitch is built in the open with real-world feedback from developers and contributors, and maintained by Juspay, the team powering payment infrastructure for 400+ leading enterprises worldwide.

`gitoxide` is an implementation of `git` written in Rust for developing future-proof applications which strive for correctness and
performance while providing a pleasant and unsurprising developer experience.

There are two primary ways to use `gitoxide`:

1. **As Rust library**: Use the [`gix`](https://docs.rs/gix) crate as a Cargo dependency for API access.
1. **As command-line tool**: The `gix` binary as development tool to help testing the API in real repositories,
    and the `ein` binary with workflow-enhancing tools. Both binaries may forever be unstable,
    *do not rely on them in scripts*.

## Development Status

The command-line tools as well as the status of each crate is described in
[the crate status document](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md).

For use in applications, look for the [`gix`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix) crate,
which serves as entrypoint to the functionality provided by various lower-level plumbing crates like
[`gix-config`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix-config).

### Feature Discovery

&gt; Can `gix` do what I need it to do?

The above can be hard to answer and this paragraph is here to help with feature discovery.

Look at [`crate-status.md`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md) for a rather exhaustive document that contains
both implemented and planned features.

Further, the [`gix` crate documentation with the `git2` search term](https://docs.rs/gix/latest/gix?search=git2) helps to find all currently
known `git2` equivalent method calls. Please note that this list is definitely not exhaustive yet, but might help if you are coming from `git2`.

What follows is a high-level list of features and those which are planned:

* [x] clone
* [x] fetch
* [ ] push
* [x] blame (*plumbing*)
* [x] status
* [x] blob and tree-diff
* [ ] merge
    - [x] blobs
    - [x] trees
    - [ ] commits
* [x] commit
    - [ ] hooks
* [x] commit-graph traversal
* [ ] rebase
* [x] worktree checkout and worktree stream
* [ ] reset
* [x] reading and writing of objects
* [x] reading and writing of refs
* [x] reading and writing of `.git/index`
* [x] reading and writing of git configuration
* [x] pathspecs
* [x] revspecs
* [x] `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

### Crates

Follow linked crate name for detailed status. Please note that all crates follow [semver] as well as the [stability guide].

[semver]: https://semver.org

### Production Grade

* **Stability Tier 1**
  - [gix-lock](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-lock/README.md)

* **Stability Tier 2**
  - [gix-tempfile](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-tempfile/README.md)

### Stabilization Candidates

Crates that seem feature complete and need to see some more use before they can be released as 1.0.

### Stability and MSRV

Our [stability guide] helps to judge how much churn can be expected when depending on crates in this workspace.

[stability guide]: https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/STABILITY.md

## Installation

### Download a Binary Release

Using `cargo binstall`, one is able to fetch [binary releases][releases]. You can install it via `cargo install cargo-binstall`, assuming
the [rust toolchain][rustup] is present.

Then install gitoxide with `cargo binstall gitoxide`.

See the [releases section][releases] for manual installation and various alternative builds that are _slimmer_ or _smaller_, depending
on your needs, for _Linux_, _MacOS_ and _Windows_.

[releases]: https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/releases

### Download from Arch Linux repository

For Arch Linux you can download `gitoxide` from `community` repository:

```sh
pacman -S gitoxide
```

### Download from Exherbo Linux Rust repository

For Exherbo Linux you can download `gitoxide` from the [Rust](https://gitlab.exherbo.org/exherbo/rust/-/tree/master/packages/dev-scm/gitoxide) repository:

```sh
cave resolve -x repository/rust
cave resolve -x gitoxide
```

### From Source via Cargo

`cargo` is the Rust package manager which can easily be obtained through [rustup]. With it, you can build your own binary
effortlessly and for your particular CPU for additional performance gains.

The minimum supported Rust version is [documented in the Cargo package](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix/Cargo.toml#L12-L14),
the latest stable one will work as well.

There are various build configurations, all of them are [documented here](https://docs.rs/crate/gitoxide/latest). The documentation should also be useful
for packagers who need to tune external dependencies.

```sh
# A way to install `gitoxide` with just Rust and a C compiler installed.
# If there are problems with SSL certificates during clones, try to omit `--locked`.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features max-pure

# The default installation, &#039;max&#039;, is the fastest, but also needs `cmake` to build successfully.
# Installing it is platform-dependent.
cargo install gitoxide

# For smaller binaries and even faster build times that are traded for a less fancy CLI implementation,
# use the `lean` feature.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features lean
```

The following installs the latest unpublished `max` release directly from git:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

#### How to deal with build failures

On some platforms, installation may fail due to lack of tools required by *C* toolchains. This can generally be avoided by installation with:

```sh
cargo install gitoxide --no-default-features --features max-pure
```

What follows is a list of known failures.

- On Fedora, `perl` needs to be installed for `OpenSSL` to build properly. This can be done with the following command (see [issue #592](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/592)):

  ```sh
  dnf install perl
  ```

### Using Docker

Some CI/CD pipelines leverage repository cloning. Below is a copy-paste-able example to build docker images for such workflows.
As no official image exists (at this time), an image must first be built.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The dockerfile isn&#039;t continuously tested as it costs too much time and thus might already be broken.
&gt; PRs are welcome.

#### Building the most compatible base image

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress . --target=pipeline
```

#### Basic usage in a Pipeline

For example, if a `Dockerfile` currently uses something like `RUN git clone https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide`, first build the image:

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress .
```

Then copy the binaries into your image and replace the `git` directive with a `gix` equivalent.

```dockerfile
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/gix /usr/local/bin/
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/ein /usr/local/bin/

RUN /usr/local/bin/gix clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs

## Usage

Once installed, there are two binaries:

* **ein**
  * high level commands, _porcelain_, for every-day use, optimized for a pleasant user experience
* **gix**
  * low level commands, _plumbing_, for use in more specialized cases and to validate newly written code in real-world scenarios

## Project Goals

Project goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **a pure-rust implementation of git**
   * including *transport*, *object database*, *references*, *cli* and *tui*
   * a simple command-line interface is provided for the most common git operations, optimized for
     user experience. A *simple-git* if you so will.
   * be the go-to implementation for anyone who wants to solve problems around git, and become
     *the* alternative to `GitPython` and *libgit2* in the process.
   * become the foundation for a distributed alternative to GitHub, and maybe even for use within GitHub itself
 * **learn from the best to write the best possible idiomatic Rust**
   * *libgit2* is a fantastic resource to see what abstractions work, we will use them
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to make misuse impossible
 * **be the best performing implementation**
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to optimize for work not done without being hard to use
   * make use of parallelism from the get go
   * _sparse checkout_ support from day one
 * **assure on-disk consistency**
   * assure reads never interfere with concurrent writes
   * assure multiple concurrent writes don&#039;t cause trouble
 * **take shortcuts, but not in quality**
   * binaries may use `anyhow::Error` exhaustively, knowing these errors are solely user-facing.
   * libraries use light-weight custom errors implemented using `quick-error` or `thiserror`.
   * internationalization is nothing we are concerned with right now.
   * IO errors due to insufficient amount of open file handles don&#039;t always lead to operation failure
 * **Cross platform support, including Windows**
   * With the tools and experience available here there is no reason not to support Windows.
   * [Windows is tested on CI](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/df66d74aa2a8cb62d8a03383135f08c8e8c579a8/.github/workflows/rust.yml#L34)
     and failures do prevent releases.

## Non-Goals

Project non-goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **replicate `git` command functionality perfectly**
   * `git` is `git`, and there is no reason to not use it. Our path is the one of simplicity to make
     getting started with git easy.
 * **be incompatible to git**
   * the on-disk format must remain compatible, and we will never contend with it.
 * **use async IO everywhere**
   * for the most part, git operations are heavily reliant on memory mapped IO as well as CPU to decompress data,
     which doesn&#039;t lend itself well to async IO out of the box.
   * Use `blocking` as well as `gix-features::interrupt` to bring operations into the async world and to control
     long running operations.
   * When connecting or streaming over TCP connections, especially when receiving on the server, async seems like a must
     though, but behind a feature flag.

## Contributions

## Roadmap

### Features for 1.0

Provide a CLI to for the most basic user journey:

* [x] initialize a repository
* [x] fetch
    * [ ] and update worktree
* clone a repository
   - [ ] bare
   - [ ] with working tree
* [ ] create a commit after adding worktree files
* [x] add a remote
* [ ] push
  * [x] create (thin) pack

### Ideas for Examples

* [ ] `gix tool open-remote` open the URL of the remote, possibly after applying known transformations to go from `ssh` to `https`.
* [ ] `tix` as example implementation of `tig`, displaying a version of the commit graph, useful for practicing how highly responsive GUIs can be made.
* [ ] Something like [`git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer), but leveraging extreme decompression speeds of indexed packs.
* [ ] Open up SQL for git using [sqlite virtual tables](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/blob/master/tests/vtab.rs). Check out gitqlite

# `cross`

&gt; “Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates

This project is developed and maintained by the [cross-rs] team.
It was previously maintained by the Rust Embedded Working Group Tools team.
New contributors are welcome! Please join our [Matrix room] and say hi.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;`cross test`ing a crate for the aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu target&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Features

- `cross` will provide all the ingredients needed for cross compilation without
  touching your system installation.

- `cross` provides an environment, cross toolchain and cross compiled libraries,
  that produces the most portable binaries.

- “cross testing”, `cross` can test crates for architectures other than i686 and
  x86_64.

- The stable, beta and nightly channels are supported.

## Dependencies

See our [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide for detailed
installation instructions.

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- A Linux kernel with [binfmt_misc] support is required for cross testing.

One of these container engines is required. If both are installed, `cross` will
default to `docker`.

- [Docker]. Note that on Linux non-sudo users need to be in the `docker` group or use rootless docker.
  Read the container engine [install guide][docker_install] for the required installation and post-installation steps. Requires version 20.10 (API 1.40) or later.
- [Podman]. Requires version 3.4.0 or later.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
```

It&#039;s also possible to directly download the pre-compiled [release
binaries](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/releases) or use
[cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).

## Usage

`cross` has the exact same CLI as [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
but relies on Docker or Podman. For Docker, you&#039;ll have to start
the daemon before you can use it.

```
# (ONCE PER BOOT, on Linux)
# Start the Docker daemon, if it&#039;s not already running using systemd
# on WSL2 and other systems using SysVinit, use `sudo service docker start`.
$ sudo systemctl start docker

# MAGIC! This Just Works
$ cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# EVEN MORE MAGICAL! This also Just Works
$ cross test --target mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64

# Obviously, this also Just Works
$ cross rustc --target powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu --release -- -C lto
```

Additional documentation can be found on the
[wiki](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/wiki) or the `docs/` subfolder.

## Configuration

### Configuring cross behavior

You have four options to configure `cross`. All of these options use the TOML
format for configuration and the possible configuration values are documented
[here][config_file].

#### Option 1: Configuring `cross` directly in your `Cargo.toml`

You can directly set [configuration values][config_file] in your `Cargo.toml`
file, under the `[workspace.metadata.cross]` table, i.e. key prefix. An example
config snippet would look like this:

```toml,cargo
[workspace.metadata.cross.target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]

#### Option 2: Configuring `cross` via a `Cross.toml` file

You can put your [configuration][config_file] inside a `Cross.toml` file
in your project root directory.

#### Option 3: Using `CROSS_CONFIG` to specify the location of your configuration

By setting the `CROSS_CONFIG` environment variable, you can tell `cross` where
it should search for the config file. This way you are not limited to a
`Cross.toml` file in the project root.

#### Option 4: Configuring `cross` through environment variables

Besides the TOML-based configuration files, config can be passed through
[environment variables][docs_env_vars], too.


### Docker in Docker

When running `cross` from inside a container, `cross` needs access to
the hosts docker daemon itself. This is normally achieved by mounting the
docker daemons socket `/var/run/docker.sock`. For example:

```
$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v .:/project \
  -w /project my/development-image:tag cross build --target mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64
```

The image running `cross` requires the rust development tools to be installed.

With this setup `cross` must find and mount the correct host paths into the
container used for cross compilation. This includes the original project
directory as well as the root path of the parent container to give access to
the rust build tools.

To inform `cross` that it is running inside a container set
`CROSS_CONTAINER_IN_CONTAINER=true`.

A development or CI container can be created like this:

```
FROM rust:1

# set CROSS_CONTAINER_IN_CONTAINER to inform `cross` that it is executed from within a container
ENV CROSS_CONTAINER_IN_CONTAINER=true

# install `cross`
RUN cargo install cross

...

```

**Limitations**: Finding the mount point for the containers root directory is
currently only available for the overlayfs2 storage driver. In order to access
the parent containers rust setup, the child container mounts the parents
overlayfs. The parent must not be stopped before the child container, as the
overlayfs can not be unmounted correctly by Docker if the child container still
accesses it.


### Explicitly choose the container engine

By default, `cross` tries to use [Docker] or [Podman], in that order.
If you want to choose a container engine explicitly, you can set the
binary name (or path) using the `CROSS_CONTAINER_ENGINE`
environment variable.

For example in case you want use [Podman], you can set `CROSS_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`.


## Supported targets

A target is considered as “supported” if `cross` can cross compile a
“non-trivial” (binary) crate, usually Cargo, for that target.

Testing support (`cross test`) is more complicated. It relies on [QEMU]
emulation, so testing may fail due to QEMU bugs rather than bugs in your crate.
That said, a target has a ✓ in `test` column of the table below if it can run
the [`compiler-builtins`] test suite.

[QEMU]: https://www.qemu.org/
[`compiler-builtins`]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/compiler-builtins

Also, testing is very slow. `cross test` runs units tests *sequentially* because
QEMU gets upset when you spawn multiple threads. This means that, if one of your
unit tests spawns threads, then it&#039;s more likely to fail or, worst, never
terminate.

Additional Dockerfiles for other targets can be found in
[cross-toolchains](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross-toolchains). These include
MSVC and Apple Darwin targets, which we cannot ship pre-built images of.


## Debugging

### QEMU_STRACE (v0.1.9+)

You can set the QEMU_STRACE variable when you use `cross run` to get a backtrace
of system calls from “foreign” (non x86_64) binaries.

```
$ cargo new --bin hello &amp;&amp; cd $_

$ QEMU_STRACE=1 cross run --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
9 brk(NULL) = 0x0000004000023000
9 uname(0x4000823128) = 0
(..)
9 write(1,0xa06320,14)Hello, world!
 = 14
9 sigaltstack(0x4000823588,(nil)) = 0
9 munmap(0x0000004000b16000,16384) = 0
9 exit_group(0)
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.92.0 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

Some cross-compilation targets require a later Rust version, and using Xargo
requires a nightly Rust toolchain.

&gt; Life is short, skim!

We spend so much of our time navigating through files, lines, and commands. That&#039;s where Skim comes in!
It&#039;s a powerful fuzzy finder designed to make your workflow faster and more efficient.

[![skim demo](https://asciinema.org/a/pIfwazaM0mTHA8F7qRbjrqOnm.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/pIfwazaM0mTHA8F7qRbjrqOnm)

Skim provides a single executable called `sk`. Think of it as a smarter alternative to tools like
`grep` - once you try it, you&#039;ll wonder how you ever lived without it!

# Installation

The skim project contains several components:

1. `sk` executable - the core program
2. Vim/Nvim plugin - to call `sk` inside Vim/Nvim. Check [skim.vim](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/blob/master/plugin/skim.vim) for Vim support.

&lt;/a&gt;

## Manually

Any of the following applies:

- Using the install script:
    ```sh
    # Always check the content of the script before running it !
    $ curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/releases/latest/download/skim-installer.sh | sh
    ```
- Using Binary: Simply [download the sk executable](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/releases) directly.
- Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/): Run `cargo +nightly install skim` (or `cargo install skim --no-default-features --features cli` if you don&#039;t like using nightly rust, which will make you lose the `frizbee` typo-resistant matcher)
- Build Manually:
    ```sh
    $ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:skim-rs/skim.git ~/.skim
    $ cd ~/.skim
    $ cargo +nightly install
    $ cargo +nightly build --release
    $ # Add the resulting `target/release/sk` executable to your PATH
    ```

# Usage

Skim can be used either as a general filter (similar to `grep`) or as an interactive
interface for running commands.

## As Vim plugin

Via vim-plug (recommended):

Install skim, then :

```vim
Plug &#039;skim-rs/skim&#039;
```


## As filter

Here are some examples to get you started:

```bash
# directly invoke skim
sk

# Or pipe some input to it (press TAB key to select multiple items when -m is enabled)
vim $(find . -name &quot;*.rs&quot; | sk -m)
```
This last command lets you select files with the &quot;.rs&quot; extension and opens
your selections in Vim - a great time-saver for developers!

## As Interactive Interface

`skim` can invoke other commands dynamically. Normally you would want to
integrate it with [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/),
[ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack2),
[ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), or
[rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching contents in a
project directory:

```sh
# works with grep
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;grep -rI --color=always --line-number &quot;{}&quot; .&#039;
# works with ack
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;ack --color &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
# works with ag
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;ag --color &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
# works with rg
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;rg --color=always --line-number &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
```

&gt; **Note**: In these examples, `{}` will be literally expanded to the current input query.
&gt; This means these examples will search for the exact query string, not fuzzily.
&gt; For fuzzy searching, pipe the command output into `sk` without using interactive mode.

![interactive mode demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1527040/21603930/655d859a-d1db-11e6-9fec-c25099d30a12.gif)

## Shell Bindings

Bindings for Fish, Bash and Zsh are available in the `shell` directory:
- `completion.{shell}` contains the completion scripts for `sk` cli usage
- `key-bindings.{shell}` contains key-binds and shell integrations:
    - `ctrl-t` to select a file through `sk`
    - `ctrl-r` to select an history entry through `sk`
    - `alt-c`  to `cd` into a directory selected through `sk`
    - (not available in `fish`) `**` to complete file paths, for example `ls **&lt;tab&gt;` will show a `sk` widget to select a folder

To enable these features, source the `key-bindings.{shell}` file and set up completions according to your shell&#039;s documentation or see below.

### Shell Completions

You can generate shell completions for your preferred shell using the `--shell` flag with one of the supported shells: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, or `elvish`:

&gt; **Note:** While PowerShell completions are supported, Windows is not supported for now.

#### Option 1: Source directly in your current shell session

```sh
# For bash
source &lt;(sk --shell bash)

# For zsh
source &lt;(sk --shell zsh)

# For fish
sk --shell fish | source
```

#### Option 2: Save to a file to be loaded automatically on shell startup

```sh
# For bash, add to ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;source &lt;(sk --shell bash)&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc  # Or save to ~/.bash_completion

# For zsh, add to ~/.zshrc
sk --shell zsh &gt; ~/.zfunc/_sk  # Create ~/.zfunc directory and add to fpath in ~/.zshrc

# For fish, add to ~/.config/fish/completions/
sk --shell fish &gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/sk.fish
```

## Key Bindings

Some commonly used key bindings:

| Key               | Action                                     |
|------------------:|--------------------------------------------|
| Enter             | Accept (select current one and quit)       |
| ESC/Ctrl-G        | Abort                                      |
| Ctrl-P/Up         | Move cursor up                             |
| Ctrl-N/Down       | Move cursor Down                           |
| TAB               | Toggle selection and move down (with `-m`) |
| Shift-TAB         | Toggle selection and move up (with `-m`)   |

For a complete list of key bindings, refer to the [man
page](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/blob/master/man/man1/sk.1) (`man sk`).

## Search Syntax

`skim` borrows `fzf`&#039;s syntax for matching items:

| Token    | Match type                 | Description                       |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `text`   | fuzzy-match                | items that match `text`           |
| `^music` | prefix-exact-match         | items that start with `music`     |
| `.mp3$`  | suffix-exact-match         | items that end with `.mp3`        |
| `&#039;wild`  | exact-match (quoted)       | items that include `wild`         |
| `!fire`  | inverse-exact-match        | items that do not include `fire`  |
| `!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | items that do not end with `.mp3` |

`skim` also supports the combination of tokens.

- Whitespace has the meaning of `AND`. With the term `src main`, `skim` will search
    for items that match **both** `src` and `main`.
- ` | ` means `OR` (note the spaces around `|`). With the term `.md$ |
    .markdown$`, `skim` will search for items ends with either `.md` or
    `.markdown`.
- `OR` has higher precedence. For example, `readme .md$ | .markdown$` is interpreted as
    `readme AND (.md$ OR .markdown$)`.

- When using the `--split-match` option, each part around spaces or `|` will be matched in a split way:
    - If the option&#039;s value (defaulting to `:`) is absent from the query, do a normal match
    - If it is present, match everything before to everything before it in the items, and everything after it (including potential other occurences of the delimiter) to the part after it in the items. This is particularly useful when piping in input from `rg` to match on both file name and content.

If you prefer using regular expressions, `skim` offers a `regex` mode:

```sh
sk --regex
```

You can switch to `regex` mode dynamically by pressing `Ctrl-R` (Rotate Mode).

## exit code

| Exit Code | Meaning                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 0         | Exited normally                     |
| 1         | No Match found                      |
| 130       | Aborted by Ctrl-C/Ctrl-G/ESC/etc... |

# Tools compatible with `skim`

These tools are or aim to be compatible with `skim`:

## [fzf-lua neovim plugin](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)

A [neovim](https://neovim.io) plugin allowing fzf and skim to be used in a to navigate your code.

Install it with your package manager, following the README. For instance, with `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
  &quot;ibhagwan/fzf-lua&quot;,
  -- enable `sk` support instead of the default `fzf`
  opts = {&#039;skim&#039;}
}
```

## [nu_plugin_skim](https://github.com/idanarye/nu_plugin_skim)

A [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) plugin to allow for better interaction between skim and nushell.

Following the instruction in the plugin&#039;s README, you can install it with cargo:
```nu
cargo install nu_plugin_skim
plugin add ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_skim
```

# Customization

The doc here is only a preview, please check the man page (`man sk`) for a full
list of options.

## Keymap

Specify the bindings with comma separated pairs (no space allowed). For example:

```sh
sk --bind &#039;alt-a:select-all,alt-d:deselect-all&#039;
```

Additionally, use `+` to concatenate actions, such as `execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort`.

See the _KEY BINDINGS_ section of the man page for details.

## Sort Criteria

There are five sort keys for results: `score, index, begin, end, length`. You can
specify how the records are sorted by `sk --tiebreak score,index,-begin` or any
other order you want.

## Color Scheme

You probably have your own aesthetic preferences! Fortunately, you aren&#039;t
limited to the default appearance - Skim supports comprehensive customization of its color scheme.

```sh
--color=[BASE_SCHEME][,COLOR:ANSI]
```

Skim also respects the `NO_COLOR` environment variable. Set it to anything and `sk` (and many other terminal apps) will disable all colored output. See [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) for more details.

### Available Base Color Schemes

Skim comes with several built-in color schemes that you can use as a starting point:

```sh
sk --color=dark      # Default dark theme (256 colors)
sk --color=light     # Light theme (256 colors)
sk --color=16        # Simple 16-color theme
sk --color=bw        # Minimal black &amp; white theme (no colors, just styles)
sk --color=none      # Minimal black &amp; white theme (no colors, no styles)
sk --color=molokai   # Molokai-inspired theme (256 colors)
```

### Customizing Colors

You can customize individual UI elements by specifying color values after the base scheme:

```sh
sk --color=light,fg:232,bg:255,current_bg:116,info:27
```

Colors can be specified in several ways:

- ANSI colors (0-255): `sk --color=fg:232,bg:255`
- RGB hex values: `sk --color=fg:#FF0000` (red text)

### Available Color Customization Options

The following UI elements can be customized:

| Element            | Description                                 | Example                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `fg`               | Normal text foreground color                | `--color=fg:232`               |
| `bg`               | Normal text background color                | `--color=bg:255`               |
| `matched`          | Matched text in search results              | `--color=matched:108`          |
| `matched_bg`       | Background of matched text                  | `--color=matched_bg:0`         |
| `current`          | Current line foreground color               | `--color=current:254`          |
| `current_bg`       | Current line background color               | `--color=current_bg:236`       |
| `current_match`    | Matched text in current line                | `--color=current_match:151`    |
| `current_match_bg` | Background of matched text in current line  | `--color=current_match_bg:236` |
| `spinner`          | Progress indicator color                    | `--color=spinner:148`          |
| `info`             | Information line color                      | `--color=info:144`             |
| `prompt`           | Prompt color                                | `--color=prompt:110`           |
| `cursor`           | Cursor color                                | `--color=cursor:161`           |
| `selected`         | Selected item marker color                  | `--color=selected:168`         |
| `header`           | Header text color                           | `--color=header:109`           |
| `border`           | Border color for preview/layout             | `--color=border:59`            |

### Examples

```sh
# Use light theme but change the current line background
sk --color=light,current_bg:24

# Custom theme with multiple colors
sk --color=dark,matched:#00FF00,current:#FFFFFF,current_bg:#000080

# High contrast theme
sk --color=fg:232,bg:255,matched:160,current:255,current_bg:20
```

For more details, check the man page (`man sk`).

## Misc

- `--ansi`: to parse ANSI color codes (e.g., `\e[32mABC`) of the data source
- `--regex`: use the query as regular expression to match the data source

# Advanced Topics

## Interactive mode

In **interactive mode**, you can invoke a command dynamically. Try it out:

```sh
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;rg --color=always --line-number &quot;{}&quot;&#039;
```

### How does it work?

![How Skim&#039;s interactive mode works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1527040/53381293-461ce380-39ab-11e9-8e86-7c3bbfd557bc.png)

- Skim  accepts two kinds of sources: Command output or piped input
- Skim has two kinds of prompts: A query prompt to specify the query pattern and a
    command prompt to specify the &quot;arguments&quot; of the command
- `-c` is used to specify the command to execute and defaults to `SKIM_DEFAULT_COMMAND`
- `-i` tells skim to open command prompt on startup, which will show `c&gt;` by default.

To further narrow down the results returned by the command, press
`Ctrl-Q` to toggle interactive mode.

## Executing external programs

You can configure key bindings to start external processes without leaving Skim (`execute`, `execute-silent`).

```sh
# Press F1 to open the file with less without leaving skim
# Press CTRL-Y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts skim (requires pbcopy)
sk --bind &#039;f1:execute(less -f {}),ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort&#039;
```

## Preview Window

This is a great feature of fzf that skim borrows. For example, we use &#039;ag&#039; to
find the matched lines, and once we narrow down to the target lines, we want to
finally decide which lines to pick by checking the context around the line.
`grep` and `ag` have the option `--context`, and skim can make use of `--context` for
a better preview window. For example:

```sh
sk --ansi -i -c &#039;ag --color &quot;{}&quot;&#039; --preview &quot;preview.sh {}&quot;
```

(Note that [preview.sh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim/blob/master/bin/preview.sh) is a script to print the context given filename:lines:columns)

You get things like this:

![preview demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1527040/30677573-0cee622e-9ebf-11e7-8316-c741324ecb3a.png)

### How does it work?

If the preview command is given by the `--preview` option, skim will replace the
`{}` with the current highlighted line surrounded by single quotes, call the
command to get the output, and print the output on the preview window.

Sometimes you don&#039;t need the whole line for invoking the command. In this case
you can use `{}`, `{1..}`, `{..3}` or `{1..5}` to select the fields. The
syntax is explained in the section [Fields Support](#filds-support).

Lastly, you might want to configure the position of preview window with `--preview-window`:
- `--preview-window up:30%` to put the window in the up position with height
    30% of the total height of skim.
- `--preview-window left:10:wrap` to specify the `wrap` allows the preview
    window to wrap the output of the preview command.
- `--preview-window wrap:hidden` to hide the preview window at startup, later
    it can be shown by the action `toggle-preview`.

## Fields support

Normally only plugin users need to understand this.

For example, you have the data source with the format:

```sh
&lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line number&gt;:&lt;column number&gt;
```

However, you want to search `&lt;filename&gt;` only when typing in queries. That
means when you type `21`, you want to find a `&lt;filename&gt;` that contains `21`,
but not matching line number or column number.

You can use `sk --delimiter &#039;:&#039; --nth 1` to achieve this.

You can also use `--with-nth` to re-arrange the order of fields.

**Range Syntax**

- `&lt;num&gt;` -- to specify the `num`-th fields, starting with 1.
- `start..` -- starting from the `start`-th fields and the rest.
- `..end` -- starting from the `0`-th field, all the way to `end`-th field,
    including `end`.
- `start..end` -- starting from `start`-th field, all the way to `end`-th
    field, including `end`.

## Use as a library

Skim can be used as a library in your Rust crates.

First, add skim into your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
skim = { version = &quot;&lt;version&gt;&quot;, default-features = false, features = [..] }
```

_Note on features_:
    - the `cli` feature is required to use skim as a cli, it *should* not be needed when using it as a library.
    - the `nightly-frizbee` feature adds the frizbee algorithm, but requires cargo nigthly.

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it&#039;s a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB&#039;s Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git&#039;s user interface hasn&#039;t been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed
- **Easy Commit Management**
  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping
- **Undo Timeline**
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation
- **GitHub Integration**
  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more
- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

## Example Uses

### Fixing a Bug While Working on a Feature

&gt; Say that while developing a feature, you encounter a bug that you wish to fix. It&#039;s often desirable that you ship the fix as a separate contribution (Pull request).

Using Git you can stash your changes and switch to another branch, where you can commit, and push your fix.

_With GitButler_ you simply assign your fix to a separate virtual branch, which you can individually push (or directly create a PR). An additional benefit is that you can retain the fix in your working directory while waiting for CI and/or code review.

### Trying Someone Else&#039;s Branch Together With My Work in Progress

&gt; Say you want to test a branch from someone else for the purpose of code review.

Using Git trying out someone else&#039;s branch is a full context switch away from your own work.
_With GitButler_ you can apply and unapply (add / remove) any remote branch directly into your working directory.

## Documentation

You can find our end user documentation at: &lt;https://docs.gitbutler.com&gt;

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),
or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).

## AI Commit Message Generation

Commit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.

Currently, GitButler uses OpenAI&#039;s API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI&#039;s servers.

Our goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).

__Cube Core is an open-source semantic layer.__ Cube Core can be used to build embedded analytics in your applications, create your own business intelligence tool or provide context about data to AI agents. Cube Core is headless and comes with multiple APIs for embedded analytics and BI: REST, GraphQL, and SQL.

If you are looking for a fully integrated platform, check out [Cube](https://cube.dev), a modern AI-first business intelligence platform. We use Cube Core to power it.

  &lt;i&gt;Learn more about connecting Cube to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases?ref=github-readme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data sources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cube.dev/docs/config/downstream?ref=github-readme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analytics &amp; visualization tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Cube Core was designed to work with all SQL data sources, including cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery; query engines like Presto and Amazon Athena; and application databases like Postgres. Cube Core has a built-in relational caching engine to provide sub-second latency and high concurrency for API requests.

## Why Cube Core?

Every business intelligence tool relies on a semantic layer as its core engine—a critical component that defines metrics, dimensions, and business logic while abstracting the complexity of underlying data sources. However, most semantic layers are proprietary, tightly coupled to specific BI platforms, and cannot be reused across different applications.

Cube Core is an open-source project that aims to create an open, modern semantic layer that can be used to power any analytics applications and AI agents. By decoupling the semantic layer from specific tools and making it accessible through standard APIs, Cube Core enables organizations to define their metrics once and use them everywhere—from BI tools to embedded analytics to AI agents.

## Getting Started 🚀

You can get started with Cube locally or self-host it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Once Docker is installed, in a new folder for your project, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -p 15432:15432 \
  -v ${PWD}:/cube/conf \
  -e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \
  cubejs/cube
```

Then, open http://localhost:4000 in your browser to continue setup.

For a step-by-step guide, [see the docs](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started-docker?ref=github-readme).

## What does this do?

This is a cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and Windows.
A short summary of the features:

- multiple layers of key functionality
- advanced key behaviour customization (e.g. tap-hold, macros, unicode)

To see all of the features, see the [configuration guide](./docs/config.adoc).

You can find pre-built binaries in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
or read on for build instructions.

You can see a [list of known issues here](./docs/platform-known-issues.adoc).

### Demo

#### Demo video
[Showcase of multi-layer functionality (30s, 1.7 MB)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6634136/183001314-f64a7e26-4129-4f20-bf26-7165a6e02c38.mp4).

#### Online simulator

You can check out the [online simulator](https://jtroo.github.io)
to test configuration validity and test input simulation.

## Why is this useful?

Imagine if, instead of pressing Shift to type uppercase letters, we had giant
keyboards with separate keys for lowercase and uppercase letters. I hope we can
all agree: that would be a terrible user experience!

A way to think of how Shift keys work is that they switch your input to another
layer of functionality where you now type uppercase letters and symbols
instead of lowercase letters and numbers.

What kanata allows you to do is take this alternate layer concept that Shift
keys have and apply it to any key. You can then customize what those layers do
to suit your exact needs and workflows.

## Usage

Running kanata currently does not start it in a background process.
You will need to keep the window that starts kanata running to keep kanata active.
Some tips for running kanata in the background:

- Windows: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/193
- Linux: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/130#discussioncomment-10227272
- Run from tray icon: [kanata-tray](https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray)

### Pre-built executables

See the
[releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases)
for executables and instructions.

### Build it yourself

This project uses the latest Rust stable toolchain. If you installed the
Rust toolchain using `rustup`, e.g. by using the instructions from the
[official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started),
you can get the latest stable toolchain with `rustup update stable`.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

Using `cargo install`:

    cargo install kanata

    # On Linux and macOS, this may not work without `sudo`, see below
    kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is used because kanata opens /dev/ files
    #
    # See below if you want to avoid needing sudo:
    # https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/wiki/Avoid-using-sudo-on-Linux
    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in Windows.

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive
    target\debug\kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

Build and run yourself in macOS:

First install the Karabiner driver by following the macOS documentation
in the [releases page](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/releases/).

Then you can compile and run with the instructions below:

    git clone https://github.com/jtroo/kanata &amp;&amp; cd kanata
    cargo build   # --release optional, not really perf sensitive

    # sudo is needed to gain permission to intercept the keyboard

    sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg &lt;your_configuration_file&gt;

The full configuration guide is [found here](./docs/config.adoc).

Sample configuration files are found in [cfg_samples](./cfg_samples). The
[simple.kbd](./cfg_samples/simple.kbd) file contains a basic configuration file
that is hopefully easy to understand but does not contain all features. The
`kanata.kbd` contains an example of all features with documentation. The
release assets also have a `kanata.kbd` file that is tested to work with that
release. All key names can be found in the [keys module](./parser/src/keys/mod.rs),
and you can also define your own key names.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Feature flags

When either building yourself or using `cargo install`,
you can add feature flags that
enable functionality that is turned off by default.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Instructions&lt;/summary&gt;

If you want to enable the `cmd` actions,
add the flag `--features cmd`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd
cargo install --features cmd
```

On Windows,
if you want to compile a binary that uses the Interception driver,
you should add the flag `--features interception_driver`.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features interception_driver
cargo install --features interception_driver
```

To combine multiple flags,
use a single `--features` flag
and use a comma to separate the features.
For example:

```
cargo build --release --features cmd,interception_driver
cargo install --features cmd,interception_driver
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## What does the name mean?

I wanted a &quot;k&quot; word since this relates to keyboards. According to Wikipedia,
kanata is an indigenous Iroquoian word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; and is
the origin of Canada&#039;s name.

There&#039;s also PPT✧.

## Motivation

TLDR: QMK features but for any keyboard, not just fancy mechanical ones.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Long version&lt;/summary&gt;

I have a few keyboards that run [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/). QMK allows the
user to customize the functionality of their keyboard to their heart&#039;s content.

One great use case of QMK is its ability map keys so that they overlap with the
home row keys but are accessible on another layer. I won&#039;t comment on
productivity, but I find this greatly helps with my keyboard comfort.

For example, these keys are on the right side of the keyboard:

    7 8 9
    u i o
    j k l
    m , .

On one layer I have arrow keys in the same position, and on another layer I
have a numpad.

    arrows:       numpad:
    - - -         7 8 9
    - ↑ -         4 5 6
    ← ↓ →         1 2 3
    - - -         0 * .

One could add as many customizations as one likes to improve comfort, speed,
etc. Personally my main motivator is comfort due to a repetitive strain injury
in the past.

However, QMK doesn&#039;t run everywhere. In fact, it doesn&#039;t run on **most**
hardware you can get. You can&#039;t get it to run on a laptop keyboard or any
mainstream office keyboard. I believe that the comfort and empowerment QMK
provides should be available to anyone with a computer on their existing
hardware, instead of having to purchase an enthusiast mechanical keyboard
(which are admittedly very nice — I own a few — but can be costly).

The best alternative solution that I found for keyboards that don&#039;t run QMK was
[kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad). This is an excellent project
and I recommend it if you want to try something similar.

The reason for this project&#039;s existence is that kmonad is written in Haskell
and I have no idea how to begin contributing to a Haskell project. From an
outsider&#039;s perspective I think Haskell is a great language but I really can&#039;t
wrap my head around it. And there are a few [outstanding issues](./docs/kmonad_comparison.md)
at the time of writing that make kmonad suboptimal for my personal workflows.

This project is written in Rust because Rust is my favourite programming
language and the prior work of the awesome [keyberon crate](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon)
exists.
&lt;/details&gt;

## Similar Projects

The most similar project is [kmonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad),

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Fresh

A terminal-based text editor. [Official Website →](https://sinelaw.github.io/fresh/)

**[📦 Installation Instructions](#installation)**

**[Contributing](#contributing)**

## Why?

Why another text editor? Fresh brings the intuitive, conventional UX of editors like VS Code and Sublime Text to the terminal.

While veterans like Emacs and Vim - and newer editors like Neovim and Helix - are excellent for power users who prefer modal, highly specialized workflows, they often present a steep learning curve for those used to standard GUI interactions. Fresh is built for the developer who wants a familiar, non-modal experience out-of-the-box, without sacrificing the speed and portability of the command line. Keyboard bindings, mouse support, menus, command palette etc. are all designed to be familiar to most modern users.

Architecturally, Fresh is built to handle multi-gigabyte files or slow network streams efficiently, maintaining a negligible memory overhead regardless of file size. While traditional editors struggle with latency and RAM bloat on large files, Fresh delivers consistent, high-speed performance on any scale.

The goal for Fresh is to be an intuitive and accessible, high-performance terminal-based editor that &quot;just works&quot; on any hardware, for everyone.

## Discovery &amp; Ease of Use

Fresh is designed for discovery. It features native UIs, a full Menu system, and a powerful Command Palette. With full mouse support, transitioning from graphical editors is seamless.

## Modern Extensibility

Extend Fresh easily using modern tools. Plugins are written in TypeScript and run securely in a sandboxed Deno environment, providing access to a modern JavaScript ecosystem without compromising stability.

## Low-Latency Performance

Fresh is engineered for speed. It delivers a low-latency experience, with text appearing instantly. The editor is designed to be light and fast, reliably opening and editing [huge files up to multi-gigabyte sizes](https://noamlewis.com/blog/2025/12/09/how-fresh-loads-huge-files-fast) without slowdown.

## Comprehensive Feature Set

- **File Management**: open/save/new/close, file explorer, tabs, auto-revert, git file finder
- **Editing**: undo/redo, multi-cursor, block selection, smart indent, comments, clipboard
- **Search &amp; Replace**: incremental search, find in selection, query replace, git grep
- **Navigation**: go to line/bracket, word movement, position history, bookmarks, error navigation
- **Views &amp; Layout**: split panes, line numbers, line wrap, backgrounds, markdown preview
- **Language Server (LSP)**: go to definition, references, hover, code actions, rename, diagnostics, autocompletion
- **Productivity**: command palette, menu bar, keyboard macros, git log, diagnostics panel
- **Plugins &amp; Extensibility**: TypeScript plugins, color highlighter, TODO highlighter, merge conflicts, path complete, keymaps
- **Internationalization**: Multiple language support (see [`locales/`](locales/) for available languages), plugin translation system

### Brew

On macOS and some linux distros (Bazzite/Bluefin/Aurora):

&gt; **Note:** On macOS, see [macOS Terminal Tips](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#macos-terminal-tips) for recommended terminal configuration.

```bash
brew tap sinelaw/fresh
brew install fresh-editor
```

### Arch Linux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fresh-editor-bin))

**Binary package (recommended, faster install):**

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/fresh-editor-bin.git
cd fresh-editor-bin
makepkg --syncdeps --install
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/fresh-editor.git
cd fresh-editor
makepkg --syncdeps --install
```

**Using an AUR helper (such as `yay` or `paru`):**

```bash
# Binary package (recommended, faster install)
yay -S fresh-editor-bin

# Or build from source
yay -S fresh-editor
```

### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)

Download and install the latest release:

```bash
curl -sL $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/sinelaw/fresh/releases/latest | grep &quot;browser_download_url.*_$(dpkg --print-architecture)\.deb&quot; | cut -d &#039;&quot;&#039; -f 4) -o fresh-editor.deb &amp;&amp; sudo dpkg -i fresh-editor.deb
```

Or download the `.deb` file manually from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases).

### Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE (.rpm)

Download and install the latest release:

```bash
curl -sL $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/sinelaw/fresh/releases/latest | grep &quot;browser_download_url.*\.$(uname -m)\.rpm&quot; | cut -d &#039;&quot;&#039; -f 4) -o fresh-editor.rpm &amp;&amp; sudo rpm -U fresh-editor.rpm
```

Or download the `.rpm` file manually from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases).

### AppImage

Download the `.AppImage` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases) and run:

```bash
chmod +x fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage
./fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage
```

**For faster startup** (recommended): Extract the AppImage instead of running it directly. This avoids the FUSE mount overhead on each launch (~10x faster):

```bash
./fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fresh-editor ~/.local/bin
mv squashfs-root/* ~/.local/share/fresh-editor/
ln -sf ~/.local/share/fresh-editor/usr/bin/fresh ~/.local/bin/fresh
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Available for x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.

### Flatpak

Download the `.flatpak` bundle from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases) and install:

```bash
flatpak install --user fresh-editor-VERSION-x86_64.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.sinelaw.fresh
```

See [flatpak/README.md](flatpak/README.md) for building from source.

### Pre-built binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/releases).

### npm

```bash
npm install -g @fresh-editor/fresh-editor
```

Or try it without installing:

```bash
npx @fresh-editor/fresh-editor
```

### Using cargo-binstall

To install the binary directly without compiling (much faster than crates.io):

First, install cargo-binstall if you haven&#039;t already

```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
```

Then install fresh

```bash
cargo binstall fresh-editor
```

### Nix flakes

Run without installing:
```bash
nix run github:sinelaw/fresh
```

Or install to your profile:
```bash
nix profile add github:sinelaw/fresh
```

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install fresh-editor
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh.git
cd fresh
cargo build --release
./target/release/fresh [file]
```

## Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

1. **Reproduce Before Fixing**: Always include a test case that reproduces the bug (fails) without the fix, and passes with the fix. This ensures the issue is verified and prevents future regressions.

2. **E2E Tests for New Flows**: Any new user flow or feature must include an end-to-end (e2e) test. E2E tests send keyboard/mouse events and examines the final rendered output, do not examine internal state.

3. **No timeouts or time-sensitive tests**: Use &quot;semantic waiting&quot; (waiting for specific state changes/events) instead of fixed timers to ensure test stability. Wait indefinitely, don&#039;t put timeouts inside tests (cargo nextest will timeout externally).

4. **Test isolation**: Tests should run in parallel. Use the internal clipboard mode in tests to isolate them from the host system and prevent flakiness in CI. Same for other external resources (temp files, etc. should all be isolated between tests, under a per-test temporary workdir).

5. **Required Formatting**: All code must be formatted with `cargo fmt` before submission. PRs that fail formatting checks will not be merged.

6. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Avoid hard-coding newline or CRLF related logic, consider the buffer mode.

7. **LSP**: Ensure LSP interactions follow the correct lifecycle (e.g., `didOpen` must always precede other requests to avoid server-side errors). Use the appropriate existing helpers for this pattern.

8. **Regenerate plugin types**: After modifying the plugin API, run `cargo test -p fresh-plugin-runtime write_fresh_dts_file -- --ignored`

9. **Type check plugins**: Run `crates/fresh-editor/plugins/check-types.sh` (requires `tsc`)

**Tip**: You can use tmux + send-keys + render-pane to script ad-hoc tests on the UI, for example when trying to reproduce an issue.

## Privacy

Fresh checks for new versions daily to notify you of available upgrades. Alongside this, it sends basic anonymous telemetry (version, OS/architecture, terminal type) to help understand usage patterns. No personal data or file contents are collected.

To disable both upgrade checks and telemetry, use `--no-upgrade-check` or set `check_for_updates: false` in your config.
