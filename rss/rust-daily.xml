## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).

    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/transformation.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Transformation&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

CocoIndex makes it super easy to transform data with AI workloads, and keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/venn-features.png&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot; width=&#039;400&#039;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;

Either creating embedding, building knowledge graphs, or any data transformations - beyond traditional SQL.

## Exceptional velocity
Just declare transformation in dataflow with ~100 lines of python

```python
# import
data[&#039;content&#039;] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data[&#039;out&#039;] = data[&#039;content&#039;]
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, developers don&#039;t explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. They just need to define transformation/formula for a set of source data.

## Build like LEGO
Native builtins for different source, targets and transformations. Standardize interface, make it 1-line code switch between different components.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://cocoindex.io/images/components.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CocoIndex Features&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Data Freshness
CocoIndex keep source data and target in sync effortlessly.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4eb29b3-84ee-4fa0-a1e2-80eedeeabde6&quot; alt=&quot;Incremental Processing&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It has out-of-box support for incremental indexing:
- minimal recomputation on source or logic change.
- (re-)processing necessary portions; reuse cache when possible

## Quick Start:
If you&#039;re new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out
- üìñ [Documentation](https://cocoindex.io/docs)
- ‚ö°  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- üé¨ [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```bash
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don&#039;t have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.


## Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name=&quot;TextEmbedding&quot;)
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path=&quot;markdown_files&quot;))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope[&quot;documents&quot;].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc[&quot;chunks&quot;] = doc[&quot;content&quot;].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language=&quot;markdown&quot;, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc[&quot;chunks&quot;].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;] = chunk[&quot;text&quot;].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model=&quot;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&quot;))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc[&quot;filename&quot;], location=chunk[&quot;location&quot;],
                                   text=chunk[&quot;text&quot;], embedding=chunk[&quot;embedding&quot;])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        &quot;doc_embeddings&quot;,
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=[&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;location&quot;],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name=&quot;embedding&quot;,
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:

------------
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use `rg -uuu`.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for [every
release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases). ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### Quick examples comparing tools

This example searches the entire
[Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/BurntSushi/linux)
(after running `make defconfig &amp;&amp; make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where
all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i9-12900K 5.2 GHz.

Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
[blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/)
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | **0.082s** (1.00x) |
| [hypergrep](https://github.com/p-ranav/hypergrep) | `hgrep -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.167s (2.04x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `git grep -P -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.273s (3.34x) |
| [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 534 | 0.443s (5.43x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r --ignore-files --no-hidden -I -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.639s (7.82x) |
| [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 0.727s (8.91x) |
| [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 536 | 2.670s (32.70x) |
| [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3) | `ack -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 2677 | 2.935s (35.94x) |

Here&#039;s another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg -uuu -tc -n -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | **0.063s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.607s (9.62x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `grep -E -r -n --include=&#039;*.c&#039; --include=&#039;*.h&#039; -w &#039;[A-Z]+_SUSPEND&#039;` | 447 | 0.674s (10.69x) |

Now we&#039;ll move to searching on single large file. Here is a straight-up
comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a file cached in memory
(~13GB, [`OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2018/mono/OpenSubtitles.raw.en.gz), decompressed):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | **1.042s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 1.339s (1.28x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 egrep -w &#039;Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 7882 | 6.577s (6.31x) |

In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to `1.664s` for ripgrep and `9.484s` for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of `-n`.

Beware of performance cliffs though:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | **1.053s** (1.00x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 6.234s (5.92x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -w &#039;[A-Z]\w+ Sherlock [A-Z]\w+&#039;` | 485 | 28.973s (27.51x) |

And performance can drop precipitously across the board when searching big
files for patterns without any opportunities for literal optimizations:

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | **15.569s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 21.857s (1.40x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6749 | 32.409s (2.08x) |
| [GNU grep (Unicode)](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 grep -E &#039;[A-Za-z]{30}&#039;` | 6795 | 8m30s (32.74x) |

Finally, high match counts also tend to both tank performance and smooth
out the differences between tools (because performance is dominated by how
quickly one can handle a match and not the algorithm used to detect the match,
generally speaking):

| Tool | Command | Line count | Time |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| ripgrep | `rg the` | 83499915 | **6.948s** (1.00x) |
| [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) | `ugrep the` | 83499915 | 11.721s (1.69x) |
| [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C grep the` | 83499915 | 15.217s (2.19x) |

### Why should I use ripgrep?

* It can replace many use cases served by other search tools
  because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See
  [the FAQ](FAQ.md#posix4ever) for more details on whether ripgrep can truly
  replace grep.)
* Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to
  [recursive search](GUIDE.md#recursive-search) and does [automatic
  filtering](GUIDE.md#automatic-filtering). Namely, ripgrep won&#039;t search files
  ignored by your `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.rgignore` files, it won&#039;t search
  hidden files and it won&#039;t search binary files. Automatic filtering can be
  disabled with `rg -uuu`.
* ripgrep can [search specific types of files](GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types).
  For example, `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs
  foo` excludes JavaScript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about
  new file types with custom matching rules.
* ripgrep supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context
  of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with
  color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while
  supporting Unicode (which is always on).
* ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2.
  Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and
  backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep&#039;s default
  regex engine. PCRE2 support can be enabled with `-P/--pcre2` (use PCRE2
  always) or `--auto-hybrid-regex` (use PCRE2 only if needed). An alternative
  syntax is provided via the `--engine (default|pcre2|auto)` option.
* ripgrep has [rudimentary support for replacements](GUIDE.md#replacements),
  which permit rewriting output based on what was matched.
* ripgrep supports [searching files in text encodings](GUIDE.md#file-encoding)
  other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more.
  (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text
  encodings must be specifically specified with the `-E/--encoding` flag.)
* ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (brotli,
  bzip2, gzip, lz4, lzma, xz, or zstandard) with the `-z/--search-zip` flag.
* ripgrep supports
  [arbitrary input preprocessing filters](GUIDE.md#preprocessor)
  which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting,
  automatic encoding detection and so on.
* ripgrep can be configured via a
  [configuration file](GUIDE.md#configuration-file).

In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.


### Why shouldn&#039;t I use ripgrep?

Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.

At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:

* You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any
  standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep.
* There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that
  you rely on that&#039;s in another tool that isn&#039;t in ripgrep.
* There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn&#039;t do well where another
  tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!)
* ripgrep isn&#039;t possible to install on your machine or isn&#039;t available for your
  platform. (Please file a bug report!)


### Is it really faster than everything else?

Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is
[available on my blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Summarizing, ripgrep is fast because:

* It is built on top of
  [Rust&#039;s regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex).
  Rust&#039;s regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal
  optimizations to make searching very fast. (PCRE2 support can be opted into
  with the `-P/--pcre2` flag.)
* Rust&#039;s regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by
  building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton
  engine.
* It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally
  with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the
  latter is better for large directories. ripgrep chooses the best searching
  strategy for you automatically.
* Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a
  [`RegexSet`](https://docs.rs/regex/1/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).
  That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns
  simultaneously.
* It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of
  [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and
  [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore).


### Feature comparison

Andy Lester, author of [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), has published an
excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and
ripgrep: https://beyondgrep.com/feature-comparison/

Note that ripgrep has grown a few significant new features recently that
are not yet present in Andy&#039;s table. This includes, but is not limited to,
configuration files, passthru, support for searching compressed files,
multiline search and opt-in fancy regex support via PCRE2.

```
$ sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

(N.B. Various snaps for ripgrep on Ubuntu are also available, but none of them
seem to work right and generate a number of very strange bug reports that I
don&#039;t know how to fix and don&#039;t have the time to fix. Therefore, it is no
longer a recommended installation option.)

If you&#039;re an **ALT** user, you can install ripgrep from the

If you&#039;re a **Rust programmer**, ripgrep can be installed with `cargo`.

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.88.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

Alternatively, one can use [`cargo
binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install a ripgrep
binary directly from GitHub:

```
$ cargo binstall ripgrep
```


### Building

ripgrep is written in Rust, so you&#039;ll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.
ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.88.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.

To build ripgrep:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
$ cd ripgrep
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/rg --version
0.1.3
```

**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when
using a Rust nightly compiler. This only benefited UTF-16 transcoding.
Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD
optimizations for UTF-16 transcoding, then you&#039;ll have to petition the
[`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project to use stable
APIs.

Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
`pcre2` feature:

```
$ cargo build --release --features &#039;pcre2&#039;
```

Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system&#039;s PCRE2 library via
`pkg-config`. If one doesn&#039;t exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system&#039;s C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
`PCRE2_SYS_STATIC=1`.

ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your friendly neighborhood package manager).
Then you just need to add MUSL support to your Rust toolchain and rebuild
ripgrep, which yields a fully static executable:

```
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Applying the `--features` flag from above works as expected. If you want to
build a static executable with MUSL and with PCRE2, then you will need to have
`musl-gcc` installed, which might be in a separate package from the actual
MUSL library, depending on your Linux distribution.

## What is it?

- Like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but for any language) it manages [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) like node, python, cmake, terraform, and [hundreds more](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html).
- Like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) it manages [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) for different project directories.
- Like [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) it manages [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) used to build and test projects.

## Demo

The following demo shows how to install and use `mise` to manage multiple versions of `node` on the same system.
Note that calling `which node` gives us a real path to node, not a shim.

It also shows that you can use `mise` to install and many other tools such as `jq`, `terraform`, or `go`.

[![demo](./docs/tapes/demo.gif)](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

See [demo transcript](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html).

## Quickstart

### Install mise

See [Getting started](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for more options.

```sh-session
$ curl https://mise.run | sh
$ ~/.local/bin/mise --version
2025.8.9 macos-arm64 (a1b2d3e 2025-08-13)
```

Hook mise into your shell (pick the right one for your shell):

```sh-session
# note this assumes mise is located at ~/.local/bin/mise
# which is what https://mise.run does by default
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo &#039;eval &quot;$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)&quot;&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo &#039;~/.local/bin/mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Execute commands with specific tools

```sh-session
$ mise exec node@22 -- node -v
mise node@22.x.x ‚úì installed
v22.x.x
```

### Install tools

```sh-session
$ mise use --global node@22 go@1
$ node -v
v22.x.x
$ go version
go version go1.x.x macos/arm64
```

See [dev tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/) for more examples.

### Manage environment variables

```toml
# mise.toml
[env]
SOME_VAR = &quot;foo&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise set SOME_VAR=bar
$ echo $SOME_VAR
bar
```

Note that `mise` can also [load `.env` files](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/#env-directives).

### Run tasks

```toml
# mise.toml
[tasks.build]
description = &quot;build the project&quot;
run = &quot;echo building...&quot;
```

```sh-session
$ mise run build
building...
```

See [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) for more information.

### Example mise project

Here is a combined example to give you an idea of how you can use mise to manage your a project&#039;s tools, environment, and tasks.

```toml
# mise.toml
[tools]
terraform = &quot;1&quot;
aws-cli = &quot;2&quot;

[env]
TF_WORKSPACE = &quot;development&quot;
AWS_REGION = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
AWS_PROFILE = &quot;dev&quot;

[tasks.plan]
description = &quot;Run terraform plan with configured workspace&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
terraform init
terraform workspace select $TF_WORKSPACE
terraform plan
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.validate]
description = &quot;Validate AWS credentials and terraform config&quot;
run = &quot;&quot;&quot;
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform validate
&quot;&quot;&quot;

[tasks.deploy]
description = &quot;Deploy infrastructure after validation&quot;
depends = [&quot;validate&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;]
run = &quot;terraform apply -auto-approve&quot;
```

Run it with:

```sh-session
mise install # install tools specified in mise.toml
mise run deploy
```

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

- **General** enough to parse any programming language
- **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
- **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
- **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

A secure, stable and high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal, written in Rust

rathole, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections. See [Benchmark](#benchmark)
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. See [Benchmark](#benchmark). [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `rathole` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**. A [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapiz1/rathole) is also available.

The usage of `rathole` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `rathole`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:2333&quot; # `2333` specifies the port that rathole listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.0:5202&quot; # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = &quot;myserver.com:2333&quot; # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = &quot;use_a_secret_that_only_you_know&quot; # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = &quot;127.0.0.1:22&quot; # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./rathole client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client&#039;s port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `rathole` run as a background service on Linux, checkout the [systemd examples](./examples/systemd).

## Configuration

`rathole` can automatically determine to run in the server mode or the client mode, according to the content of the configuration file, if only one of `[server]` and `[client]` block is present, like the example in [Quickstart](#quickstart).

But the `[client]` and `[server]` block can also be put in one file. Then on the server side, run `rathole --server config.toml` and on the client side, run `rathole --client config.toml` to explicitly tell `rathole` the running mode.

Before heading to the full configuration specification, it&#039;s recommend to skim [the configuration examples](./examples) to get a feeling of the configuration format.

See [Transport](./docs/transport.md) for more details about encryption and the `transport` block.

Here is the full configuration specification:

retry_interval = 1 # Optional. The interval between retry to connect to the server. Default: 1 second

[client.transport] # The whole block is optional. Specify which transport to use

nodelay = true # Optional. Same as the client

[server.services.service2]
bind_addr = &quot;0.0.0.1:8082&quot;
```

### Logging

`rathole`, like many other Rust programs, use environment variables to control the logging level. `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace` are available.

```shell
RUST_LOG=error ./rathole config.toml
```

will run `rathole` with only error level logging.

If `RUST_LOG` is not present, the default logging level is `info`.

### Tuning

From v0.4.7, rathole enables TCP_NODELAY by default, which should benefit the latency and interactive applications like rdp, Minecraft servers. However, it slightly decreases the bandwidth.

If the bandwidth is more important, TCP_NODELAY can be opted out with `nodelay = false`.

## Benchmark

rathole has similar latency to [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), but can handle a more connections, provide larger bandwidth, with less memory usage.

For more details, see the separate page [Benchmark](./docs/benchmark.md).

**However, don&#039;t take it from here that `rathole` can magically make your forwarded service faster several times than before.** The benchmark is done on local loopback, indicating the performance when the task is cpu-bounded. One can gain quite a improvement if the network is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, that&#039;s not true for many users. In that case, the main benefit is lower resource consumption, while the bandwidth and the latency may not improved significantly.

[Sui](https://sui.io) is a next-generation smart contract platform with high throughput, low latency, and an asset-oriented programming model powered by the [Move programming language](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move).

## Sui Highlights

Sui offers the following benefits and capabilities:

 * Unmatched scalability, instant settlement
 * A safe smart contract language accessible to mainstream developers
 * Ability to define rich and composable on-chain assets
 * Better user experience for web3 apps

Sui is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost, programmability, and usability. As Sui approaches Mainnet launch, it will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems ‚Äì traditional and blockchain alike. Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.

## Sui Overview

Sui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.

Sui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.

Sui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.

Sui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.

Sui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.

![SP1](./assets/sp1.png)

SP1 is the fastest, most-feature complete zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that can prove the execution of arbitrary Rust (or any LLVM-compiled language) programs. SP1 makes ZK accessible to *any developer*, by making it easy to write ZKP programs in normal Rust code.

**[Install](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install)**
| [Docs](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/introduction)
| [Examples](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/tree/main/examples)
| [Telegram Chat](https://t.me/+AzG4ws-kD24yMGYx)

## Getting Started 

Today, developers can write programs, including complex, large programs like a ZK Tendermint light client or type-1 zkEVM using Reth, in Rust (with std support), generate proofs and verify them. Most Rust crates should be supported and can be used seamlessly by your program. Example programs can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/tree/main/examples) folder.

To get started, make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed. Then follow the [installation](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install) guide in the SP1 book and read the [getting started](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/quickstart) section.

## Security

SP1 has undergone audits from [Veridise](https://www.veridise.com/), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/),
and [KALOS](https://kalos.xyz/) and is recommended for production use. The audit reports are available [here](./audits).

## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

The current MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) is 1.79.

## For Contributors

Open-source is a core part of SP1&#039;s ethos and key to its advantages. We wish to cultivate a vibrant community of open-source contributors that span individuals, teams and geographies. If you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our main Telegram to chat with us. Our contributor guidelines can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). A quick overview of development tips can be found in [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

We are always looking for contributors interested in tasks big and small, including minor chores across the codebase, optimizing performance, adding precompiles for commonly used cryptographic operations, adding documentation, creating new example programs and more. Please reach out in the Telegram chat if interested!

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the projects below whose previous work has been instrumental in making this project a reality.

- [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3): The SP1&#039;s prover is powered by the Plonky3 toolkit.
- [Valida](https://github.com/valida-xyz/valida): The SP1 cross-table lookups, prover, borrow macro, and chip design, including constraints, are inspired by Valida.
- [RISC0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0): The SP1 rust toolchain, install/build scripts, and our RISCV runtime borrow code from RISC0.
- [Cairo](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/how_cairo_works/builtins.html): Cairo introduced the idea of &quot;builtins&quot; which allow zkVMs to accelerate certain operations. However, the complexity of &quot;builtins&quot; was embedded in the CPU, limiting their complexity. SP1 extends this idea by executing on a vision of easily extensible &quot;precompiles&quot; that can be added as additional tables alongside the CPU.

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- üöÄ **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- üí™ **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- üñºÔ∏è **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with √úberzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- üåü **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- üîå **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- üì° **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- üì¶ **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- üß∞ Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- üí´ Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- üîÑ Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)

&lt;hr /&gt;

Lance is a modern columnar data format that is optimized for ML workflows and datasets. Lance is perfect for:

1. Building search engines and feature stores.
2. Large-scale ML training requiring high performance IO and shuffles.
3. Storing, querying, and inspecting deeply nested data for robotics or large blobs like images, point clouds, and more.

The key features of Lance include:

* **High-performance random access:** 100x faster than Parquet without sacrificing scan performance.

* **Vector search:** find nearest neighbors in milliseconds and combine OLAP-queries with vector search.

* **Zero-copy, automatic versioning:** manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.

* **Ecosystem integrations:** Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, Ray, Spark and more on the way.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Lance is in active development and we welcome contributions. Please see our [contributing guide](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/community/contributing) for more information.

## Quick Start

**Installation**

```shell
pip install pylance
```

To install a preview release:

```shell
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/ pylance
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Preview releases are released more often than full releases and contain the
&gt; latest features and bug fixes. They receive the same level of testing as full releases.
&gt; We guarantee they will remain published and available for download for at
&gt; least 6 months. When you want to pin to a specific version, prefer a stable release.

**Converting to Lance**

```python
import lance

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.dataset

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;b&quot;: [10]})
uri = &quot;/tmp/test.parquet&quot;
tbl = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
pa.dataset.write_dataset(tbl, uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)

parquet = pa.dataset.dataset(uri, format=&#039;parquet&#039;)
lance.write_dataset(parquet, &quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
```

**Reading Lance data**
```python
dataset = lance.dataset(&quot;/tmp/test.lance&quot;)
assert isinstance(dataset, pa.dataset.Dataset)
```

**Pandas**
```python
df = dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
df
```

**DuckDB**
```python
import duckdb

# If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM dataset LIMIT 10&quot;).to_df()
```

**Vector search**

Download the sift1m subset

```shell
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz
tar -xzf sift.tar.gz
```

Convert it to Lance

```python
import lance
from lance.vector import vec_to_table
import numpy as np
import struct

nvecs = 1000000
ndims = 128
with open(&quot;sift/sift_base.fvecs&quot;, mode=&quot;rb&quot;) as fobj:
    buf = fobj.read()
    data = np.array(struct.unpack(&quot;&lt;128000000f&quot;, buf[4 : 4 + 4 * nvecs * ndims])).reshape((nvecs, ndims))
    dd = dict(zip(range(nvecs), data))

table = vec_to_table(dd)
uri = &quot;vec_data.lance&quot;
sift1m = lance.write_dataset(table, uri, max_rows_per_group=8192, max_rows_per_file=1024*1024)
```

Build the index

```python
sift1m.create_index(&quot;vector&quot;,
                    index_type=&quot;IVF_PQ&quot;,
                    num_partitions=256,  # IVF
                    num_sub_vectors=16)  # PQ
```

Search the dataset

```python
# Get top 10 similar vectors
import duckdb

dataset = lance.dataset(uri)

# Sample 100 query vectors. If this segfaults, make sure you have duckdb v0.7+ installed
sample = duckdb.query(&quot;SELECT vector FROM dataset USING SAMPLE 100&quot;).to_df()
query_vectors = np.array([np.array(x) for x in sample.vector])

# Get nearest neighbors for all of them
rs = [dataset.to_table(nearest={&quot;column&quot;: &quot;vector&quot;, &quot;k&quot;: 10, &quot;q&quot;: q})
      for q in query_vectors]
```

## What makes Lance different

Here we will highlight a few aspects of Lance‚Äôs design. For more details, see the full [Lance design document](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/format).

**Vector index**: Vector index for similarity search over embedding space.
Support both CPUs (``x86_64`` and ``arm``) and GPU (``Nvidia (cuda)`` and ``Apple Silicon (mps)``).

**Encodings**: To achieve both fast columnar scan and sub-linear point queries, Lance uses custom encodings and layouts.

**Nested fields**: Lance stores each subfield as a separate column to support efficient filters like ‚Äúfind images where detected objects include cats‚Äù.

**Versioning**: A Manifest can be used to record snapshots. Currently we support creating new versions automatically via appends, overwrites, and index creation.

**Fast updates** (ROADMAP): Updates will be supported via write-ahead logs.

**Rich secondary indices**: Support `BTree`, `Bitmap`, `Full text search`, `Label list`,
`NGrams`, and more.

## Benchmarks

### Vector search

We used the SIFT dataset to benchmark our results with 1M vectors of 128D

1. For 100 randomly sampled query vectors, we get &lt;1ms average response time (on a 2023 m2 MacBook Air)

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/avg_latency.png)

2. ANNs are always a trade-off between recall and performance

![avg_latency.png](docs/src/images/recall_vs_latency.png)

### Vs. parquet

We create a Lance dataset using the Oxford Pet dataset to do some preliminary performance testing of Lance as compared to Parquet and raw image/XMLs. For analytics queries, Lance is 50-100x better than reading the raw metadata. For batched random access, Lance is 100x better than both parquet and raw files.

## Why are you building yet another data format?!

The machine learning development cycle involves the steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --&gt; B[Exploration];
    B --&gt; C[Analytics];
    C --&gt; D[Feature Engineer];
    D --&gt; E[Training];
    E --&gt; F[Evaluation];
    F --&gt; C;
    E --&gt; G[Deployment];
    G --&gt; H[Monitoring];
    H --&gt; A;
```

People use different data representations to varying stages for the performance or limited by the tooling available.
Academia mainly uses XML / JSON for annotations and zipped images/sensors data for deep learning, which
is difficult to integrate into data infrastructure and slow to train over cloud storage.
While industry uses data lakes (Parquet-based techniques, i.e., Delta Lake, Iceberg) or data warehouses (AWS Redshift
or Google BigQuery) to collect and analyze data, they have to convert the data into training-friendly formats, such
as [Rikai](https://github.com/eto-ai/rikai)/[Petastorm](https://github.com/uber/petastorm)
or [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord).
Multiple single-purpose data transforms, as well as syncing copies between cloud storage to local training
instances have become a common practice.

While each of the existing data formats excels at the workload it was originally designed for, we need a new data format
tailored for multistage ML development cycles to reduce and data silos.

A comparison of different data formats in each stage of ML development cycle.

## Python

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import polars as pl
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pl.DataFrame(
...     {
...         &quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],

&gt;&gt;&gt; pl.sql(&quot;&quot;&quot;
... SELECT df.species,
...     AVG(df.sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length,
...     df2.blooming_season
... FROM df
... LEFT JOIN df2 ON df.species = df2.species
... GROUP BY df.species, df2.blooming_season
... &quot;&quot;&quot;).collect()
```

SQL commands can also be run directly from your terminal using the Polars CLI:

```bash
# run an inline SQL query
&gt; polars -c &quot;SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;&quot;

# run interactively
&gt; polars
Polars CLI v0.3.0
Type .help for help.

&gt; SELECT species, AVG(sepal_length) AS avg_sepal_length, AVG(sepal_width) AS avg_sepal_width FROM read_csv(&#039;docs/assets/data/iris.csv&#039;) GROUP BY species;
```

Refer to the [Polars CLI repository](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars-cli) for more information.

## Performance üöÄüöÄ

### Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the
[PDS-H benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) results.

### Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the
import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### Handles larger-than-RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, Polars&#039; query engine is able to process your query
(or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion. This drastically reduces memory requirements, so
you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect with
`collect(engine=&#039;streaming&#039;)` to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is
still very fast!)

## Setup

### Python

Install the latest Polars version with:

```sh
pip install polars
```

We also have a conda package (`conda install -c conda-forge polars`), however pip is the preferred
way to install Polars.

Install Polars with all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[all]&#039;
```

You can also install a subset of all optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install &#039;polars[numpy,pandas,pyarrow]&#039;
```

See the [User Guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/installation/#feature-flags) for more details
on optional dependencies

To see the current Polars version and a full list of its optional dependencies, run:

```python
pl.show_versions()
```

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating Polars regularly to
get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Rust

You can take latest release from `crates.io`, or if you want to use the latest features /
performance improvements point to the `main` branch of this repo.

```toml
polars = { git = &quot;https://github.com/pola-rs/polars&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;optional git tag&gt;&quot; }
```

Requires Rust version `&gt;=1.80`.

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Read our [contributing guide](https://docs.pola.rs/development/contributing/).

## Python: compile Polars from source

If you want a bleeding edge release or maximal performance you should compile Polars from source.

This can be done by going through the following steps in sequence:

1. Install the latest [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [maturin](https://maturin.rs/): `pip install maturin`
3. `cd py-polars` and choose one of the following:
   - `make build`, slow binary with debug assertions and symbols, fast compile times
   - `make build-release`, fast binary without debug assertions, minimal debug symbols, long compile
     times
   - `make build-nodebug-release`, same as build-release but without any debug symbols, slightly
     faster to compile
   - `make build-debug-release`, same as build-release but with full debug symbols, slightly slower
     to compile
   - `make build-dist-release`, fastest binary, extreme compile times

By default the binary is compiled with optimizations turned on for a modern CPU. Specify `LTS_CPU=1`
with the command if your CPU is older and does not support e.g. AVX2.

Note that the Rust crate implementing the Python bindings is called `py-polars` to distinguish from
the wrapped Rust crate `polars` itself. However, both the Python package and the Python module are
named `polars`, so you can `pip install polars` and `import polars`.

## Using custom Rust functions in Python

Extending Polars with UDFs compiled in Rust is easy. We expose PyO3 extensions for `DataFrame` and
`Series` data structures. See more in https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/pyo3-polars.

## Going big...

Do you expect more than 2^32 (~4.2 billion) rows? Compile Polars with the `bigidx` feature flag or,
for Python users, install `pip install polars-u64-idx`.

Don&#039;t use this unless you hit the row boundary as the default build of Polars is faster and consumes
less memory.

## Legacy

Do you want Polars to run on an old CPU (e.g. dating from before 2011), or on an `x86-64` build of
Python on Apple Silicon under Rosetta? Install `pip install polars-lts-cpu`. This version of Polars
is compiled without [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) target features.

# Building

## **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

When building a specific release branch, you should check the rust version in `ci/rust-version.sh` and if necessary, install that version by running:

```bash
$ rustup install VERSION
```

Note that if this is not the latest rust version on your machine, cargo commands may require an [override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in order to use the correct version.

On Linux systems you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

On Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openssl-devel systemd-devel pkg-config zlib-devel llvm clang cmake make protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler perl-core
```

## **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana.git
$ cd solana
```

## **3. Build.**

```bash
$ ./cargo build
```

# Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ ./cargo test
```

### Starting a local testnet

Start your own testnet locally, instructions are in the [online docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters/benchmark).

### Accessing the remote development cluster

- `devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  devnet.solana.com. Runs 24/7. Learn more about the [public clusters](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters)

# Benchmarking

First, install the nightly build of rustc. `cargo bench` requires the use of the
unstable features only available in the nightly build.

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks:

```bash
$ cargo +nightly bench
```

# Release Process

The release process for this project is described [here](RELEASE.md).

# Code coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it&#039;s a _solution_ to
some problem. Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of _problems_ the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn&#039;t _infringe_ on anyone else&#039;s solutions. Adding a
test _protects_ your solution from future changes. Say you don&#039;t understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, &quot;what
problem is solved by this code?&quot; On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it&#039;s protecting, please
send us that patch!

## What is Bevy?

Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

Bevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can&#039;t guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.

**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to &quot;the latest stable release&quot; of Rust.

## Design Goals

* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don&#039;t like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn&#039;t fun

### Contributing

If you&#039;d like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor&#039;s Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.
For simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or
[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!

For more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!

## Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.

Follow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
Once set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)
git checkout latest
# Runs the &quot;breakout&quot; example
cargo run --example breakout
```

To draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
}
```

### Fast Compiles

Bevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the &quot;fast compiles&quot; setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).

## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]

This [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.

This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.

Some of the engine&#039;s code carries additional copyright notices and license terms due to their external origins.
These are generally BSD-like, but exact details vary by crate:
If the README of a crate contains a &#039;License&#039; header (or similar), the additional copyright notices and license terms applicable to that crate will be listed.
The above licensing requirement still applies to contributions to those crates, and sections of those crates will carry those license terms.
The [license](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) field of each crate will also reflect this.

The [assets](assets) included in this repository (for our [examples](./examples/README.md)) typically fall under different open licenses.
These will not be included in your game (unless copied in by you), and they are not distributed in the published bevy crates.

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html

&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; alt=&quot;prek&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a87815a-9f3c-48e7-8c1d-384b07ad3b35&quot; /&gt;

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the
language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.

prek is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust.
It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it,
while also providing some additional long-requested features.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; This project was previously named `prefligit`, but it has been renamed to `prek` to avoid typosquatting issues.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; This project is still in early stage of development, some features are still not implemented.
&gt; It is not production-ready yet, but feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
&gt;
&gt; Current supported languages are `python`, `node`, `go`, `docker`, `docker-image`, `pygrep`, `system`, `script` and `fail`.

## Features

- üöÄ A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.
- ‚ö° About [10x faster](https://github.com/j178/prek/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md) than `pre-commit` and uses only a third of disk space.
- üîÑ Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.
- üêç Integration with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.
- üì¶ Built-in implementation of some common hooks.
- üèóÔ∏è (TODO) Built-in support for monorepos.

## How to migrate

prek is designed as a drop-in replacement:

- [Install prek](#installation)
- Replace `pre-commit` with `prek` in your commands
- Your existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` works unchanged

```console
$ prek run
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
typos....................................................................Passed
cargo fmt................................................................Passed
cargo clippy.............................................................Passed
```

For configuring `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and writing hooks, you can refer to the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) as prek is fully compatible with it.

## Why prek?

### prek is way faster

- It is about [10x faster](https://github.com/j178/prek/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md) than `pre-commit` and uses only a third of disk space.
- It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.
- Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.
- It uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.
- It implements some common hooks in Rust, built in prek, which are faster than their Python counterparts.

### prek provides a better user experience

- No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.
- No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.
- (TODO): Built-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
- `prek run` has some improvements over `pre-commit run`, such as:
    - `prek run --directory &lt;dir&gt;` runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use `git ls-files -- &lt;dir&gt; | xargs pre-commit run --files` anymore.
    - `prek run --last-commit` runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.
- `prek list` command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.
- prek provides shell completions for `prek run &lt;hook_id&gt;` command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.

## Installation

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Standalone installer&lt;/summary&gt;

prek provides a standalone installer script to download and install the tool:

```console
# On Linux and macOS
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.0.24/prek-installer.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.0.24/prek-installer.ps1 | iex&quot;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;PyPI&lt;/summary&gt;

prek is published as Python binary wheel to PyPI, you can install it using `pip`, `uv` (recommended), or `pipx`:

```console
pip install prek

# or

uv tool install prek

# or

pipx install prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Homebrew&lt;/summary&gt;

```console
brew install j178/tap/prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Cargo&lt;/summary&gt;

Build from source using Cargo:

```console
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/j178/prek
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;GitHub Releases&lt;/summary&gt;

prek release artifacts can be downloaded directly from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/j178/prekprek/releases).
&lt;/details&gt;

If installed via the standalone installer, prek can update itself to the latest version:

```console
$ prek self update
```

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the original [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool, and it wouldn&#039;t be possible without the hard work
of the maintainers and contributors of that project.

And a special thanks to the [Astral](https://github.com/astral-sh) team for their remarkable projects, particularly [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
from which I&#039;ve learned a lot on how to write efficient and idiomatic Rust code.

## BAML: Basically a Made-up Language
&lt;h4&gt;

[Homepage](https://www.boundaryml.com/) | [Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com) | [BAML AI Chat](https://www.boundaryml.com/chat) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/BTNBeXGuaS)



&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

BAML is a simple prompting language for building reliable **AI workflows and agents**.

BAML makes prompt engineering easy by turning it into _schema engineering_ -- where you mostly focus on the models of your prompt -- to get more reliable outputs. 
You don&#039;t need to write your whole app in BAML, only the prompts! You can wire-up your LLM Functions in any language of your choice! See our quickstarts for [Python](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/python), [TypeScript](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/typescript), [Ruby](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/ruby) and [Go, and more](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/installation-language/rest-api-other-languages).

BAML comes with all batteries included -- with full typesafety, streaming, retries, wide model support, even when they don&#039;t support native [tool-calling APIs](#enable-reliable-tool-calling-with-any-model-even-when-they-dont-support-it)

**Try BAML**: [Prompt Fiddle](https://www.promptfiddle.com) ‚Ä¢ [Interactive App Examples](https://baml-examples.vercel.app/)


## The core BAML principle: LLM Prompts are functions

The fundamental building block in BAML is a function. Every prompt is a function that takes in parameters and returns a type.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; string
```

Every function additionally defines which models it uses and what its prompt is.

```rust
function ChatAgent(message: Message[], tone: &quot;happy&quot; | &quot;sad&quot;) -&gt; StopTool | ReplyTool {
    client &quot;openai/gpt-4o-mini&quot;

    prompt #&quot;
        Be a {{ tone }} bot.

        {{ ctx.output_format }}

        {% for m in message %}
        {{ _.role(m.role) }}
        {{ m.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    &quot;#
}

class Message {
    role string
    content string
}

class ReplyTool {
  response string
}

class StopTool {
  action &quot;stop&quot; @description(#&quot;
    when it might be a good time to end the conversation
  &quot;#)
}
```

## BAML Functions can be called from any language
Below we call the ChatAgent function we defined in BAML through Python. BAML&#039;s Rust compiler generates a &quot;baml_client&quot; to access and call them.

```python
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Message, StopTool

messages = [Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=&quot;How can I help?&quot;)]

while True:
  print(messages[-1].content)
  user_reply = input()
  messages.append(Message(role=&quot;user&quot;, content=user_reply))
  tool = b.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
  if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
    print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
    break
  else:
    messages.append(Message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;, content=tool.response))
```
You can write any kind of agent or workflow using chained BAML functions. An agent is a while loop that calls a Chat BAML Function with some state.

And if you need to stream, add a couple more lines:
```python
stream = b.stream.ChatAgent(messages, &quot;happy&quot;)
# partial is a Partial type with all Optional fields
for tool in stream:
    if isinstance(tool, StopTool):
      ...
    
final = stream.get_final_response()
```
And get fully type-safe outputs for each chunk in the stream.

## Test prompts 10x faster, right in your IDE
BAML comes with native tooling for VSCode (jetbrains + neovim coming soon). 

**Visualize full prompt (including any multi-modal assets), and the API request**. BAML gives you full transparency and control of the prompt.

![raw-curl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b34db9-80cd-45a7-a356-6b5ab4a9c5b7)

**Using AI is all about iteration speed.**

If testing your pipeline takes 2 minutes, you can only test 10 ideas in 20 minutes.

If you reduce it to 5 seconds, you can test 240 ideas in the same amount of time.
![resume-attempt2-smaller2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc6b8a6-ffed-4cfc-80b8-78bc8a3d66a6)

The playground also allows you to run tests in parallel -- for even faster iteration speeds üöÄ.

No need to login to websites, and no need to manually define json schemas.

## Enable reliable tool-calling with any model
BAML works even when the models don&#039;t support native tool-calling APIs. We created the SAP (schema-aligned parsing) algorithm to support the flexible outputs LLMs can provide, like markdown within a JSON blob or chain-of-thought prior to answering. [Read more about SAP](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing)

With BAML, your structured outputs work in Day-1 of a model release. No need to figure out whether a model supports parallel tool calls, or whether it supports recursive schemas, or `anyOf` or `oneOf` etc.

See it in action with: **[Deepseek-R1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/deepseek-r1-function-calling)** and [OpenAI O1](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/openai-o1).

## Build beautiful streaming UIs
BAML generates a ton of utilities for NextJS, Python (and any language) to make streaming UIs easy.
![recipe-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf82495b-21fc-40bf-ae98-93eef923d620)

BAML&#039;s streaming interfaces are fully type-safe. Check out the [Streaming Docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/baml-basics/streaming), and our [React hooks](https://docs.boundaryml.com/guide/framework-integration/react-next-js/quick-start)

## Fully Open-Source, and offline
- 100% open-source (Apache 2)
- 100% private. AGI will not require an internet connection, neither will BAML
    - No network requests beyond model calls you explicitly set
    - Not stored or used for any training data
- BAML files can be saved locally on your machine and checked into Github for easy diffs.
- Built in Rust. So fast, you can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s there.

## BAML&#039;s Design Philosophy

Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

- **1:** Avoid invention when possible
    - Yes, prompts need versioning ‚Äî we have a great versioning tool: git
    - Yes, you need to save prompts ‚Äî we have a great storage tool: filesystems
- **2:** Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
- **3:** Be fast
- **4:** A first year university student should be able to understand it

## Why a new programming language

We used to write websites like this:

```python
def home():
    return &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;() =&gt; alert(\\\&quot;hello!\\\&quot;)\&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;&quot;
```

And now we do this:

```jsx
function Home() {
  return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prev =&gt; prev + 1)}&gt;
          {count} clicks!
         &lt;/button&gt;
}
```

New syntax can be incredible at expressing new ideas. Plus the idea of maintaining hundreds of f-strings for prompts kind of disgusts us ü§Æ. Strings are bad for maintainable codebases. We prefer structured strings.

The goal of BAML is to give you the expressiveness of English, but the structure of code.

## Conclusion

As models get better, we&#039;ll continue expecting even more out of them. But what will never change is that we&#039;ll want a way to write maintainable code that uses those models. The current way we all just assemble strings is very reminiscent of the early days PHP/HTML soup in web development. We hope some of the ideas we shared today can make a tiny dent in helping us all shape the way we all code tomorrow.

NIH-plug is an API-agnostic audio plugin framework written in Rust, as well as a
small collection of plugins. The idea is to have a stateful yet simple plugin
API that gets rid of as much unnecessary ceremony wherever possible, while also
keeping the amount of magic to minimum and making it easy to experiment with
different approaches to things. See the [current features](#current-features)
section for more information on the project&#039;s current status.

Check out the [documentation](https://nih-plug.robbertvanderhelm.nl/), or use
the [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug-template) to
quickly get started with NIH-plug.

## Plugins

Check each plugin&#039;s readme file for more details on what the plugin actually
does. You can download the development binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS
from the [automated
builds](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)
page. Or if you&#039;re not signed in on GitHub, then you can also find the latest
nightly build
[here](https://nightly.link/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/workflows/build/master). You
may need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) on macOS to be able to use
the plugins.

Scroll down for more information on the underlying plugin framework.

- [**Buffr Glitch**](plugins/buffr_glitch) is the plugin for you if you enjoy
  the sound of a CD player skipping This plugin is essentially a MIDI triggered
  buffer repeat plugin. When you play a note, the plugin will sample the period
  corresponding to that note&#039;s frequency and use that as a single waveform
  cycle. This can end up sounding like an in-tune glitch when used sparingly, or
  like a weird synthesizer when used less subtly.
- [**Crisp**](plugins/crisp) adds a bright crispy top end to any low bass sound.
  Inspired by Polarity&#039;s [Fake Distortion](https://youtu.be/MKfFn4L1zeg) video.
- [**Crossover**](plugins/crossover) is as boring as it sounds. It cleanly
  splits the signal into two to five bands using a variety of algorithms. Those
  bands are then sent to auxiliary outputs so they can be accessed and processed
  individually. Meant as an alternative to Bitwig&#039;s Multiband FX devices but
  with cleaner crossovers and a linear-phase option.
- [**Diopser**](plugins/diopser) is a totally original phase rotation plugin.
  Useful for oomphing up kickdrums and basses, transforming synths into their
  evil phase-y cousin, and making everything sound like a cheap Sci-Fi laser
  beam.
- [**Loudness War Winner**](plugins/loudness_war_winner) does what it says on
  the tin. Have you ever wanted to show off your dominance by winning the
  loudness war? Neither have I. Dissatisfaction guaranteed.
- [**Puberty Simulator**](plugins/puberty_simulator) is that patent pending One
  Weird Plugin that simulates the male voice change during puberty! If it was
  not already obvious from that sentence, this plugin is a joke, but it might
  actually be useful (or at least interesting) in some situations. This plugin
  pitches the signal down an octave, but it also has the side effect of causing
  things to sound like a cracking voice or to make them sound slightly out of
  tune.
- [**Safety Limiter**](plugins/safety_limiter) is a simple tool to prevent ear
  damage. As soon as there is a peak above 0 dBFS or the specified threshold,
  the plugin will cut over to playing SOS in Morse code, gradually fading out
  again when the input returns back to safe levels. Made for personal use during
  plugin development and intense sound design sessions, but maybe you&#039;ll find it
  useful too!
- [**Soft Vacuum**](plugins/soft_vacuum) is a straightforward port of
  Airwindows&#039; [Hard Vacuum](https://www.airwindows.com/hard-vacuum-vst/) plugin
  with parameter smoothing and up to 16x linear-phase oversampling, because I
  liked the distortion and just wished it had oversampling. All credit goes to
  Chris from Airwindows. I just wanted to share this in case anyone else finds
  it useful.
- [**Spectral Compressor**](plugins/spectral_compressor) can squash anything
  into pink noise, apply simultaneous upwards and downwards compressor to
  dynamically match the sidechain signal&#039;s spectrum and morph one sound into
  another, and lots more. Have you ever wondered what a 16384 band OTT would
  sound like? Neither have I.

## Framework

### Current features

- Supports both VST3 and [CLAP](https://github.com/free-audio/clap) by simply
  adding the corresponding `nih_export_&lt;api&gt;!(Foo)` macro to your plugin&#039;s
  library.
- Standalone binaries can be made by calling `nih_export_standalone(Foo)` from
  your `main()` function. Standalones come with a CLI for configuration and full
  JACK audio, MIDI, and transport support.
- Rich declarative parameter system without any boilerplate.
  - Define parameters for your plugin by adding `FloatParam`, `IntParam`,
    `BoolParam`, and `EnumParam&lt;T&gt;` fields to your parameter struct, assign
    stable IDs to them with the `#[id = &quot;foobar&quot;]`, and a `#[derive(Params)]`
    does all of the boring work for you.
  - Parameters can have complex value distributions and the parameter objects
    come with built-in smoothers and callbacks.
  - Use simple enums deriving the `Enum` trait with the `EnumParam&lt;T&gt;` parameter
    type for parameters that allow the user to choose between multiple discrete
    options. That way you can use regular Rust pattern matching when working
    with these values without having to do any conversions yourself.
  - Store additional non-parameter state for your plugin by adding any field
    that can be serialized with [Serde](https://serde.rs/) to your plugin&#039;s
    `Params` object and annotating them with `#[persist = &quot;key&quot;]`.
  - Optional support for state migrations, for handling breaking changes in
    plugin parameters.
  - Group your parameters into logical groups by nesting `Params` objects using
    the `#[nested(group = &quot;...&quot;)]`attribute.
  - The `#[nested]` attribute also enables you to use multiple copies of the
    same parameter, either as regular object fields or through arrays.
  - When needed, you can also provide your own implementation for the `Params`
    trait to enable compile time generated parameters and other bespoke
    functionality.
- Stateful. Behaves mostly like JUCE, just without all of the boilerplate.
- Comes with a simple yet powerful way to asynchronously run background tasks
  from a plugin that&#039;s both type-safe and realtime-safe.
- Does not make any assumptions on how you want to process audio, but does come
  with utilities and adapters to help with common access patterns.
  - Efficiently iterate over an audio buffer either per-sample per-channel,
    per-block per-channel, or even per-block per-sample-per-channel with the
    option to manually index the buffer or get access to a channel slice at any
    time.
  - Easily leverage per-channel SIMD using the SIMD adapters on the buffer and
    block iterators.
  - Comes with bring-your-own-FFT adapters for common (inverse) short-time
    Fourier Transform operations. More to come.
- Optional sample accurate automation support for VST3 and CLAP that can be
  enabled by setting the `Plugin::SAMPLE_ACCURATE_AUTOMATION` constant to
  `true`.
- Optional support for compressing the human readable JSON state files using
  [Zstandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd).
- Comes with adapters for popular Rust GUI frameworks as well as some basic
  widgets for them that integrate with NIH-plug&#039;s parameter system. Currently
  there&#039;s support for [egui](nih_plug_egui), [iced](nih_plug_iced) and
  [VIZIA](nih_plug_vizia).
  - A simple and safe API for state saving and restoring from the editor is
    provided by the framework if you want to do your own internal preset
    management.
- Full support for receiving and outputting both modern polyphonic note
  expression events as well as MIDI CCs, channel pressure, and pitch bend for
  CLAP and VST3.
  - MIDI SysEx is also supported. Plugins can define their own structs or sum
    types to wrap around those messages so they don&#039;t need to interact with raw
    byte buffers in the process function.
- Support for flexible dynamic buffer configurations, including variable numbers
  of input and output ports.
- First-class support several more exotic CLAP features:
  - Both monophonic and polyphonic parameter modulation are supported.
  - Plugins can declaratively define pages of remote controls that DAWs can bind
    to hardware controllers.
- A plugin bundler accessible through the
  `cargo xtask bundle &lt;package&gt; &lt;build_arguments&gt;` command that automatically
  detects which plugin targets your plugin exposes and creates the correct
  plugin bundles for your target operating system and architecture, with
  cross-compilation support. The cargo subcommand can easily be added to [your
  own project](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/tree/master/nih_plug_xtask)
  as an alias or [globally](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/tree/master/cargo_nih_plug)
  as a regular cargo subcommand.
- Tested on Linux and Windows, with limited testing on macOS. Windows support
  has mostly been tested through Wine with
  [yabridge](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge).
- See the [`Plugin`](src/plugin.rs) trait&#039;s documentation for an incomplete list
  of the functionality that has currently not yet been implemented.

### Building

NIH-plug works with the latest stable Rust compiler.

After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), you can compile any of the plugins
in the `plugins` directory in the following way, replacing `gain` with the name
of the plugin:

```shell
cargo xtask bundle gain --release
```

### Plugin formats

NIH-plug can currently export VST3 and
[CLAP](https://github.com/free-audio/clap) plugins. Exporting a specific plugin
format for a plugin is as simple as calling the `nih_export_&lt;format&gt;!(Foo);`
macro. The `cargo xtask bundle` command will detect which plugin formats your
plugin supports and create the appropriate bundles accordingly, even when cross
compiling.

### Example plugins

The best way to get an idea for what the API looks like is to look at the
examples.

- [**gain**](plugins/examples/gain) is a simple smoothed gain plugin that shows
  off a couple other parts of the API, like support for storing arbitrary
  serializable state.
- **gain-gui** is the same plugin as gain, but with a GUI to control the
  parameter and a digital peak meter. Comes in three exciting flavors:
  [egui](plugins/examples/gain_gui_egui),
  [iced](plugins/examples/gain_gui_iced), and
  [VIZIA](plugins/examples/gain_gui_vizia).

  There are also examples for making custom GUIs with
  [OpenGL](plugins/examples/byo_gui_gl), [wgpu](plugins/examples/byo_gui_wgpu),
  and [softbuffer](plugins/examples/byo_gui_softbuffer).

- [**midi_inverter**](plugins/examples/midi_inverter) takes note/MIDI events and
  flips around the note, channel, expression, pressure, and CC values. This
  example demonstrates how to receive and output those events.
- [**poly_mod_synth**](plugins/examples/poly_mod_synth) is a simple polyphonic
  synthesizer with support for polyphonic modulation in supported CLAP hosts.
  This demonstrates how polyphonic modulation can be used in NIH-plug.
- [**sine**](plugins/examples/sine) is a simple test tone generator plugin with
  frequency smoothing that can also make use of MIDI input instead of generating
  a static signal based on the plugin&#039;s parameters.
- [**stft**](plugins/examples/stft) shows off some of NIH-plug&#039;s other optional
  higher level helper features, such as an adapter to process audio with a
  short-term Fourier transform using the overlap-add method, all using the
  compositional `Buffer` interfaces.
- [**sysex**](plugins/examples/sysex) is a simple example of how to send and
  receive SysEx messages by defining custom message types.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Build for web, desktop, and mobile, and more with a single codebase. Zero-config setup, integrated hot-reloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    rsx! {
        h1 { &quot;High-Five counter: {count}&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, &quot;Up high!&quot; }
        button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, &quot;Down low!&quot; }
    }
}
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Unique features:

- Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more)
- [Ergonomic state management](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/release-050) combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte
- Built-in featureful, type-safe, fullstack web framework
- Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Subsecond Rust hot-patching and asset hot-reloading
- And more! [Take a tour of Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/).

## Instant hot-reloading

With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup, styles, and even Rust code and see changes in milliseconds.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Productive, typesafe, fullstack web framework

Directly call your backend from your frontend with our built-in type-safe RPC using [`server_fn`](http://crates.io/crates/server_fn). Supports streaming, suspense, bundle splitting, websockets, and more.

```rust
fn app() -&gt; Element {
  let mut fortune = use_signal(|| &quot;Fetch a fortune!&quot;);
  rsx! {
    h1 { &quot;{fortune}&quot; }
    button {
      onclick: move |_| async move {
        fortune.set(fetch_fortune().await.unwrap());
      }
    }
  }
}

#[server]
async fn fetch_fortune() -&gt; ServerFnResult&lt;String&gt; {
  &quot;Dioxus is super productive!&quot;.to_string()
}
```

## First-party primitive components

Get started quickly with a complete set of primitives modeled after shadcn/ui and Radix-Primitives.

  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/primitive-components.avif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## First-class Android and iOS support

Dioxus is the fastest way to build native mobile apps with Rust. Simply run `dx serve --platform android` and your app is running in an emulator or on device in seconds. Call directly into JNI and Native APIs.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./notes/android_and_ios2.avif&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Bundle for web, desktop, and mobile

Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guides/assets), and more. Build WebApps weighing [less than 50kb](https://github.com/ealmloff/tiny-dioxus/) and desktop/mobile apps less than 5mb.

        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Running the examples

&gt; The examples in the main branch of this repository target the git version of dioxus and the CLI. If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the [0.6 branch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples).

The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;
```

However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli. If you are running the git version of dioxus, you can install the matching version of the CLI with:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked
```

With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You just need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:

```sh
dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features
```

## Dioxus vs other frameworks

We love all frameworks and enjoy watching innovation in the Rust ecosystem. In fact, many of our projects are shared with other frameworks. For example, our flex-box library [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) is used by [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/), [Lapce](https://lapce.dev/), [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced), and many more.

Dioxus places an emphasis on a few key points that make it different from other frameworks:

- **React-like**: we rely on concepts like components, props, and hooks to build UIs, with our state management being closer to Svelte than to SolidJS.
- **HTML and CSS**: we lean completely into HTML and CSS, quirks and all.
- **Renderer-agnostic**: you can swap out the renderer for any platform you want thanks to [our fast VirtualDOM](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/templates-diffing).
- **Collaborative**: whenever possible, we spin out crates like [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy), [manganis](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/manganis), [include_mdbook](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/include_mdbook), and [blitz](http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz) so the ecosystem can grow together.

### Dioxus vs Tauri

Tauri is a framework for building desktop mobile apps where your frontend is written in a web-based framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Whenever you need to do native work, you can write Rust functions and call them from your frontend.

- **Natively Rust**: Tauri&#039;s architecture limits your UI to either JavaScript or WebAssembly. With Dioxus, your Rust code is running natively on the user&#039;s machine, letting you do things like spawning threads, accessing the filesystem, without any IPC bridge. This drastically simplifies your app&#039;s architecture and makes it easier to build. You can build a Tauri app with Dioxus-Web as a frontend if you&#039;d like.

- **Different scopes**: Tauri needs to support JavaScript and its complex build tooling, limiting the scope of what you can do with it. Since Dioxus is exclusively focused on Rust, we&#039;re able to provide extra utilities like Server Functions, advanced bundling, and a native renderer.

- **Shared DNA**: While Tauri and Dioxus are separate projects, they do share libraries like Tao and Wry: windowing and webview libraries maintained by the Tauri team.

### Dioxus vs Leptos

Leptos is a library for building fullstack web-apps, similar to SolidJS and SolidStart. The two libraries share similar goals on the web, but have several key differences:

- **Reactivity model**: Leptos uses signals to drive both reactivity and rendering, while Dioxus uses signals just for reactivity. For managing re-renders, Dioxus uses a highly optimized VirtualDOM to support desktop and mobile architectures. Both Dioxus and Leptos are extremely fast and comparable to the fastest web frameworks.

- **Different scopes**: Dioxus provides renderers for web, desktop, mobile, LiveView, and more. We also maintain community libraries and a cross-platform SDK. Leptos has a tighter focus on the fullstack web with features that Dioxus doesn&#039;t have like islands, `&lt;Form /&gt;` components, and other web-specific utilities.

- **Different DSLs**: Dioxus uses its own custom Rust-like DSL for building UIs while Leptos uses an HTML-like syntax. We chose this to retain compatibility with IDE features like code-folding and syntax highlighting. Generally, Dioxus leans into more &quot;magic&quot; with its DSL including automatic formatting of strings and hot-reloading of simple Rust expressions.

```rust
// dioxus
rsx! {
  div {
    class: &quot;my-class&quot;,
    enabled: true,
    &quot;Hello, {name}&quot;
  }
}

// leptos
view! {
  &lt;div class=&quot;my-class&quot; enabled={true}&gt;
    &quot;Hello &quot;
    {name}
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
```

### Dioxus vs Yew

Yew is a framework for building reactive web apps that initially served as an inspiration for Dioxus. Yew is tightly integrated with the web but has limited utilities for server-side-rendering or alternative rendering engines. Dioxus was built as a redesign of Yew with a focus on cross-platform support, fantastic developer tooling, improved ergonomics, and a complete full-stack web story.

- **Full-stack capabilities**: Yew was initially designed for SPAs and remains deeply integrated with the web platform. Dioxus, in contrast, was built from the ground up for fullstack and cross-platform development, enabling seamless app creation across web, desktop, mobile, and server applications.

- **Developer Tooling**: Dioxus offers a richer set of built-in developer tools, such as autoformatting, hot-reloading, and an integrated bundler, helping streamline the development experience.

- **Ongoing support**: Dioxus is very actively maintained, with new features and bug fixes being fixed on a daily or weekly basis.

### Dioxus vs egui

egui is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powering tools like [Rerun.io](https://www.rerun.io).

- **Immediate vs Retained**: egui is designed to be re-rendered on every frame. This is suitable for games and other interactive applications, but it does not retain style and layout state between frames. Dioxus is a retained UI framework, meaning that the UI is built once and then modified between frames. This enables Dioxus to use native web technologies like HTML and CSS with better battery life and performance.

- **Customizable**: egui brings its own styling and layout solution while Dioxus expects you to use the built-in HTML and CSS. This enables dioxus apps to use any CSS library like Tailwind or Material UI.

- **State management**: egui&#039;s state management is based on a single global state object. Dioxus encourages encapsulation of state by using components and props, making components more reusable.

### Dioxus vs Iced

Iced is a cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm. Iced renders natively with WGPU and supports the web using DOM nodes.

- **Elm state management**: Iced uses Elm&#039;s state management model, which is based on message passing and reducers. This is simply a different state management model than Dioxus and can be rather verbose at times.

- **Native Feel**: Since Dioxus uses a webview as its renderer, it automatically gets native text input, paste handling, and other native features like accessibility. Iced&#039;s renderer currently doesn&#039;t implement these features, making it feel less native.

- **WGPU**: Dioxus&#039; WGPU renderer is currently quite immature and not yet ready for production use. Iced&#039;s WGPU renderer is much more mature and is being used in production. This enables certain types of apps that need GPU access to be built with Iced that can&#039;t currently be built with Dioxus.

### Dioxus vs Electron

Dioxus and Electron are two entirely different projects with similar goals. Electron makes it possible for developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Lightweight**: Dioxus uses the system&#039;s native WebView - or optionally, a WGPU renderer - to render the UI. This makes a typical Dioxus app about 15mb on macOS in comparison to Electron&#039;s 100mb. Electron also ships an embedded chromium instance which cannot share system resources with the host OS in the same way as Dioxus.

- **Maturity**: Electron is a mature project with a large community and a lot of tooling. Dioxus is still quite young in comparison to Electron. Expect to run into features like deep-linking that require extra work to implement.

### Syntax highlighting

`bat` supports syntax highlighting for a large number of programming and markup
languages:

![Syntax highlighting example](https://imgur.com/rGsdnDe.png)

### Git integration

`bat` communicates with `git` to show modifications with respect to the index
(see left side bar):

![Git integration example](https://i.imgur.com/2lSW4RE.png)

### Show non-printable characters

You can use the `-A`/`--show-all` option to show and highlight non-printable
characters:

![Non-printable character example](https://i.imgur.com/WndGp9H.png)

### Automatic paging

By default, `bat` pipes its own output to a pager (e.g. `less`) if the output is too large for one screen.
If you would rather `bat` work like `cat` all the time (never page output), you can set `--paging=never` as an option, either on the command line or in your configuration file.
If you intend to alias `cat` to `bat` in your shell configuration, you can use `alias cat=&#039;bat --paging=never&#039;` to preserve the default behavior.

#### File concatenation

Even with a pager set, you can still use `bat` to concatenate files :wink:.
Whenever `bat` detects a non-interactive terminal (i.e. when you pipe into another process or into a file), `bat` will act as a drop-in replacement for `cat` and fall back to printing the plain file contents, regardless of the `--pager` option&#039;s value.

## How to use

Display a single file on the terminal

```bash
&gt; bat README.md
```

Display multiple files at once

```bash
&gt; bat src/*.rs
```

Read from stdin, determine the syntax automatically (note, highlighting will
only work if the syntax can be determined from the first line of the file,
usually through a shebang such as `#!/bin/sh`)

```bash
&gt; curl -s https://sh.rustup.rs | bat
```

Read from stdin, specify the language explicitly

```bash
&gt; yaml2json .travis.yml | json_pp | bat -l json
```

Show and highlight non-printable characters:
```bash
&gt; bat -A /etc/hosts
```

Use it as a `cat` replacement:

```bash
bat &gt; note.md  # quickly create a new file

bat header.md content.md footer.md &gt; document.md

bat -n main.rs  # show line numbers (only)

bat f - g  # output &#039;f&#039;, then stdin, then &#039;g&#039;.
```

### Integration with other tools

#### `fzf`

You can use `bat` as a previewer for [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). To do this,
use `bat`&#039;s `--color=always` option to force colorized output. You can also use `--line-range`
option to restrict the load times for long files:

```bash
fzf --preview &quot;bat --color=always --style=numbers --line-range=:500 {}&quot;
```

For more information, see [`fzf`&#039;s `README`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#preview-window).

#### `find` or `fd`

You can use the `-exec` option of `find` to preview all search results with `bat`:

```bash
find ‚Ä¶ -exec bat {} +
```

If you happen to use [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), you can use the `-X`/`--exec-batch` option to do the same:

```bash
fd ‚Ä¶ -X bat
```

#### `ripgrep`

With [`batgrep`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batgrep.md), `bat` can be used as the printer for [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search results.

```bash
batgrep needle src/
```

#### `tail -f`

`bat` can be combined with `tail -f` to continuously monitor a given file with syntax highlighting.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/pacman.log | bat --paging=never -l log
```

Note that we have to switch off paging in order for this to work. We have also specified the syntax
explicitly (`-l log`), as it can not be auto-detected in this case.

#### `git`

You can combine `bat` with `git show` to view an older version of a given file with proper syntax
highlighting:

```bash
git show v0.6.0:src/main.rs | bat -l rs
```

#### `git diff`

You can combine `bat` with `git diff` to view lines around code changes with proper syntax
highlighting:
```bash
batdiff() {
    git diff --name-only --relative --diff-filter=d -z | xargs -0 bat --diff
}
```
If you prefer to use this as a separate tool, check out `batdiff` in [`bat-extras`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras).

If you are looking for more support for git and diff operations, check out [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).

#### `xclip`

The line numbers and Git modification markers in the output of `bat` can make it hard to copy
the contents of a file. To prevent this, you can call `bat` with the `-p`/`--plain` option or
simply pipe the output into `xclip`:
```bash
bat main.cpp | xclip
```
`bat` will detect that the output is being redirected and print the plain file contents.

#### `man`

`bat` can be used as a colorizing pager for `man`, by setting the
`MANPAGER` environment variable:

```bash
export MANPAGER=&quot;sh -c &#039;awk &#039;\&#039;&#039;{ gsub(/\x1B\[[0-9;]*m/, \&quot;\&quot;, \$0); gsub(/.\x08/, \&quot;\&quot;, \$0); print }&#039;\&#039;&#039; | bat -p -lman&#039;&quot;
man 2 select
```
(replace `bat` with `batcat` if you are on Debian or Ubuntu)

If you prefer to have this bundled in a new command, you can also use [`batman`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/batman.md).

&gt; [!WARNING]  
&gt; This will [not work](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1145) out of the box with Mandoc&#039;s `man` implementation.
&gt;
&gt; Please either use `batman`, or convert the shell script to a [shebang executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) and point `MANPAGER` to that.

Note that the [Manpage syntax](assets/syntaxes/02_Extra/Manpage.sublime-syntax) is developed in this repository and still needs some work.

#### `prettier` / `shfmt` / `rustfmt`

The [`prettybat`](https://github.com/eth-p/bat-extras/blob/master/doc/prettybat.md) script is a wrapper that will format code and print it with `bat`.

#### `Warp`

&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.warp.dev/drive/folder/-Bat-Warp-Pack-lxhe7HrEwgwpG17mvrFSz1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;doc/sponsors/warp-pack-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;Warp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

#### Highlighting `--help` messages

You can use `bat` to colorize help text: `$ cp --help | bat -plhelp`

You can also use a wrapper around this:

```bash
# in your .bashrc/.zshrc/*rc
alias bathelp=&#039;bat --plain --language=help&#039;
help() {
    &quot;$@&quot; --help 2&gt;&amp;1 | bathelp
}
```

Then you can do `$ help cp` or `$ help git commit`.

When you are using `zsh`, you can also use global aliases to override `-h` and `--help` entirely:

```bash
alias -g -- -h=&#039;-h 2&gt;&amp;1 | bat --language=help --style=plain&#039;
alias -g -- --help=&#039;--help 2&gt;&amp;1 | bat --language=help --style=plain&#039;
```

For `fish`, you can use abbreviations:

```fish
abbr -a --position anywhere -- --help &#039;--help | bat -plhelp&#039;
abbr -a --position anywhere -- -h &#039;-h | bat -plhelp&#039;
```

This way, you can keep on using `cp --help`, but get colorized help pages.

Be aware that in some cases, `-h` may not be a shorthand of `--help` (for example with `ls`). In cases where you need to use `-h` 
as a command argument you can prepend `\` to the arguement (eg. `ls \-h`) to escape the aliasing defined above. 

Please report any issues with the help syntax in [this repository](https://github.com/victor-gp/cmd-help-sublime-syntax).


## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/bat-cat.svg?columns=3&amp;exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/bat-cat/versions)

### On Ubuntu (using `apt`)
*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*

`bat` is available on [Ubuntu since 20.04 (&quot;Focal&quot;)](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=bat&amp;exact=1) and [Debian since August 2021 (Debian 11 - &quot;Bullseye&quot;)](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/bat).

If your Ubuntu/Debian installation is new enough you can simply run:

There are a few options to install `bat` on Windows. Once you have installed `bat`,
take a look at the [&quot;Using `bat` on Windows&quot;](#using-bat-on-windows) section.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)

#### With WinGet

You can install `bat` via [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget):

```bash
winget install sharkdp.bat
```

#### With Chocolatey

You can install `bat` via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/Bat):
```bash
choco install bat
```

#### With Scoop

You can install `bat` via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):
```bash
scoop install bat
```

#### From prebuilt binaries:

You can download prebuilt binaries from the [Release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases),

You will need to install the [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) package.

### From binaries

Check out the [Release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/releases) for
prebuilt versions of `bat` for many different architectures. Statically-linked
binaries are also available: look for archives with `musl` in the file name.

### From source

If you want to build `bat` from source, you need Rust 1.74.0 or
higher. You can then use `cargo` to build everything:

#### From local source
```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
```
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The `--path .` above specifies the directory of the source code and NOT where `bat` will be installed.
&gt; For more information see the docs for [`cargo install`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html).

#### From `crates.io`
```bash
cargo install --locked bat
```

Note that additional files like the man page or shell completion
files can not be installed automatically in both these ways.
If installing from a local source, they will be generated by `cargo`
and should be available in the cargo target folder under `build`.

Furthermore, shell completions are also available by running:
```bash
bat --completion &lt;shell&gt;
# see --help for supported shells
```

## Customization

### Highlighting theme

Use `bat --list-themes` to get a list of all available themes for syntax
highlighting. To select the `TwoDark` theme, call `bat` with the
`--theme=TwoDark` option or set the `BAT_THEME` environment variable to
`TwoDark`. Use `export BAT_THEME=&quot;TwoDark&quot;` in your shell&#039;s startup file to
make the change permanent. Alternatively, use `bat`&#039;s
[configuration file](#configuration-file).

If you want to preview the different themes on a custom file, you can use
the following command (you need [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for this):
```bash
bat --list-themes | fzf --preview=&quot;bat --theme={} --color=always /path/to/file&quot;
```

`bat` automatically picks a fitting theme depending on your terminal&#039;s background color.
You can use the `--theme-dark` / `--theme-light` options or the `BAT_THEME_DARK` / `BAT_THEME_LIGHT` environment variables
to customize the themes used. This is especially useful if you frequently switch between dark and light mode.

You can also use a custom theme by following the
[&#039;Adding new themes&#039; section below](#adding-new-themes).

### 8-bit themes

`bat` has three themes that always use [8-bit colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors),
even when truecolor support is available:

- `ansi` looks decent on any terminal. It uses 3-bit colors: black, red, green,
  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
- `base16` is designed for [base16](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home) terminal themes. It uses
  4-bit colors (3-bit colors plus bright variants) in accordance with the
  [base16 styling guidelines](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home/blob/main/styling.md).
- `base16-256` is designed for [tinted-shell](https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-shell).
  It replaces certain bright colors with 8-bit colors from 16 to 21. **Do not** use this simply
  because you have a 256-color terminal but are not using tinted-shell.

Although these themes are more restricted, they have three advantages over truecolor themes. They:

- Enjoy maximum compatibility. Some terminal utilities do not support more than 3-bit colors.
- Adapt to terminal theme changes. Even for already printed output.
- Visually harmonize better with other terminal software.

### Output style

You can use the `--style` option to control the appearance of `bat`&#039;s output.
You can use `--style=numbers,changes`, for example, to show only Git changes
and line numbers but no grid and no file header. Set the `BAT_STYLE` environment
variable to make these changes permanent or use `bat`&#039;s
[configuration file](#configuration-file).

&gt;[!tip]
&gt; If you specify a default style in `bat`&#039;s config file, you can change which components
&gt; are displayed during a single run of `bat` using the `--style` command-line argument.
&gt; By prefixing a component with `+` or `-`, it can be added or removed from the current style.
&gt;
&gt; For example, if your config contains `--style=full,-snip`, you can run bat with
&gt; `--style=-grid,+snip` to remove the grid and add back the `snip` component.
&gt; Or, if you want to override the styles completely, you use `--style=numbers` to
&gt; only show the line numbers.

### Adding new syntaxes / language definitions

Should you find that a particular syntax is not available within `bat`, you can follow these
instructions to easily add new syntaxes to your current `bat` installation.

`bat` uses the excellent [`syntect`](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/)
library for syntax highlighting. `syntect` can read any
[Sublime Text `.sublime-syntax` file](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html)
and theme.

A good resource for finding Sublime Syntax packages is [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Once you found a
syntax:

1. Create a folder with syntax definition files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes&quot;
   cd &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes&quot;

   # Put new &#039;.sublime-syntax&#039; language definition files
   # in this folder (or its subdirectories), for example:
   git clone https://github.com/tellnobody1/sublime-purescript-syntax
   ```

2. Now use the following command to parse these files into a binary cache:

   ```bash
   bat cache --build
   ```

3. Finally, use `bat --list-languages` to check if the new languages are available.

   If you ever want to go back to the default settings, call:

   ```bash
   bat cache --clear
   ```

4. If you think that a specific syntax should be included in `bat` by default, please
   consider opening a &quot;syntax request&quot; ticket after reading the policies and
   instructions [here](doc/assets.md): [Open Syntax Request](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/new?labels=syntax-request&amp;template=syntax_request.md).

### Adding new themes

This works very similar to how we add new syntax definitions.

First, create a folder with the new syntax highlighting themes:
```bash
mkdir -p &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/themes&quot;
cd &quot;$(bat --config-dir)/themes&quot;

# Download a theme in &#039;.tmTheme&#039; format, for example:
git clone https://github.com/greggb/sublime-snazzy

# Update the binary cache
bat cache --build
```

Finally, use `bat --list-themes` to check if the new themes are available.

### Adding or changing file type associations

You can add new (or change existing) file name patterns using the `--map-syntax`
command line option. The option takes an argument of the form `pattern:s
