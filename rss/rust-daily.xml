&lt;/div&gt;

Buck2 is a fast, hermetic, multi-language build system, and a direct successor
to the original [Buck build system](https://buck.build) (&quot;Buck1&quot;) &amp;mdash; both
designed by Meta.

But what do those words really mean for a build system &amp;mdash; and why might
they interest you? &quot;But why Buck2?&quot; you might ask, when so many build systems
already exist?

- **Fast**. It doesn&#039;t matter whether a single build command takes 60 seconds to
  complete, or 0.1 seconds: when you have to build things, Buck2 doesn&#039;t waste
  time &amp;mdash; it calculates the critical path and gets out of the way, with
  minimal overhead. It&#039;s not just the core design, but also careful attention to
  detail that makes Buck2 so snappy. Buck2 is up to 2x faster than Buck1 _in
  practice_[^perf-note]. So you spend more time iterating, and less time
  waiting.
- **Hermetic**. When using Remote Execution[^hermetic-re-only], Buck2 becomes
  _hermetic_: it is required for a build rule to correctly declare all of its
  inputs; if they aren&#039;t specified correctly (e.g. a `.c` file needs a `.h` file
  that isn&#039;t correctly specified), the build will fail. This enforced
  correctness helps avoids entire classes of errors that most build systems
  allow, and helps ensure builds work everywhere for all users. And Buck2
  correctly tracks dependencies with far better accuracy than Buck1, in more
  languages, across more scenarios. That means &quot;it compiles on my machine&quot; can
  become a thing of the past.
- **Multi-language**. Many teams have to deal with multiple programming
  languages that have complex inter-dependencies, and struggle to express that.
  Most people settle with `make` and tie together `dune` to `pip` and `cargo`.
  But then how do you run test suites, code coverage, or query code databases?
  Buck2 is designed to support multiple languages from the start, with
  abstractions for interoperation. And because it&#039;s completely scriptable, and
  _users_ can implement language support &amp;mdash; it&#039;s incredibly flexible. Now
  your Python library can depend on an OCaml library, and your OCaml library can
  depend on a Rust crate &amp;mdash; and with a single build tool, you have a
  consistent UX to build and test and integrate all of these components.

[^perf-note]:
    This number comes from internal usage of Buck1 versus Buck2 at Meta. Please
    note that _appropriate_ comparisons with systems like Bazel have yet to be
    performed; Buck1 is the baseline because it&#039;s simply what existed and what
    had to be replaced. Please benchmark Buck2 against your favorite tools and
    let us know how it goes!

[^hermetic-re-only]:
    Buck2 currently does not sandbox _local-only_ build steps; in contrast,
    Buck2 using Remote Execution is _always_ hermetic by design. The vast
    majority of build rules are remote compatible, as well. Despite that, we
    hope to lift this restriction in the (hopefully short-term) future so that
    local-only builds are hermetic as well.

If you&#039;re familiar with systems like Buck1, [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), or
[Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) &amp;mdash; then Buck2 will feel warm and cozy,
and these ideas will be familiar. But then why create Buck2 if those already
exist? Because that isn&#039;t all &amp;mdash; the page
_[&quot;Why Buck2?&quot;](https://buck2.build/docs/about/why/)_ on our website goes into
more detail on several other important design critera that separate Buck2 from
the rest of the pack, including:

- Support for ultra-large repositories, through filesystem virtualization and
  watching for changes to the filesystem.
- Totally language-agnostic core executable, with a small API &amp;mdash; even C/C++
  support is written as a library. You can write everything from scratch, if you
  wanted.
- &quot;Buck Extension Language&quot; (BXL) can be used for self-introspection of the
  build system, allowing automation tools to inspect and run actions in the
  build graph. This allows you to more cleanly support features that need graph
  introspection, like LSPs or compilation databases.
- Support for distributed compilation, using the same Remote Execution API that
  is supported by Bazel. Existing solutions like BuildBarn, BuildBuddy, EngFlow,
  and NativeLink all work today.
- An efficient, robust, and sound design &amp;mdash; inspired by modern theory of
  build systems and incremental computation.
- And more!

If these headline features make you interested &amp;mdash; check out the
[Getting Started](https://buck2.build/docs/getting_started/) guide!

## 🚧🚧🚧 **Warning** 🚧🚧🚧 &amp;mdash; rough terrain lies ahead

Buck2 currently **does not have a stable release tag at this time**. Pre-release
tags/binaries, and stable tags/binaries, will come at later dates. Despite that,
it is used extensively inside of Meta on vast amounts of code every day, and
[buck2-prelude](/prelude/) is the same code used internally for all these
builds, as well.

Meta just uses the latest committed `HEAD` version of Buck2 at all times. Your
mileage may vary &amp;mdash; but at the moment, tracking `HEAD` is ideal for
submitting bug reports and catching regressions.

The short of this is that you should consider this project and its code to be
battle-tested and working, but outside consumers will encounter quite a lot of
rough edges right now &amp;mdash; several features are missing or in progress, some
toolchains from Buck1 are missing, and you&#039;ll probably have to fiddle with
things more than necessary to get it nice and polished.

Please provide feedback by submitting
[issues and questions!](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/issues)

## Installing Buck2

You can get started by downloading a
[bi-monthly version](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/tags) or the
[latest](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/latest) built binary for
your platform. The `latest` tag always refers to a recent commit; it is updated
on every single push to the GitHub repository, so it will always be a recent
version.

Alternately, you can use [dotslash](https://dotslash-cli.com/) with the
bi-monthly releases where it&#039;s easy to deploy into a repo with a single text
file and auto pull the correct platform as needed.

You can also compile Buck2 from source, if a binary isn&#039;t immediately available
for your use; check out the [HACKING.md](./HACKING.md) file for information.

## Terminology conventions

Frequently used terms and their definitions can be found on the
[glossary page](https://buck2.build/docs/concepts/glossary/).

## License

Buck2 is licensed under both the MIT license and Apache-2.0 license; the exact
terms can be found in the [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) and
[LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) files, respectively.

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful
as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst has:

- Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks
- Flexible functions for everything else
- A tightly integrated scripting system
- Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more
- Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation
- Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong

This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you
need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience,
consider signing up to our [collaborative online editor][app] for free.

## Example
A [gentle introduction][tutorial] to Typst is available in our documentation.
However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here
it is:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;Example&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


Let&#039;s dissect what&#039;s going on:

- We use _set rules_ to configure element properties like the size of pages or
  the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to `auto`, it scales to
  fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you
  need full control, you can also use [show rules][show] to completely redefine
  the appearance of an element.

- We insert a heading with the `= Heading` syntax. One equals sign creates a top
  level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight
  markup like this, see the [syntax] reference for a full list.

- [Mathematical equations][math] are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra
  spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block.
  Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions
  unless put into quotes. This way, we don&#039;t need backslashes for things like
  `floor` and `sqrt`. And `phi.alt` applies the `alt` modifier to the `phi` to
  select a particular symbol variant.

- Now, we get to some [scripting]. To input code into a Typst document, we can
  write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a
  recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the
  results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells
  row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas `$F_1$` to `$F_8$` and then
  the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator (`..`) to both
  because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays&#039; items as individual
  arguments.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Text version of the code example.&lt;/summary&gt;

  ```typst
  #set page(width: 10cm, height: auto)
  #set heading(numbering: &quot;1.&quot;)

  = Fibonacci sequence
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined through the
  recurrence relation $F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)$.
  It can also be expressed in _closed form:_

  $ F_n = round(1 / sqrt(5) phi.alt^n), quad
    phi.alt = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 $

  #let count = 8
  #let nums = range(1, count + 1)
  #let fib(n) = (
    if n &lt;= 2 { 1 }
    else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
  )

  The first #count numbers of the sequence are:

  #align(center, table(
    columns: count,
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; $F_#n$),
    ..nums.map(n =&gt; str(fib(n))),
  ))
  ```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation
Typst&#039;s CLI is available from different sources:

- You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst
  from the [releases page][releases]. Download the archive for your platform and
  place it in a directory that is in your `PATH`. To stay up to date with future
  releases, you can simply run `typst update`.

- You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the
  versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release.
  - Linux:
      - View [Typst on Repology][repology]
      - View [Typst&#039;s Snap][snap]
  - macOS: `brew install typst`
  - Windows: `winget install --id Typst.Typst`

- If you have a [Rust][rust] toolchain installed, you can install
  - the latest released Typst version with
    `cargo install --locked typst-cli`
  - a development version with
    `cargo install --git https://github.com/typst/typst --locked typst-cli`

- Nix users can
  - use the `typst` package with `nix-shell -p typst`
  - build and run a development version with
    `nix run github:typst/typst -- --version`.

- Docker users can run a prebuilt image with
  `docker run ghcr.io/typst/typst:latest --help`.

## Usage
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `file.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile file.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile path/to/source.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch file.typ
```

Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all
of the fonts it discovered:
```sh
# Adds additional directories to search for fonts.
typst compile --font-path path/to/fonts file.typ

# Lists all of the discovered fonts in the system and the given directory.
typst fonts --font-path path/to/fonts

# Or via environment variable (Linux syntax).
TYPST_FONT_PATHS=path/to/fonts typst fonts
```

For other CLI subcommands and options, see below:
```sh
# Prints available subcommands and options.
typst help

# Prints detailed usage of a subcommand.
typst help watch
```

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant
preview, you can also check out [Typst&#039;s free web app][app].

## Community
The main places where the community gathers are our [Forum][forum] and our
[Discord server][discord]. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help
others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more
suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat.
We&#039;d be happy to see you there!

[Typst Universe][universe] is where the community shares templates and packages.
If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our
[package repository][packages].

If you had a bad experience in our community, please [reach out to us][contact].

## Contributing
We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel
free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix,
please follow the steps outlined in the [contribution guide][contributing].

To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the
[latest stable Rust][rust] installed. Then, clone this repository and build the
CLI with the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/typst/typst
cd typst
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be stored in `target/release/`.

Another good way to contribute is by [sharing packages][packages] with the
community.

## Pronunciation and Spelling
IPA: /taɪpst/. &quot;Ty&quot; like in **Ty**pesetting and &quot;pst&quot; like in Hi**pst**er. When
writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital &quot;T&quot;.

## Design Principles
All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power,
simplicity, and performance. We think it&#039;s time for a system that matches the
power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize
instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles:

- **Simplicity through Consistency:**
  If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that
  knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing,
  one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g.
  it&#039;s okay that `= Introduction` and `#heading[Introduction]` do the same thing
  because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter.

- **Power through Composability:**
  There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or
  have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the
  second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we&#039;ve
  never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it&#039;s a bit
  low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don&#039;t really
  have that much composability. Instead, there&#039;s a package for everything
  (`\usepackage{knob}`).

- **Performance through Incrementality:**
  All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation.
  Luckily we have [`comemo`], a system for incremental compilation which does
  most of the hard work in the background.

[Deno](https://deno.com)
([/ˈdiːnoʊ/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88di%CB%90no%CA%8A), pronounced
`dee-no`) is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults and a great developer experience. It&#039;s built on [V8](https://v8.dev/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/).

Learn more about the Deno runtime
[in the documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual).

## Installation

Install the Deno runtime on your system using one of the commands below. Note
that there are a number of ways to install Deno - a comprehensive list of
installation options can be found

### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source).

## Your first Deno program

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to
build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following
TypeScript code:

```ts
Deno.serve((_req: Request) =&gt; {
  return new Response(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
});
```

Run your server with the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts

A rust implementation of [gRPC], a high performance, open source, general
RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first.

[`tonic`] is a gRPC over HTTP/2 implementation focused on high performance, interoperability, and flexibility. This library was created to have first class support of async/await and to act as a core building block for production systems written in Rust.

## Overview

[`tonic`] is composed of three main components: the generic gRPC implementation, the high performance HTTP/2
implementation and the codegen powered by [`prost`]. The generic implementation can support any HTTP/2
implementation and any encoding via a set of generic traits. The HTTP/2 implementation is based on [`hyper`],
a fast HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 client and server built on top of the robust [`tokio`] stack. The codegen
contains the tools to build clients and servers from [`protobuf`] definitions.

## Features

- Bi-directional streaming
- High performance async io
- Interoperability
- TLS backed by [`rustls`]
- Load balancing
- Custom metadata
- Authentication
- Health Checking

## Getting Started

- The [`helloworld`][helloworld-tutorial] tutorial provides a basic example of using `tonic`, perfect for first time users!
- The [`routeguide`][routeguide-tutorial] tutorial provides a complete example of using `tonic` and all its features.

Examples can be found in [`examples`] and for more complex scenarios [`interop`]
may be a good resource as it shows examples of many of the gRPC features.

### Rust Version

`tonic`&#039;s MSRV is `1.75`.

### Dependencies

[`tonic-build`] uses `protoc` [Protocol Buffers compiler] in some APIs which compile Protocol Buffers resource files such as [`tonic_build::compile_protos()`].

[Protocol Buffers compiler]: https://protobuf.dev/downloads/
[`tonic_build::compile_protos()`]: https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/fn.compile_protos.html

## Getting Help

First, see if the answer to your question can be found in the API documentation.
If the answer is not there, there is an active community in
the [Tonic Discord channel][discord]. We would be happy to try to answer your
question. If that doesn&#039;t work, try opening an [issue] with the question.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Mountpoint for Amazon S3

[![Tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Integration tests](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/actions/workflows/integration_main.yml)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a simple, high-throughput file client for [mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/the-inside-story-on-mountpoint-for-amazon-s3-a-high-performance-open-source-file-client/). With Mountpoint for Amazon S3, your applications can access objects stored in Amazon S3 through file operations like `open` and `read`. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 automatically translates these operations into S3 object API calls, giving your applications access to the elastic storage and throughput of Amazon S3 through a file interface.

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is optimized for applications that need high read throughput to large objects, potentially from many clients at once, and to write new objects sequentially from a single client at a time. This means it&#039;s a great fit for applications that use a file interface to:
* read large objects from S3, potentially from many instances concurrently, without downloading them to local storage first
* access only some S3 objects out of a larger data set, but can&#039;t predict which objects in advance
* upload their output to S3 directly, or upload files from local storage with tools like `cp`

but probably not the right fit for applications that:
* use file operations that S3 doesn&#039;t natively support, like directory renaming or symlinks
* make edits to existing files (don&#039;t work on your Git repository or run `vim` in Mountpoint 😄)

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 does not implement all the features of a POSIX file system, and there are some differences that may affect compatibility with your application. See [Mountpoint file system behavior](doc/SEMANTICS.md) for a detailed description of Mountpoint for Amazon S3&#039;s behavior and POSIX support and how they could affect your application.
To troubleshoot file operations that may not be supported by Mountpoint, see the [troubleshooting documentation](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Current status

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is generally available! We&#039;re tracking future feature development on the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/84). We&#039;re always interested in feedback on features, performance, and compatibility. Please send feedback by [opening a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/issues/new/choose) or adding your input to an existing roadmap issue.

### Notices

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Mountpoint for Amazon S3 v1.4.0, released on January 26, 2024, contains an [issue](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/pull/751) that causes intermittent read failures. We recommend that customers using v1.4.0 upgrade to v1.4.1 or later.

## Getting started

Run these two commands to install Mountpoint for Amazon S3 on your Amazon Linux EC2 instance (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.rpm
    sudo yum install -y ./mount-s3.rpm

On Ubuntu, use these commands instead (for Graviton instances, replace `x86_64` with `arm64` in the URL):

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./mount-s3.deb

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Installing Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and other installation options, including the [Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html) for Kubernetes applications, or building from source.

Once you&#039;ve got Mountpoint for Amazon S3 installed, you can mount your Amazon S3 bucket.
You&#039;ll need valid AWS credentials to access your bucket.
Mountpoint will automatically use credentials from [an IAM role associated with your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html),
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables,
or from [several other sources](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#aws-credentials).

To mount your bucket, run this command,
replacing `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of your bucket
and `/path/to/mount` with the directory you want to mount the bucket to:

    mount-s3 amzn-s3-demo-bucket /path/to/mount

Now you can work with your bucket contents as if they were a local file system:

    ls /path/to/mount
    echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; &gt; /path/to/mount/Data.txt
    cat /path/to/mount/Data.txt

When you&#039;re finished accessing your bucket, you can unmount it (you might need `sudo`):

    umount /path/to/mount

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; See [Configuring Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details on how to configure and use Mountpoint.

### Compatibility with other storage services

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is designed for high-performance access to the Amazon S3 service. While it may be functional against other storage services that use S3-like APIs, we aren&#039;t able to provide support for those use cases, and they may inadvertently break when we make changes to better support Amazon S3. We welcome contributions of minor compatibility fixes or performance improvements for these services if the changes can be tested against Amazon S3.

In addition, double-click the title bar to switch to full-screen mode. For Mac users, you can also use the gesture to go to the previous or next page and drag the title bar to move the window.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Before starting

1. **For beginners**: Play with Popular Packages to find out Pake&#039;s capabilities, or try to pack your application with [GitHub Actions](&lt;https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Online-Compilation-(used-by-ordinary-users)&gt;). Don&#039;t hesitate to reach for assistance at [Discussion](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/discussions)!
2. **For developers**: “Command-Line Packaging” supports macOS fully. For Windows/Linux users, it requires some tinkering. [Configure your environment](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) before getting started.
3. **For hackers**: For people who are good at both front-end development and Rust, how about customizing your apps&#039; function more with the following [Customized Development](#development)?

## Command-Line Packaging

![Pake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/static/main/pake/pake.gif)

**Pake provides a command line tool, making the flow of package customization quicker and easier. See [documentation](./bin/README.md) for more information.**

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install -g pake-cli

# Command usage
pake url [OPTIONS]...

# Feel free to play with Pake! It might take a while to prepare the environment the first time you launch Pake.
pake https://weekly.tw93.fun --name Weekly --hide-title-bar

```

If you are new to the command line, you can compile packages online with _GitHub Actions_. See the [Tutorial](&lt;https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Online-Compilation-(used-by-ordinary-users)&gt;) for more information.

## Development

Prepare your environment before starting. Make sure you have Rust `&gt;=1.63` and Node `&gt;=16` (e.g., `16.18.1`) installed on your computer. For installation guidance, see [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

If you are unfamiliar with these, it is better to try out the above tool to pack with one click.

```sh
# Install Dependencies
npm i

# Local development [Right-click to open debug mode.]
npm run dev

# Pack application
npm run build
```

## Advanced Usage

1. You can refer to the [codebase structure](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Description-of-Pake&#039;s-code-structure) before working on Pake, which will help you much in development.
2. Modify the `url` and `productName` fields in the `pake.json` file under the src-tauri directory, the &quot;domain&quot; field in the `tauri.config.json` file needs to be modified synchronously, as well as the `icon` and `identifier` fields in the `tauri.xxx.conf.json` file. You can select an `icon` from the `icons` directory or download one from [macOSicons](https://macosicons.com/#/) to match your product needs.
3. For configurations on window properties, you can modify the `pake.json` file to change the value of `width`, `height`, `fullscreen` (or not), `resizable` (or not) of the `windows` property. To adapt to the immersive header on Mac, change `hideTitleBar` to `true`, look for the `Header` element, and add the `padding-top` property.
4. For advanced usages such as style rewriting, advertisement removal, JS injection, container message communication, and user-defined shortcut keys, see [Advanced Usage of Pake](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Advanced-Usage-of-Pake).

## Developers

Pake&#039;s development can not be without these Hackers. They contributed a lot of capabilities for Pake. Also, welcome to follow them! ❤️

DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate provides libraries and binaries for developers building fast and
feature rich database and analytic systems, customized to particular workloads.
See [use cases] for examples. The following related subprojects target end users:

- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame
  queries.
- [DataFusion Ray](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ray/) provides a distributed version of DataFusion that scales
  out on Ray clusters.
- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on
  DataFusion.

&quot;Out of the box,&quot;
DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],
built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and
a great community.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.
See the [Architecture] section for more details.

## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines

Public methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a
stable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically
deprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].

[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html

## Dependencies and `Cargo.lock`

Following the [guidance] on committing `Cargo.lock` files, this project commits
its `Cargo.lock` file.

CI uses the committed `Cargo.lock` file, and dependencies are updated regularly
using [Dependabot] PRs.

[guidance]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html
[dependabot]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot

`gitoxide` is an implementation of `git` written in Rust for developing future-proof applications which strive for correctness and
performance while providing a pleasant and unsurprising developer experience.

`gitoxide` provides the `gix` and `ein` binaries for use on the command-line to allow experimentation with key features
like `fetch` and `clone`, and to validate the usability and control of the API offered by the [`gix`] crate.

`gitoxide` aspires to be a production-grade server implementation and the `ein` binary aspires to become the default way to interact with git repositories.

## Development Status

The command-line tools as well as the status of each crate is described in
[the crate status document](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md).

For use in applications, look for the [`gix`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix) crate,
which serves as entrypoint to the functionality provided by various lower-level plumbing crates like
[`gix-config`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md#gix-config).

### Feature Discovery

&gt; Can `gix` do what I need it to do?

The above can be hard to answer and this paragraph is here to help with feature discovery.

Look at [`crate-status.md`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/crate-status.md) for a rather exhaustive document that contains
both implemented and planned features.

Further, the [`gix` crate documentation with the `git2` search term](https://docs.rs/gix/latest/gix?search=git2) helps to find all currently
known `git2` equivalent method calls. Please note that this list is definitely not exhaustive yet, but might help if you are coming from `git2`.

What follows is a high-level list of features and those which are planned:

* [x] clone
* [x] fetch
* [ ] blame
* [ ] push
* [ ] reset
* [ ] status
* [x] blob-diff
* [ ] merge
    - [x] blobs
    - [x] trees
    - [ ] commits
* [ ] rebase
* [ ] commit
* [x] worktree checkout and worktree stream
* [x] reading and writing of objects
* [x] reading and writing of refs
* [x] reading and writing of `.git/index`
* [x] reading and writing of git configuration
* [x] pathspecs
* [x] revspecs
* [x] `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

### Crates

Follow linked crate name for detailed status. Please note that all crates follow [semver] as well as the [stability guide].

[semver]: https://semver.org

### Production Grade

* **Stability Tier 1**
  - [gix-lock](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-lock/README.md)

* **Stability Tier 2**
  - [gix-tempfile](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/gix-tempfile/README.md)

### Stabilization Candidates

Crates that seem feature complete and need to see some more use before they can be released as 1.0.

  * [x] Generate and verify large commit graphs
  * [ ] Generate huge pack from a lot of loose objects

### Stability and MSRV

Our [stability guide] helps to judge how much churn can be expected when depending on crates in this workspace.

[stability guide]: https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/STABILITY.md

## Installation

### Download a Binary Release

Using `cargo binstall`, one is able to fetch [binary releases][releases]. You can install it via `cargo install cargo-binstall`, assuming
the [rust toolchain][rustup] is present.

Then install gitoxide with `cargo binstall gitoxide`.

See the [releases section][releases] for manual installation and various alternative builds that are _slimmer_ or _smaller_, depending
on your needs, for _Linux_, _MacOS_ and _Windows_.

[releases]: https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/releases

### Download from Arch Linux repository

For Arch Linux you can download `gitoxide` from `community` repository:

```sh
pacman -S gitoxide
```

### Download from Exherbo Linux Rust repository

For Exherbo Linux you can download `gitoxide` from the [Rust](https://gitlab.exherbo.org/exherbo/rust/-/tree/master/packages/dev-scm/gitoxide) repository:

```sh
cave resolve -x repository/rust
cave resolve -x gitoxide
```

### From Source via Cargo

`cargo` is the Rust package manager which can easily be obtained through [rustup]. With it, you can build your own binary
effortlessly and for your particular CPU for additional performance gains.

The minimum supported Rust version is [documented in the CI configuration](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/main/.github/workflows/msrv.yml#L23),
the latest stable one will work as well.

There are various build configurations, all of them are [documented here](https://docs.rs/crate/gitoxide/latest). The documentation should also be useful
for packagers who need to tune external dependencies.

```sh
# A way to install `gitoxide` with just Rust and a C compiler installed.
# If there are problems with SSL certificates during clones, try to omit `--locked`.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features max-pure

# The default installation, &#039;max&#039;, is the fastest, but also needs `cmake` to build successfully.
# Installing it is platform-dependent.
cargo install gitoxide

# For smaller binaries and even faster build times that are traded for a less fancy CLI implementation,
# use the `lean` feature.
cargo install gitoxide --locked --no-default-features --features lean
```

The following installs the latest unpublished `max` release directly from git:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

#### How to deal with build failures

On some platforms, installation may fail due to lack of tools required by *C* toolchains. This can generally be avoided by installation with:

```sh
cargo install gitoxide --no-default-features --features max-pure
```

What follows is a list of known failures.

- On Fedora, `perl` needs to be installed for `OpenSSL` to build properly. This can be done with the following command (see [issue #592](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/592)):

  ```sh
  dnf install perl
  ```

### Using Docker

Some CI/CD pipelines leverage repository cloning. Below is a copy-paste-able example to build docker images for such workflows.
As no official image exists (at this time), an image must first be built.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The dockerfile isn&#039;t continuously tested as it costs too much time and thus might already be broken.
&gt; PRs are welcome.

#### Building the most compatible base image

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress . --target=pipeline
```

#### Basic usage in a Pipeline

For example, if a `Dockerfile` currently uses something like `RUN git clone https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide`, first build the image:

```sh
docker build -f etc/docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t gitoxide:latest --compress .
```

Then copy the binaries into your image and replace the `git` directive with a `gix` equivalent.

```dockerfile
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/gix /usr/local/bin/
COPY --from gitoxide:latest /bin/ein /usr/local/bin/

RUN /usr/local/bin/gix clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide gitoxide
```

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs

## Usage

Once installed, there are two binaries:

* **ein**
  * high level commands, _porcelain_, for every-day use, optimized for a pleasant user experience
* **gix**
  * low level commands, _plumbing_, for use in more specialized cases and to validate newly written code in real-world scenarios

## Project Goals

Project goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **a pure-rust implementation of git**
   * including *transport*, *object database*, *references*, *cli* and *tui*
   * a simple command-line interface is provided for the most common git operations, optimized for
     user experience. A *simple-git* if you so will.
   * be the go-to implementation for anyone who wants to solve problems around git, and become
     *the* alternative to `GitPython` and *libgit2* in the process.
   * become the foundation for a distributed alternative to GitHub, and maybe even for use within GitHub itself
 * **learn from the best to write the best possible idiomatic Rust**
   * *libgit2* is a fantastic resource to see what abstractions work, we will use them
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to make misuse impossible
 * **be the best performing implementation**
   * use Rust&#039;s type system to optimize for work not done without being hard to use
   * make use of parallelism from the get go
   * _sparse checkout_ support from day one
 * **assure on-disk consistency**
   * assure reads never interfere with concurrent writes
   * assure multiple concurrent writes don&#039;t cause trouble
 * **take shortcuts, but not in quality**
   * binaries may use `anyhow::Error` exhaustively, knowing these errors are solely user-facing.
   * libraries use light-weight custom errors implemented using `quick-error` or `thiserror`.
   * internationalization is nothing we are concerned with right now.
   * IO errors due to insufficient amount of open file handles don&#039;t always lead to operation failure
 * **Cross platform support, including Windows**
   * With the tools and experience available here there is no reason not to support Windows.
   * [Windows is tested on CI](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/df66d74aa2a8cb62d8a03383135f08c8e8c579a8/.github/workflows/rust.yml#L34)
     and failures do prevent releases.

## Non-Goals

Project non-goals can change over time as we learn more, and they can be challenged.

 * **replicate `git` command functionality perfectly**
   * `git` is `git`, and there is no reason to not use it. Our path is the one of simplicity to make
     getting started with git easy.
 * **be incompatible to git**
   * the on-disk format must remain compatible, and we will never contend with it.
 * **use async IO everywhere**
   * for the most part, git operations are heavily reliant on memory mapped IO as well as CPU to decompress data,
     which doesn&#039;t lend itself well to async IO out of the box.
   * Use `blocking` as well as `gix-features::interrupt` to bring operations into the async world and to control
     long running operations.
   * When connecting or streaming over TCP connections, especially when receiving on the server, async seems like a must
     though, but behind a feature flag.

## Roadmap

### Features for 1.0

Provide a CLI to for the most basic user journey:

* [x] initialize a repository
* [x] fetch
    * [ ] and update worktree
* clone a repository
   - [ ] bare
   - [ ] with working tree
* [ ] create a commit after adding worktree files
* [x] add a remote
* [ ] push
  * [x] create (thin) pack

### Ideas for Examples

* [ ] `gix tool open-remote` open the URL of the remote, possibly after applying known transformations to go from `ssh` to `https`.
* [ ] `tix` as example implementation of `tig`, displaying a version of the commit graph, useful for practicing how highly responsive GUIs can be made.
* [ ] Something like [`git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer), but leveraging extreme decompression speeds of indexed packs.
* [ ] Open up SQL for git using [sqlite virtual tables](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/blob/master/tests/vtab.rs). Check out gitqlite
  as well. What would an MVP look like? Maybe even something that could ship with gitoxide. See [this go implementation as example](https://github.com

## Yazi - ⚡️ Blazing Fast Terminal File Manager

Yazi (means &quot;duck&quot;) is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.

💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)

- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.
- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.
- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.
- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.
- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide
- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths
- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)
- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)
- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52
- ... and more!

## ⚓ Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is creating a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oxc is building a parser, linter, formatter, transformer, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

See more at [oxc.rs](https://oxc.rs)!

## VoidZero Inc.

Oxc is a project of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/), see our announcement [Announcing VoidZero - Next Generation Toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/blog).

If you have requirements for JavaScript tools at scale, please [get in touch](https://forms.gle/WQgjyzYJpwurpxWKA)!

## 🙋Who&#039;s using Oxc?

- [Rolldown] uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing and transformation.
- [Nova engine](https://trynova.dev) uses the [oxc][docs-oxc-url] crate for parsing.
- [Rolldown][rolldown], [Biome][biome] and [swc-node](https://github.com/swc-project/swc-node) uses the [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] crate for module resolution.
- Projects and companies like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/4c20c23c16dd60f380ce9fe98afc93041a7e1562/oxlint.json), [Shopify](https://oxc.rs/blog/2023-12-12-announcing-oxlint.html#_50-100-times-faster-than-eslint), ByteDance and Shopee uses oxlint for linting.
- ...[and many more](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/projects.html)

## ⚡️ Linter Quick Start

The linter is ready to catch mistakes for you. It comes with 93 rules turned on by default (out of 430+ in total) and no configuration is required.

To get started, run [oxlint][npm-oxlint] or via `npx`:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

To give you an idea of its capabilities, here is an example from the [vscode] repository, which finishes linting 4800+ files in 0.7 seconds.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oxc-project/oxc-assets/linter-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## ⚡️ Performance

- The parser aims to be the fastest Rust-based ready-for-production parser.
- The linter is more than 50 times faster than [ESLint], and scales with the number of CPU cores.

&lt;/p&gt;

## ⌨️ Rust, Node.js and Wasm Usage

### Rust

Individual crates are published, you may use them to build your own JavaScript tools.

- The umbrella crate [oxc][docs-oxc-url] exports all public crates from this repository.
- The AST and parser crates [oxc_ast][docs-ast-url] and [oxc_parser][docs-parser-url] are production ready.
- The resolver crate [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url] for module resolution is also production ready.
- Example usages of these crates can be found in their respective `crates/*/examples` directory.

While Rust has gained a reputation for its comparatively slower compilation speed,
we have dedicated significant effort to fine-tune the Rust compilation speed.
Our aim is to minimize any impact on your development workflow,
ensuring that developing your own Oxc based tools remains a smooth and efficient experience.

This is demonstrated by our [CI runs](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain),
where warm runs complete in 3 minutes.

### Node.js

- via napi: [oxc-parser][npm-napi-parser], [oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform]

### Wasm

- [@oxc-parser/wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxc-parser/wasm)

---

## 🎯 Tools

- [AST and Parser](#-ast-and-parser)
- [Linter](#-linter)
- [Resolver](#-resolver)
- [Minifier](#-minifier)
- [Formatter](#-formatter)
- [Transformer](#-transformer)

### 🔸 AST and Parser

Oxc maintains its own AST and parser, which is by far the fastest and most conformant JavaScript and TypeScript (including JSX and TSX) parser written in Rust.

As the parser often represents a key performance bottleneck in JavaScript tooling,
any minor improvements can have a cascading effect on our downstream tools.
By developing our parser, we have the opportunity to explore and implement well-researched performance techniques.

While many existing JavaScript tools rely on [estree] as their AST specification,
a notable drawback is its abundance of ambiguous nodes.
This ambiguity often leads to confusion during development with [estree].

The Oxc AST differs slightly from the [estree] AST by removing ambiguous nodes and introducing distinct types.
For example, instead of using a generic [estree] `Identifier`,
the Oxc AST provides specific types such as `BindingIdentifier`, `IdentifierReference`, and `IdentifierName`.
This clear distinction greatly enhances the development experience by aligning more closely with the ECMAScript specification.

#### 🏆 Parser Performance

Our [benchmark][parser-benchmark] reveals that the Oxc parser surpasses the speed of the [swc] parser by approximately 3 times and the [Biome][biome] parser by 5 times.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST is allocated in a memory arena (&lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/bumpalo&quot;&gt;bumpalo&lt;/a&gt;) for fast AST memory allocation and deallocation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Short strings are inlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/compact_str&quot;&gt;CompactString&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No other heap allocations are done except the above two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scope binding, symbol resolution and some syntax errors are not done in the parser, they are delegated to the semantic analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Linter

The linter embraces convention over configuration, eliminating the need for extensive configuration and plugin setup.
Unlike other linters like [ESLint], which often require intricate configurations and plugin installations (e.g. [@typescript-eslint]),
our linter only requires a single command that you can immediately run on your codebase:

```bash
npx oxlint@latest
```

#### 🏆 Linter Performance

The linter is 50 - 100 times faster than [ESLint] depending on the number of rules and number of CPU cores used.
It completes in less than a second for most codebases with a few hundred files and completes in a few seconds for
larger monorepos. See [bench-javascript-linter](https://github.com/Boshen/bench-javascript-linter) for details.

As an upside, the binary is approximately 5MB, whereas [ESLint] and its associated plugin dependencies can easily exceed 100.

You may also download the linter binary from the [latest release tag](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest) as a standalone binary,
this lets you run the linter without a Node.js installation in your CI.

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oxc parser is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;AST visit is a fast operation due to linear memory scan from the memory arena.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Files are linted in a multi-threaded environment, so scales with the total number of CPU cores.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Every single lint rule is tuned for performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

### 🔸 Resolver

Module resolution plays a crucial role in JavaScript tooling, especially for tasks like multi-file analysis or bundling. However, it can often become a performance bottleneck.
To address this, we developed [oxc_resolver][docs-resolver-url].

The resolver is production-ready and is currently being used in [Rolldown][rolldown]. Usage and examples can be found in its own [repository](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc_resolver).

### 🔸 Transformer

A transformer is responsible for turning higher versions of ECMAScript to a lower version that can be used in older browsers.

TypeScript and React transforms are complete. See [Milestone 2](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/2859) for current goals.

[oxc-transform][npm-napi-transform] can be used for experimentation.

### 🔸 Isolated Declarations

[TypeScript Isolated Declarations Emit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/#isolated-declarations) without using the TypeScript compiler.

Our [benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-transformer) indicates that our implementation is at least 20 times faster than the TypeScript compiler.

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) or [crate](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_isolated_declarations) can be used for this task.

### 🔸 Minifier

JavaScript minification plays a crucial role in optimizing website performance as it reduces the amount of data sent to users,
resulting in faster page loads.
This holds tremendous economic value, particularly for e-commerce websites, where every second can equate to millions of dollars.

However, existing minifiers typically require a trade-off between compression quality and speed.
You have to choose between the slowest for the best compression or the fastest for less compression.
But what if we could develop a faster minifier without compromising on compression?

We are actively working on a prototype that aims to achieve this goal,
by porting all test cases from well-known minifiers such as [google-closure-compiler], [terser], [esbuild], and [tdewolff-minify].

Preliminary results indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives.
With the Oxc minifier, you can expect faster minification times without sacrificing compression quality.

### 🔸 Formatter

While [prettier] has established itself as the de facto code formatter for JavaScript, there is a significant demand in the developer community for a less opinionated alternative. Recognizing this need, our ambition is to undertake research and development to create a new JavaScript formatter that offers increased flexibility and customization options.

The [prototype](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/tree/main/crates/oxc_formatter) is currently work in progress.

## 🧪Test Infrastructure

In Oxc, correctness and reliability are taken extremely seriously.

We spend half of our time on strengthening the test infrastructure to prevent problems from propagating to downstream tools.

[Test Infrastructure](https://oxc.rs/docs/learn/architecture/test.html) documents our test procedures:

- Conformance suite on Test262, Babel, TypeScript
- Lots of fuzzing
- Linter snapshot diagnostics
- oxlint ecosystem ci
- Idempotency testing
- Code coverage
- End to end 3000 top npm packages

## What is Vector?

Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent &amp; aggregator) observability data
pipeline that puts you in control of your observability data.
[Collect][docs.sources], [transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks]
all your logs and metrics to any vendors you want today and any other
vendors you may want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel
data enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x
faster than every alternative in the space.

To get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install
Vector**][docs.installation].

### Principles

* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector&#039;s primary design goal is reliability.
* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.
* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.

### Use cases

* Reduce total observability costs.
* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.
* Enhance data quality and improve insights.
* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.
* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.

### Community

* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,
  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,
  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,
  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].
* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.
* Vector&#039;s largest user **processes over 30TB daily**.
* Vector has **over 100 contributors** and growing.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Nova - Your favorite javascript and wasm engine

## :warning: This project is a Work In Progress, and is very far from being suitable for use :warning:

Nova is a [JavaScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262) (and eventually
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org)) engine written in Rust.

The engine is exposed as a library with an API for implementation in Rust
projects which themselves must serve as a runtime for JavaScript code. The
execution model is currently greatly inspired by
[Kiesel](https://codeberg.org/kiesel-js/kiesel) and
[SerenityOS&#039;s LibJS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity). See the code for
more details.

The project&#039;s website can be found at [trynova.dev](https://trynova.dev/), where
we blog about the project&#039;s progress, and where we track our Test262 pass rate.
The core of our team is on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bwY4TRB8J7).

## Talks

### [Abusing reborrowing for fun, profit, and a safepoint garbage collector @ FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4394-abusing-reborrowing-for-fun-profit-and-a-safepoint-garbage-collector/)

Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/aapoalas/abusing-reborrowing)

Presented at FOSDEM, 2025. Focuses on the technical challenges and solutions
that lead to Nova&#039;s safepoint garbage collector design. The final design mildly
abuses Rust&#039;s &quot;reborrowing&quot; functionality to make the borrow checker not only
understand Nova&#039;s garbage collector but cooperate with making sure it is used in
the correct way.

### [Nova Engine - Building a DOD JS Engine in Rust @ Finland Rust-lang meetup 1/2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKGo1k47eYQ)

Slides:
[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PRinuW2Zbw9c-FGArON3YHiCUP22qIeTpYvDRNbP5vc/edit?usp=drive_link)

Presented at the Finland Rust-lang group&#039;s January meetup, 2024. Focus on how
JavaScript engines work in general, and what sort of design choices Nova makes
in this context.

### [Nova JavaScript Engine - Exploring a Data-Oriented Engine Design @ Web Engines Hackfest 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5olgPdqKZ84)

Slides:
[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YlHr67ZYCyMp_6uMMvCWOJNOUhleUtxOPlC0Gz8Bg7o/edit?usp=drive_link)

Presented at the Web Engines Hackfest, 2024. Focus on the details of why a
data-oriented engine design is interesting, what sort of benefits it gives and
what sort of costs it has. Explores the engine at a slightly deeper level.

The talk was revisited at the TC39 June meeting, 2024. No video is available,
but the slightly modified slides are.

## [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

The architecture and structure of the engine follows the ECMAScript
specification in spirit, but uses data-oriented design for the actual
implementation. Records that are present in the specification are generally
found as a `struct` in Nova in an &quot;equivalent&quot; file / folder path as the
specification defines them in. But instead of referring to these records by
pointer or reference, the engine usually calls these structs the &quot;RecordData&quot; or
&quot;RecordHeapData&quot;, and defines a separate &quot;index&quot; type which takes the &quot;Record&quot;
name and only contains a 32-bit unsigned integer. The heap data struct is stored
inside the engine heap in a vector of these heap data structs, and the index
type stores the correct vector index for the value. Polymorphic index types,
such as the main JavaScript Value, are represented as tagged enums over the
index types.

In general, all specification abstract operations are then written to operate on
the index types instead of operating on the heap structs themselves. This avoids
issues with re-entrancy, pointer aliasing, and others.

### Heap structure - Data-oriented design

Reading the above, you might be wondering why the split into index and heap data
structs is done. The ultimate reason is two-fold:

1. It is an interesting design.
2. It helps the computer make frequently used things fast while allowing the
   infrequently used things to become slow.

Data-oriented design is all the rage on the Internet because of its
cache-friendliness. This engine is one more attempt at seeing what sort of
real-world benefits one might gain with this sort of architecture.

If you find yourself interested in where the idea spawns from and why, take a
look at [the Heap README.md](./nova_vm/src/heap/README.md). It gives a more
thorough walkthrough of the Heap structure and what the idea there is.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you&#039;ve created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate&#039;s Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license&#039;s requirements. If you&#039;re unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you&#039;ve verified that this system is acceptable add the license&#039;s SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

SurrealDB is available as a [hosted platform](https://surrealist.app/cloud). Forget about infrastructure operations, monitoring, backups or capacity planning. [Surreal Cloud](https://surrealdb.com/cloud) allows you to focus on building great products using the power and flexibility of SurrealDB in just a few clicks. Grow from prototype to enterprise-scale. The Surreal Cloud scalable architecture allows your database to evolve as your application grows, ensuring you are always ahead of demand. However if you want to deploy SurrealDB yourself, keep reading below.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/installation.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

SurrealDB is designed to be simple to install and simple to run - using just one command from your terminal. In addition to traditional installation, SurrealDB can be installed and run with HomeBrew, Docker, or using any other container orchestration tool such as Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Rancher, or in Kubernetes.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/apple.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on macOS&lt;/h4&gt;

The quickest way to get going with SurrealDB on macOS is to use Homebrew. This will install both the command-line tools, and the SurrealDB server as a single executable. If you don&#039;t use Homebrew, follow the instructions for Linux below to install SurrealDB.

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
brew install surrealdb/tap/surreal-nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/linux.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Linux&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Unix operating systems is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

If you want to run a beta release, before the next version is released, the `beta` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --beta
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```bash
curl --proto &#039;=https&#039; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh -s -- --nightly
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/windows.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Install on Windows&lt;/h4&gt;

The easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB on Windows is to install and use the SurrealDB command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```ps1
iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex
```

If you want to test a version with the latest features, published every night, install the `nightly` version:

```ps1
iex &quot;&amp; { $(irm https://windows.surrealdb.com) } -Nightly&quot;
```

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://surrealdb.com/install&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/docker.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Run using Docker&lt;/h4&gt;

Docker can be used to manage and run SurrealDB database instances without the need to install any command-line tools. The SurrealDB docker container contains the full command-line tools for importing and exporting data from a running server, or for running a server itself.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start
```

For just getting started with a development server running in memory, you can pass the container a basic initialization to set the user and password as root and enable logging.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always --name surrealdb -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --log info --user root --pass root memory
``` 

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;./img/features.svg&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Quick look&lt;/h2&gt;

With strongly-typed data types, data can be fully modelled right in the database.

```sql
UPDATE person SET
    waist = &lt;int&gt; &quot;34&quot;,
    height = &lt;float&gt; 201,
    score = &lt;decimal&gt; 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1
;
```

Store dynamically computed fields which are calculated when retrieved.

```sql
CREATE person SET
    birthday = &lt;datetime&gt; &quot;2007-06-22&quot;,
    can_drive = &lt;future&gt; { time::now() &gt; birthday + 18y }
;
```

Easily work with unstructured or structured data, in schema-less or schema-full mode.

```sql
-- Create a schemafull table
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Specify fields on the user table
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE object;
DEFINE FIELD name.first ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD name.last ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string ASSERT string::is::email($value);

-- Add a unique index on the email field preventing duplicate values
DEFINE INDEX email ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- Create a new event whenever a user changes their email address
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
    CREATE event SET user = $value, time = time::now(), value = $after.email, action = &#039;email_changed&#039;
);
```

Connect records together with fully directed graph edge connections.

```sql
-- Add a graph edge between user:tobie and article:surreal
RELATE user:tobie-&gt;write-&gt;article:surreal
    SET time.written = time::now()
;

-- Add a graph edge between specific users and developers
LET $from = (SELECT users FROM company:surrealdb);
LET $devs = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE tags CONTAINS &#039;developer&#039;);
RELATE $from-&gt;like-&gt;$devs UNIQUE
    SET time.connected = time::now()
;
```

Query data flexibly with advanced expressions and graph queries.

```sql
-- Select a nested array, and filter based on an attribute
SELECT emails[WHERE active = true] FROM person;

-- Select all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level people who this specific person record knows, or likes, as separate outputs
SELECT -&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f1)-&gt;knows-&gt;(? AS f2)-&gt;(knows, likes AS e3 WHERE influencer = true)-&gt;(? AS f3) FROM person:tobie;

-- Select all person records (and their recipients), who have sent more than 5 emails
SELECT *, -&gt;sent-&gt;email-&gt;to-&gt;person FROM person WHERE count(-&gt;sent-&gt;email) &gt; 5;

-- Select other products purchased by people who purchased this laptop
SELECT &lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;purchased-&gt;product FROM product:laptop;

-- Select products purchased by people in the last 3 weeks who have purchased the same products that we purchased
SELECT -&gt;purchased-&gt;product&lt;-purchased&lt;-person-&gt;(purchased WHERE created_at &gt; time::now() - 3w)-&gt;product FROM person:tobie;
```

Store GeoJSON geographical data types, including points, lines and polygons.

```sql
UPDATE city:london SET
    centre = (-0.118092, 51.509865),
    boundary = {
        type: &quot;Polygon&quot;,
        coordinates: [[
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386], [0.1785278, 51.37692386],
            [0.1785278, 51.61460570], [-0.38314819, 51.61460570],
            [-0.38314819, 51.37692386]
        ]]
    }
;
```

Write custom embedded logic using JavaScript functions.

```sql
CREATE film SET
    ratings = [
        { rating: 6, user: user:bt8e39uh1ouhfm8ko8s0 },
        { rating: 8, user: user:bsilfhu88j04rgs0ga70 },
    ],
    featured = function() {
        return this.ratings.filter(r =&gt; {
            return r.rating &gt;= 7;
        }).map(r =&gt; {
            return { ...r, rating: r.rating * 10 };
        });
    }
;
```

Specify granular access permissions for client and application access.

```sql
-- Specify access permissions for the &#039;post&#039; table
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS
    PERMISSIONS
        FOR select
            -- Published posts can be selected
            WHERE published = true
            -- A user can select all their own posts
            OR user = $auth.id
        FOR create, update
            -- A user can create or update their own posts
            WHERE user = $auth.id
        FOR delete
            -- A user can delete their own posts
            WHERE user = $auth.id
            -- Or an admin can delete any posts
            OR $auth.admin = true
;
```

![Pingora banner image](./docs/assets/pingora_banner.png)

## What is Pingora
Pingora is a Rust framework to [build fast, reliable and programmable networked systems](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source).

Pingora is battle tested as it has been serving more than 40 million Internet requests per second for [more than a few years](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet).

## Feature highlights
* Async Rust: fast and reliable
* HTTP 1/2 end to end proxy
* TLS over OpenSSL, BoringSSL or rustls(experimental).
* gRPC and websocket proxying
* Graceful reload
* Customizable load balancing and failover strategies
* Support for a variety of observability tools

## Reasons to use Pingora
* **Security** is your top priority: Pingora is a more memory safe alternative for services that are written in C/C++
* Your service is **performance-sensitive**: Pingora is fast and efficient
* Your service requires extensive **customization**: The APIs Pingora proxy framework provides are highly programmable

# Getting started

See our [quick starting guide](./docs/quick_start.md) to see how easy it is to build a load balancer.

Our [user guide](./docs/user_guide/index.md) covers more topics such as how to configure and run Pingora servers, as well as how to build custom HTTP servers and proxy logic on top of Pingora&#039;s framework.

API docs are also available for all the crates.

# Notable crates in this workspace
* Pingora: the &quot;public facing&quot; crate to build networked systems and proxies
* Pingora-core: this crate defines the protocols, functionalities and basic traits
* Pingora-proxy: the logic and APIs to build HTTP proxies
* Pingora-error: the common error type used across Pingora crates
* Pingora-http: the HTTP header definitions and APIs
* Pingora-openssl &amp; pingora-boringssl: SSL related extensions and APIs
* Pingora-ketama: the [Ketama](https://github.com/RJ/ketama) consistent algorithm
* Pingora-limits: efficient counting algorithms
* Pingora-load-balancing: load balancing algorithm extensions for pingora-proxy
* Pingora-memory-cache: Async in-memory caching with cache lock to prevent cache stampede
* Pingora-timeout: A more efficient async timer system
* TinyUfo: The caching algorithm behind pingora-memory-cache

Note that Pingora proxy integration with caching should be considered experimental, and as such APIs related to caching are currently highly volatile.

# System requirements

## Systems
Linux is our tier 1 environment and main focus.

We will try our best for most code to compile for Unix environments. This is for developers and users to have an easier time developing with Pingora in Unix-like environments like macOS (though some features might be missing)

Windows support is preliminary by community&#039;s best effort only.

Both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures will be supported.

## Rust version

Pingora keeps a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) policy of 6 months. This means we will accept PRs that upgrade the MSRV as long as the new Rust version used is at least 6 months old.

Our current MSRV is effectively 1.82.

Previously Pingora advertised an MSRV of 1.72. Older Rust versions may still be able to compile via `cargo update` pinning dependencies such as `backtrace@0.3.74`. The advertised MSRV in config files will be officially bumped to 1.82 in an upcoming release.

Building with the optional feature `boringssl` with Boring &gt;= 4.14 requires Rust 1.80.

## Build Requirements

Some of the crates in this repository have dependencies on additional tools and
libraries that must be satisfied in order to build them:

* Make sure that [Clang] is installed on your system (for boringssl)
* Make sure that [Perl 5] is installed on your system (for openssl)

[Clang]:https://clang.llvm.org/
[Perl 5]:https://www.perl.org/

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Bottlerocket OS

Welcome to Bottlerocket!

Bottlerocket is a free and open-source Linux-based operating system meant for hosting containers.

To learn more about Bottlerocket, visit the [official Bottlerocket website and documentation](https://bottlerocket.dev/).
Otherwise, if you’re ready to jump right in, read one of our setup guides for running Bottlerocket in [Amazon EKS](QUICKSTART-EKS.md), [Amazon ECS](QUICKSTART-ECS.md), or [VMware](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).
If you&#039;re interested in running Bottlerocket on bare metal servers, please refer to the [provisioning guide](PROVISIONING-METAL.md) to get started.

Bottlerocket focuses on security and maintainability, providing a reliable, consistent, and safe platform for container-based workloads.
This is a reflection of what we&#039;ve learned building operating systems and services at Amazon.
You can read more about what drives us in [our charter](CHARTER.md).

The base operating system has just what you need to run containers reliably, and is built with standard open-source components.
Bottlerocket-specific additions focus on reliable updates and on the API.
Instead of making configuration changes manually, you can change settings with an API call, and these changes are automatically migrated through updates.

Some notable features include:

* [API access](#api) for configuring your system, with secure out-of-band [access methods](#exploration) when you need them.
* [Updates](#updates) based on partition flips, for fast and reliable system updates.
* [Modeled configuration](#settings) that&#039;s automatically migrated through updates.
* [Security](#security) as a top priority.

## Participate in the Community

There are many ways to take part in the Bottlerocket community:

- [Join us on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bottlerocket-community/) to hear about the latest Bottlerocket (virtual/in-person) events and community meetings.
  Community meetings are typically every other week.

  Details can be found under the [Events section on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bottlerocket-community/events/), and you will receive email notifications if you become a member of the Meetup group. (It&#039;s free to join!)

- [Start or join a discussion](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/discussions) if you have questions about Bottlerocket.

  Please see our [contributor&#039;s guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contact us

If you find a security issue, please [contact our security team](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/security/policy) rather than opening an issue.

We use GitHub issues to track other bug reports and feature requests.
You can look at [existing issues](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues) to see whether your concern is already known.

If not, you can select from a few templates and get some guidance on the type of information that would be most helpful.
[Contact us with a new issue here.](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues/new/choose)

We don&#039;t have other communication channels set up quite yet, but don&#039;t worry about making an issue or a discussion thread!
You can let us know about things that seem difficult, or even ways you might like to help.

## Variants

To start, we&#039;re focusing on the use of Bottlerocket as a host OS in AWS EKS Kubernetes clusters and Amazon ECS clusters.
We’re excited to get early feedback and to continue working on more use cases!

Bottlerocket is architected such that different cloud environments and container orchestrators can be supported in the future.
A build of Bottlerocket that supports different features or integration characteristics is known as a &#039;variant&#039;.
The artifacts of a build will include the architecture and variant name.
For example, an `x86_64` build of the `aws-k8s-1.32` variant will produce an image named `bottlerocket-aws-k8s-1.32-x86_64-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;commit&gt;.img`.

The following variants support EKS, as described above:

* `aws-k8s-1.26`
* `aws-k8s-1.27`
* `aws-k8s-1.28`
* `aws-k8s-1.29`
* `aws-k8s-1.30`
* `aws-k8s-1.31`
* `aws-k8s-1.32`
* `aws-k8s-1.33`
* `aws-k8s-1.26-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.27-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.28-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.29-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.30-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.31-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.32-nvidia`
* `aws-k8s-1.33-nvidia`

The following variants support ECS:

* `aws-ecs-1`
* `aws-ecs-1-nvidia`
* `aws-ecs-2`
* `aws-ecs-2-nvidia`

We also have variants that are designed to be Kubernetes worker nodes in VMware:

* `vmware-k8s-1.28`
* `vmware-k8s-1.29`
* `vmware-k8s-1.30`
* `vmware-k8s-1.31`
* `vmware-k8s-1.32`
* `vmware-k8s-1.33`

The following variants are no longer supported:

* All Kubernetes variants using Kubernetes 1.25 and earlier
* VMware variants using Kubernetes 1.27 and earlier
* Bare metal variants for Kubernetes

We recommend users replace nodes running these variants with the [latest variant compatible with their cluster](variants/).

## Architectures

Our supported architectures include `x86_64` and `aarch64` (written as `arm64` in some contexts).

## Setup

:walking: :running:

Bottlerocket is best used with a container orchestrator.
To get started with Kubernetes in Amazon EKS, please see [QUICKSTART-EKS](QUICKSTART-EKS.md).
To get started with Kubernetes in VMware, please see [QUICKSTART-VMWARE](QUICKSTART-VMWARE.md).
To get started with Amazon ECS, please see [QUICKSTART-ECS](QUICKSTART-ECS.md).
These guides describe:

* how to set up a cluster with the orchestrator, so your Bottlerocket instance can run containers
* how to launch a Bottlerocket instance in EC2 or VMware

To see how to provision Bottlerocket on bare metal, see [PROVISIONING-METAL](PROVISIONING-METAL.md).

To build your own Bottlerocket images, please see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).
It describes:

* how to build an image
* how to register an EC2 AMI from an image

To publish your built Bottlerocket images, please see [PUBLISHING](PUBLISHING.md).
It describes:

* how to make TUF repos including your image
* how to copy your AMI across regions
* how to mark your AMIs public or grant access to specific accounts
* how to make your AMIs discoverable using [SSM parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)

## Exploration

To improve security, there&#039;s no SSH server in a Bottlerocket image, and not even a shell.

Don&#039;t panic!

There are a couple out-of-band access methods you can use to explore Bottlerocket like you would a typical Linux system.
Either option will give you a shell within Bottlerocket.
From there, you can [change settings](#settings), manually [update Bottlerocket](#updates), debug problems, and generally explore.

**Note:** These methods require that your instance has permission to access the ECR repository where these containers live; the appropriate policy to add to your instance&#039;s IAM role is `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`.

### Control container

Bottlerocket has a [&quot;control&quot; container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), enabled by default, that runs outside of the orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.
This container runs the [AWS SSM agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent) that lets you run commands, or start shell sessions, on Bottlerocket instances in EC2.
(You can easily replace this control container with your own just by changing the URI; see [Settings](#settings).)

In AWS, you need to give your instance the SSM role for this to work; see the [setup guide](QUICKSTART-EKS.md#enabling-ssm).
Outside of AWS, you can use [AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html).
There&#039;s more detail about hybrid environments in the [control container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container/#connecting-to-aws-systems-manager-ssm).

Once the instance is started, you can start a session:

* Go to AWS SSM&#039;s [Session Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/session-manager/sessions)
* Select &quot;Start session&quot; and choose your Bottlerocket instance
* Select &quot;Start session&quot; again to get a shell

If you prefer a command-line tool, you can start a session with a recent [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and the [session-manager-plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).
Then you&#039;d be able to start a session using only your instance ID, like this:

```shell
aws ssm start-session --target INSTANCE_ID --region REGION_CODE
```

With the [default control container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container), you can make [API calls](#api) to configure and manage your Bottlerocket host.
To do even more, read the next section about the [admin container](#admin-container).
You can access the admin container from the control container like this:

```shell
enter-admin-container
```

### Admin container

Bottlerocket has an [administrative container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container), disabled by default, that runs outside of the orchestrator in a separate instance of containerd.
This container has an SSH server that lets you log in as `ec2-user` using your EC2-registered SSH key.
Outside of AWS, you can [pass in your own SSH keys](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container#authenticating-with-the-admin-container).
(You can easily replace this admin container with your own just by changing the URI; see [Settings](#settings).

To enable the container, you can change the setting in user data when starting Bottlerocket, for example EC2 instance user data:

```toml
[settings.host-containers.admin]
enabled = true
```

If Bottlerocket is already running, you can enable the admin container from the default [control container](#control-container) like this:

```shell
enable-admin-container
```

Or you can start an interactive session immediately like this:

```shell
enter-admin-container
```

If you&#039;re using a custom control container, or want to make the API calls directly, you can enable the admin container like this instead:

```shell
apiclient set host-containers.admin.enabled=true
```

Once you&#039;ve enabled the admin container, you can either access it through SSH or execute commands from the control container like this:

```shell
apiclient exec admin bash
```

Once you&#039;re in the admin container, you can run `sheltie` to get a full root shell in the Bottlerocket host.
Be careful; while you can inspect and change even more as root, Bottlerocket&#039;s filesystem and dm-verity setup will prevent most changes from persisting over a restart - see [Security](#security).

## Updates

Rather than a package manager that updates individual pieces of software, Bottlerocket downloads a full filesystem image and reboots into it.
It can automatically roll back if boot failures occur, and workload failures can trigger manual rollbacks.

The update process uses images secured by [TUF](https://theupdateframework.github.io/).
For more details, see the [update system documentation](sources/updater/).

### Update methods

There are several ways of updating your Bottlerocket hosts.
We provide tools for automatically updating hosts, as well as an API for direct control of updates.

#### Automated updates

For EKS variants of Bottlerocket, we recommend using the [Bottlerocket update operator](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-update-operator) for automated updates.

For the ECS variant of Bottlerocket, we recommend using the [Bottlerocket ECS updater](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater/) for automated updates.

#### Update API

The [Bottlerocket API](#api) includes methods for checking and starting system updates.
You can read more about the update APIs in our [update system documentation](sources/updater/README.md#update-api).

apiclient knows how to handle those update APIs for you, and you can run it from the [control](#control-container) or [admin](#admin-container) containers.

To see what updates are available:

```shell
apiclient update check
```

If an update is available, it will show up in the `chosen_update` field.
The `available_updates` field will show the full list of available versions, including older versions, because Bottlerocket supports safely rolling back.

To apply the latest update:

```shell
apiclient update apply
```

The next time you reboot, you&#039;ll start up in the new version, and system configuration will be automatically [migrated](sources/api/migration/).
To reboot right away:

```shell
apiclient reboot
```

If you&#039;re confident about updating, the `apiclient update apply` command has `--check` and `--reboot` flags to combine the above actions, so you can accomplish all of the above steps like this:

```shell
apiclient update apply --check --reboot
```

See the [apiclient documentation](sources/api/apiclient/) for more details.

### Update rollback

The system will automatically roll back if it&#039;s unable to boot.
If the update is not functional for a given container workload, you can do a manual rollback:

```shell
signpost rollback-to-inactive
reboot
```

This doesn&#039;t require any external communication, so it&#039;s quicker than `apiclient`, and it&#039;s made to be as reliable as possible.

## Settings

Here we&#039;ll describe the settings you can configure on your Bottlerocket instance, and how to do it.

(API endpoints are defined in our [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-core-kit/tree/develop/sources/api/openapi.yaml) if you want more detail.)

### Interacting with settings

#### Using the API client

You can see the current settings with an API request:

```shell
apiclient get settings
```

This will return all of the current settings in JSON format.
For example, here&#039;s an abbreviated response:

```json
{&quot;motd&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, {&quot;kubernetes&quot;: {}}}
```

You can change settings like this:

```shell
apiclient set motd=&quot;hi there&quot; kubernetes.node-labels.environment=test
```

You can also use a JSON input mode to help change many related settings at once, and a &quot;raw&quot; mode if you want more control over how the settings are committed and applied to the system.
See the [apiclient README](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-core-kit/tree/develop/sources/api/apiclient/) for details.

#### Using user data

If you know what settings you want to change when you start your Bottlerocket instance, you can send them in the user data.

In user data, we structure the settings in TOML form to make things a bit simpler.
Here&#039;s the user data to change the message of the day setting, as we did in the last section:

```toml
[settings]
motd = &quot;my own value!&quot;
```

If your user data is over the size limit of the platform (e.g. 16KiB for EC2) you can compress the contents with gzip.
(With [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), you can use `--user-data fileb:///path/to/gz-file` to pass binary data.)

### Description of settings

Here we&#039;ll describe each setting you can change.

**Note:** You can see the default values (for any settings that are not generated at runtime) by looking in the `defaults.d` directory for a variant, for example [aws-ecs-2](sources/models/src/aws-ecs-2/defaults.d/).

When you&#039;re sending settings to the API, or receiving settings from the API, they&#039;re in a structured JSON format.
This allows modification of any number of keys at once.
It also lets us ensure that they fit the definition of the Bottlerocket data model - requests with invalid settings won&#039;t even parse correctly, helping ensure safety.

Here, however, we&#039;ll use the shortcut &quot;dotted key&quot; syntax for referring to keys.
This is used in some API endpoints with less-structured requests or responses.
It&#039;s also more compact for our needs here.

In this format, &quot;settings.kubernetes.cluster-name&quot; refers to the same key as in the JSON `{&quot;settings&quot;: {&quot;kubernetes&quot;: {&quot;cluster-name&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}}}`.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># probe-rs

a modern, embedded debugging toolkit,
written in Rust

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/probe-rs)](https://crates.io/crates/probe-rs) [![documentation](https://docs.rs/probe-rs/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/probe-rs) [![Actions Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/probe-rs/probe-rs/ci.yml?branch=master)](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/actions) [![chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-probe--rs%3Amatrix.org-brightgreen)](https://matrix.to/#/#probe-rs:matrix.org) ![GitHub Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/probe-rs)

The goal of this library is to provide a toolkit to interact with a variety of embedded MCUs and debug probes and provides a direct interface to the debug probe,
which then enables other software to use its debug functionality.

Additionally the project offers a variety of tools to be used directly for flashing and debugging, such as cargo extensions, a VS Code extension, a GDB server and a standalone CLI.

## Functionality

As of version 0.27.0 this library can:

- Connect to a DAPLink, STLink, JLink, FTDI probes, ESP32 devices with USB JTAG, WLink and the Blackmagic probe.
- Talk to ARM, Risc-V and Xtensa cores via SWD or JTAG.
- Read and write arbitrary memory of the target.
- Halt, run, step and step any core, operate breakpoints, enable trace functionality and much more.
- Download ELF, BIN and IHEX binaries using standard CMSIS-Pack flash algorithms.
- Debug a target via the CLI, VSCode (MS-DAP) and GDB.

To see what new functionality gets added every release, have a look at the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Support

If you think probe-rs makes your embedded journey more enjoyable or even earns you money, please consider supporting the project on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/probe-rs/) for better support and more features.

## Tools

In addition to being a library, probe-rs also includes a suite of tools which can be used for flashing and debugging.

### Installation

The recommended way to install the tools is to download a precompiled version, using one of the methods below.
See &lt;https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/installation&gt; for a more detailed guide.

### cargo-flash

The `cargo-flash` utility can be used as a cargo subcommand to download a compiled Rust program onto a target device. It can also be used to download arbitrary ELF files that might come out of a C/C++ compiler. Have a look at [cargo-flash](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/cargo-flash) for more information.

### cargo-embed

If you are looking for a more extended debugging experience, please have a look at [cargo-embed](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/cargo-embed) which provides support for GDB, RTT, and config files.

### Editors and IDEs

We have implemented the [Microsoft Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). This makes embedded debugging via probe-rs available in modern code editors implementing the standard, such as VSCode. The DAP website includes [a list of editors and IDEs which support DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/tools/).

#### VSCode

The probe-rs website includes [VSCode configuration instructions](https://probe.rs/docs/tools/debugger).

## Usage Examples

### Halting the attached chip

```rust,no_run
use probe_rs::probe::{list::Lister, Probe};
use probe_rs::Permissions;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), probe_rs::Error&gt; {
    // Get a list of all available debug probes.
    let lister = Lister::new();

    let probes = async_io::block_on(lister.list_all());

    // Use the first probe found.
    let mut probe = probes[0].open()?;

    // Attach to a chip.
    let mut session = probe.attach(&quot;nRF52840_xxAA&quot;, Permissions::default())?;

    // Select a core.
    let mut core = session.core(0)?;

    // Halt the attached core.
    core.halt(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Reading from RAM

```rust,no_run
use probe_rs::{MemoryInterface, Permissions, Session, SessionConfig};
use probe_rs::probe::WireProtocol;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), probe_rs::Error&gt; {
    // Attach to a chip.
    let speed = Some(5500);
    let protocol = Some(WireProtocol::Swd);
    let session_config = SessionConfig {
      speed,
      protocol,
      ..Default::default()
    };

    let mut session = async_io::block_on(Session::auto_attach(&quot;nRF52840_xxAA&quot;, session_config))?;

    // Select a core.
    let mut core = session.core(0)?;

    // Read a block of 50 32 bit words.
    let mut buff = [0u32; 50];
    core.read_32(0x2000_0000, &amp;mut buff)?;

    // Read a single 32 bit word.
    let word = core.read_word_32(0x2000_0000)?;

    // Writing is just as simple.
    let buff = [0u32; 50];
    core.write_32(0x2000_0000, &amp;buff)?;

    // of course we can also write 8bit words.
    let buff = [0u8; 50];
    core.write_8(0x2000_0000, &amp;buff)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## FAQ

### I need help!

Don&#039;t hesitate to [file an issue](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/issues/new), ask questions on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#probe-rs:matrix.org), or contact [@Yatekii](https://github.com/Yatekii) via e-mail.

There is also a [troubleshooting section](https://probe.rs/docs/knowledge-base/troubleshooting) on the [project page](https://probe.rs/).

### How can I help?

Please have a look at the issues or open one if you feel that something is needed.

Any contributions are very welcome!

Also have a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Our company needs feature X and would pay for its development

Please reach out to [@Yatekii](https://github.com/Yatekii)

### Building

Building requires Rust and Cargo which can be installed [using rustup](https://rustup.rs/). On Linux these can be installed with your package manager:

```console
# Ubuntu
&gt; sudo apt install -y libudev-dev

# Fedora
&gt; sudo dnf install -y libudev-devel
```

### Adding Targets

Target files are generated using [target-gen](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/tree/master/target-gen) from CMSIS packs provided [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/cmsis/cmsis-search).
Generated files are then placed in `probe-rs/targets` for inclusion in the probe-rs project.

### Updating STM32 targets

STM32 memory region data has been proven unreliable on multiple occasions. We now rely on [stm32-data](https://github.com/embassy-rs/stm32-data/tree/main) for the correct values. Use target-gen to update the list of devices and their flash algorithms, then use the https://github.com/bugadani/stm-probers tool to regenerate memory maps for all STM32 devices.

### Writing new flash algorithms

If there is no CMSIS-Pack with a flash algorithm available, it is necessary to write a target definition and a flash algorithm by oneself.
You can use our [template](https://github.com/probe-rs/flash-algorithm-template) for writing an algorithm. Please follow the instructions in the `README.md` in that repo.

## Acknowledgements

In early stages of this library, we profited invaluably from the pyOCD code to understand how flashing works. Also it&#039;s always a good reference to cross check how ARM specific things work. So, a big thank you to the team behind pyOCD!

## Prerequisites

See [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for software requirements to develop in this repo.

## Quickstart with the Linera CLI tool

The following commands set up a local test network and run some transfers between the
microchains owned by a single wallet.

```bash
# Make sure to compile the Linera binaries and add them in the $PATH.
# cargo build -p linera-storage-service -p linera-service --bins
export PATH=&quot;$PWD/target/debug:$PATH&quot;

# Import the optional helper function `linera_spawn`.
source /dev/stdin &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$(linera net helper 2&gt;/dev/null)&quot;

# Run a local test network with the default parameters and a number of microchains
# owned by the default wallet. This also defines `LINERA_TMP_DIR`.
linera_spawn \
linera net up --with-faucet --faucet-port 8080

# Remember the URL of the faucet.
FAUCET_URL=http://localhost:8080

# If you&#039;re using a testnet, start here and run this instead:
#   LINERA_TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.testnet-XXX.linera.net  # for some value XXX

# Set the path of the future wallet.
export LINERA_WALLET=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/wallet.json&quot;
export LINERA_KEYSTORE=&quot;$LINERA_TMP_DIR/keystore.json&quot;
export LINERA_STORAGE=&quot;rocksdb:$LINERA_TMP_DIR/client.db&quot;

# Initialize a new user wallet.
linera wallet init --faucet $FAUCET_URL

# Request chains.
INFO1=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
INFO2=($(linera wallet request-chain --faucet $FAUCET_URL))
CHAIN1=&quot;${INFO1[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT1=&quot;${INFO1[1]}&quot;
CHAIN2=&quot;${INFO2[0]}&quot;
ACCOUNT2=&quot;${INFO2[1]}&quot;

# Show the different chains tracked by the wallet.
linera wallet show

# Query the chain balance of some of the chains.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Transfer 10 units then 5 back.
linera transfer 10 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN2&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;

# Query balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2&quot;

# Now let&#039;s fund the user balances.
linera transfer 5 --from &quot;$CHAIN1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera transfer 2 --from &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot; --to &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;

# Query user balances again.
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN1:$ACCOUNT1&quot;
linera query-balance &quot;$CHAIN2:$ACCOUNT2&quot;
```

egui (pronounced &quot;e-gooey&quot;) is a simple, fast, and highly portable immediate mode GUI library for Rust. egui runs on the web, natively, and [in your favorite game engine](#integrations).

egui aims to be the easiest-to-use Rust GUI library, and the simplest way to make a web app in Rust.

egui can be used anywhere you can draw textured triangles, which means you can easily integrate it into your game engine of choice.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) is the official egui framework, which supports writing apps for Web, Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.


## Example

``` rust
ui.heading(&quot;My egui Application&quot;);
ui.horizontal(|ui| {
    ui.label(&quot;Your name: &quot;);
    ui.text_edit_singleline(&amp;mut name);
});
ui.add(egui::Slider::new(&amp;mut age, 0..=120).text(&quot;age&quot;));
if ui.button(&quot;Increment&quot;).clicked() {
    age += 1;
}
ui.label(format!(&quot;Hello &#039;{name}&#039;, age {age}&quot;));
ui.image(egui::include_image!(&quot;ferris.png&quot;));
```

([egui 的中文翻译文档 / chinese translation](https://github.com/Re-Ch-Love/egui-doc-cn/blob/main/README_zh-hans.md))


## Quick start

There are simple examples in [the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/). If you want to write a web app, then go to &lt;https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/&gt; and follow the instructions. The official docs are at &lt;https://docs.rs/egui&gt;. For inspiration and more examples, check out the [the egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) and follow the links in it to its source code.

If you want to integrate egui into an existing engine, go to the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

If you have questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions). There is also [an egui discord server](https://discord.gg/JFcEma9bJq). If you want to contribute to egui, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Demo

[Click to run egui web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) (works in any browser with Wasm and WebGL support). Uses [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe).

To test the demo app locally, run `cargo run --release -p egui_demo_app`.

The native backend is [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) (using [`glow`](https://crates.io/crates/glow)) and should work out-of-the-box on Mac and Windows, but on Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install -y libclang-dev libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

**NOTE**: This is just for the demo app - egui itself is completely platform agnostic!

## Goals

* The easiest to use GUI library
* Responsive: target 60 Hz in debug build
* Friendly: difficult to make mistakes, and shouldn&#039;t panic
* Portable: the same code works on the web and as a native app
* Easy to integrate into any environment
* A simple 2D graphics API for custom painting ([`epaint`](https://docs.rs/epaint)).
* Pure immediate mode: no callbacks
* Extensible: [easy to write your own widgets for egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/toggle_switch.rs)
* Modular: You should be able to use small parts of egui and combine them in new ways
* Safe: there is no `unsafe` code in egui
* Minimal dependencies

egui is *not* a framework. egui is a library you call into, not an environment you program for.

**NOTE**: egui does not claim to have reached all these goals yet! egui is still work in progress.

### Non-goals

* Become the most powerful GUI library
* Native looking interface

## State

egui is in active development. It works well for what it does, but it lacks many features and the interfaces are still in flux. New releases will have breaking changes.

Still, egui can be used to create professional looking applications, like [the Rerun Viewer](https://app.rerun.io/).

### Features

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing, color picker, spinner
* Images
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns, automatic wrapping
* Text editing: multiline, copy/paste, undo, emoji supports
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections), panels
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
* Accessibility via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/)
* Label text selection
* And more!

Check out the [3rd party egui crates wiki](https://github.com/emilk/egui/wiki/3rd-party-egui-crates) for even more
widgets and features, maintained by the community.

## Dependencies
`egui` has a minimal set of default dependencies:

* [`ab_glyph`](https://crates.io/crates/ab_glyph)
* [`ahash`](https://crates.io/crates/ahash)
* [`bitflags`](https://crates.io/crates/bitflags)
* [`nohash-hasher`](https://crates.io/crates/nohash-hasher)
* [`parking_lot`](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)

Heavier dependencies are kept out of `egui`, even as opt-in.
All code in `egui` is Wasm-friendly (even outside a browser).

To load images into `egui` you can use the official [`egui_extras`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_extras) crate.

[`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) on the other hand has a lot of dependencies, including [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image), graphics crates, clipboard crates, etc,

## Who is egui for?

egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

If you are not using Rust, egui is not for you. If you want a GUI that looks native, egui is not for you. If you want something that doesn&#039;t break when you upgrade it, egui isn&#039;t for you (yet).

But if you are writing something interactive in Rust that needs a simple GUI, egui may be for you.


## Integrations

egui is built to be easy to integrate into any existing game engine or platform you are working on.
egui itself doesn&#039;t know or care on what OS it is running or how to render things to the screen - that is the job of the egui integration.

An integration needs to do the following each frame:

* **Input**: Gather input (mouse, touches, keyboard, screen size, etc) and give it to egui
* Call into the application GUI code
* **Output**: Handle egui output (cursor changes, paste, texture allocations, …)
* **Painting**: Render the triangle mesh egui produces (see [OpenGL example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/crates/egui_glow/src/painter.rs))

### Official integrations

These are the official egui integrations:

* [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) for compiling the same app to web/wasm and desktop/native. Uses `egui-winit` and `egui_glow` or `egui-wgpu`
* [`egui_glow`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui_glow) for rendering egui with [glow](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) on native and web, and for making native apps
* [`egui-wgpu`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-wgpu) for [wgpu](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu) (WebGPU API)
* [`egui-winit`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/egui-winit) for integrating with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

### 3rd party integrations

## Why immediate mode

`egui` is an [immediate mode GUI library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI), as opposed to a *retained mode* GUI library. The difference between retained mode and immediate mode is best illustrated with the example of a button: In a retained GUI you create a button, add it to some UI and install some on-click handler (callback). The button is retained in the UI, and to change the text on it you need to store some sort of reference to it. By contrast, in immediate mode you show the button and interact with it immediately, and you do so every frame (e.g. 60 times per second). This means there is no need for any on-click handler, nor to store any reference to it. In `egui` this looks like this: `if ui.button(&quot;Save file&quot;).clicked() { save(file); }`.

A more detailed description of immediate mode can be found [in the `egui` docs](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/#understanding-immediate-mode).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems.

The short of it is this: immediate mode GUI libraries are easier to use, but less powerful.

### Advantages of immediate mode
#### Usability
The main advantage of immediate mode is that the application code becomes vastly simpler:

* You never need to have any on-click handlers and callbacks that disrupts your code flow.
* You don&#039;t have to worry about a lingering callback calling something that is gone.
* Your GUI code can easily live in a simple function (no need for an object just for the UI).
* You don&#039;t have to worry about app state and GUI state being out-of-sync (i.e. the GUI showing something outdated), because the GUI isn&#039;t storing any state - it is showing the latest state *immediately*.

In other words, a whole lot of code, complexity and bugs are gone, and you can focus your time on something more interesting than writing GUI code.

### Disadvantages of immediate mode

#### Layout
The main disadvantage of immediate mode is it makes layout more difficult. Say you want to show a small dialog window in the center of the screen. To position the window correctly the GUI library must first know the size of it. To know the size of the window the GUI library must first layout the contents of the window. In retained mode this is easy: the GUI library does the window layout, positions the window, then checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;).

In immediate mode you run into a paradox: to know the size of the window, we must do the layout, but the layout code also checks for interaction (&quot;was the OK button clicked?&quot;) and so it needs to know the window position *before* showing the window contents. This means we must decide where to show the window *before* we know its size!

This is a fundamental shortcoming of immediate mode GUIs, and any attempt to resolve it comes with its own downsides.

One workaround is to store the size and use it the next frame. This produces a frame-delay for the correct layout, producing occasional flickering the first frame something shows up. `egui` does this for some things such as windows and grid layouts.

The &quot;first-frame jitter&quot; can be covered up with an extra _pass_, which egui supports via `Context::request_discard`.
The downside of this is the added CPU cost of a second pass, so egui only does this in very rare circumstances (the majority of frames are single-pass).

For &quot;atomic&quot; widgets (e.g. a button) `egui` knows the size before showing it, so centering buttons, labels etc is possible in `egui` without any special workarounds.

See [this issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4378) for more.

#### CPU usage
Since an immediate mode GUI does a full layout each frame, the layout code needs to be quick. If you have a very complex GUI this can tax the CPU. In particular, having a very large UI in a scroll area (with very long scrollback) can be slow, as the content needs to be laid out each frame.

If you design the GUI with this in mind and refrain from huge scroll areas (or only lay out the part that is in view) then the performance hit is generally pretty small. For most cases you can expect `egui` to take up 1-2 ms per frame, but `egui` still has a lot of room for optimization (it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve focused on yet). `egui` only repaints when there is interaction (e.g. mouse movement) or an animation, so if your app is idle, no CPU is wasted.

If your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you&#039;ll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in `egui` by contrast, and you&#039;ll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost.


#### IDs
There are some GUI state that you want the GUI library to retain, even in an immediate mode library such as `egui`. This includes position and sizes of windows and how far the user has scrolled in some UI. In these cases you need to provide `egui` with a seed of a unique identifier (unique within the parent UI). For instance: by default `egui` uses the window titles as unique IDs to store window positions. If you want two windows with the same name (or one window with a dynamic name) you must provide some other ID source to `egui` (some unique integer or string).

`egui` also needs to track which widget is being interacted with (e.g. which slider is being dragged). `egui` uses unique IDs for this as well, but in this case the IDs are automatically generated, so there is no need for the user to worry about it. In particular, having two buttons with the same name is no problem (this is in contrast with [`Dear ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

Overall, ID handling is a rare inconvenience, and not a big disadvantage.


## FAQ

Also see [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Can I use `egui` with non-latin characters?
Yes! But you need to install your own font (`.ttf` or `.otf`) using [`Context::set_fonts`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/struct.Context.html#method.set_fonts).

### Can I customize the look of egui?
Yes! You can customize the colors, spacing, fonts and sizes of everything using `Context::set_style`.

This is not yet as powerful as say CSS, [but this is going to improve](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3284).

Here is an example (from https://github.com/a-liashenko/TinyPomodoro):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6107237-2547-41d6-996b-9a20ae0345ab&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### How do I use egui with `async`?
If you call `.await` in your GUI code, the UI will freeze, which is very bad UX. Instead, keep the GUI thread non-blocking and communicate with any concurrent tasks (`async` tasks or other threads) with something like:
* Channels (e.g. [`std::sync::mpsc::channel`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html)). Make sure to use [`try_recv`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.try_recv) so you don&#039;t block the gui thread!
* `Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Value&gt;&gt;` (background thread sets a value; GUI thread reads it)
* [`poll_promise::Promise`](https://docs.rs/poll-promise)
* [`eventuals::Eventual`](https://docs.rs/eventuals/latest/eventuals/struct.Eventual.html)
* [`tokio::sync::watch::channel`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/fn.channel.html)

### How do I create a file dialog?

The async version of [rfd](https://docs.rs/rfd/latest/rfd/) supports both native and Wasm. See example app here https://github.com/woelper/egui_pick_file which also has a demo available via [gitub pages](https://woelper.github.io/egui_pick_file/).

### What about accessibility, such as screen readers?
egui includes optional support for [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), which currently implements the native accessibility APIs on Windows and macOS. This feature is enabled by default in eframe. For platforms that AccessKit doesn&#039;t yet support, including web, there is an experimental built-in screen reader; in [the web demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) you can enable it in the &quot;Backend&quot; tab.

The original discussion of accessibility in egui is at &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167&gt;. Now that AccessKit support is merged, providing a strong foundation for future accessibility work, please open new issues on specific accessibility problems.

### What is the difference between [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe)?

`egui` is a 2D user interface library for laying out and interacting with buttons, sliders, etc.
`egui` has no idea if it is running on the web or natively, and does not know how to collect input or show things on screen.
That is the job of *the integration* or *backend*.

It is common to use `egui` from a game engine (using e.g. [`bevy_egui`](https://docs.rs/bevy_egui)),
but you can also use `egui` stand-alone using `eframe`. `eframe` has integration for web and native, and handles input and rendering.
The _frame_ in `eframe` stands both for the frame in which your egui app resides and also for &quot;framework&quot; (`eframe` is a framework, `egui` is a library).

### How do I render 3D stuff in an egui area?
There are multiple ways to combine egui with 3D. The simplest way is to use a 3D library and have egui sit on top of the 3D view. See for instance [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui) or [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d).

If you want to embed 3D into an egui view there are two options:

#### `Shape::Callback`
Example:
* &lt;https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/main/examples/custom_3d_glow/src/main.rs&gt;

`Shape::Callback` will call your code when egui gets painted, to show anything using whatever the background rendering context is. When using [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe) this will be [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow). Other integrations will give you other rendering contexts, if they support `Shape::Callback` at all.

Verus is a tool for verifying the correctness of code written in Rust.
Developers write specifications of what their code should do,
and Verus statically checks that the executable Rust code will always 
satisfy the specifications for all possible executions of the code.
Rather than adding run-time checks, Verus instead relies on powerful solvers to
prove the code is correct.  Verus currently supports a subset of Rust (which we
are working to expand), and in some cases, it allows developers to go beyond
the standard Rust type system and statically check the correctness of code
that, for example, manipulates raw pointers.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># @platformatic/php-node

With `@platformatic/php-node` you can run PHP applications within the same
process as a Node.js application, allowing for communication between Node.js
and PHP without any network connection in the middle. This allows for some
interesting possibilities, like running Wordpress with a Next.js frontend.

## Requirements

Presently support is provided for x64 Linux and both x64 and arm64 macOS. More
platforms will come as needs arise. Please open an issue if we&#039;re missing a
platform you would like supported!

PHP dynamically links against several system libraries. These must be installed
as listed below:

### Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev libonig-dev re2c
```

### macOS

```sh
brew install openssl@3 curl sqlite libxml2 oniguruma
```

## Install

```sh
npm install @platformatic/php-node
```

## Usage

```js
import { Php, Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const php = new Php()

const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;,
  headers: {
    &#039;X-Test&#039;: [&#039;Hello, from Node.js!&#039;]
  }
})

const response = await php.handleRequest(request)

console.log(response.body.toString())
```

## API

### `new Php(config)`

* `config` {Object} Configuration object
  * `argv` {String[]} Process arguments. **Default:** []
  * `docroot` {String} Document root for PHP. **Default:** process.cwd()
* Returns: {Php}

Construct a new PHP instance to which to dispatch requests.

```js
import { Php } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const php = new Php({
  argv: process.argv,
  docroot: process.cwd()
})
````

### `php.handleRequest(request)`

* `request` {Request} A request to dispatch to the PHP instance.
* Returns: {Promise&lt;Response&gt;}

When the request completes, the returned promise will resolve with the response
object. Request processing is handled by the NodePlatform worker pool to avoid
blocking the Node.js thread.

```js
import { Php, Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const php = new Php()
const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;
})

const response = await php.handleRequest(request)
console.log(response.body.toString())
````

### `php.handleRequestSync(request)`

* `request` {Request} A request to dispatch to the PHP instance.
* Returns: {Response}

Requests may also be processed synchronously, though this is not recommended as
it will block the Node.js thread for the entire life of the PHP request.

This may be useful for one-off scripts. It&#039;s only included because it&#039;s trivial
to do so, but it&#039;s not recommended for use within HTTP requests.

```js
import { Php, Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const php = new Php()
const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;
})

const response = php.handleRequestSync(request)
console.log(response.body.toString())
```

### `new Request(input)`

* `input`
  * `method` {String} HTTP method **Default:** `GET`
  * `url` {String} Full request URL
  * `headers` {Object} HTTP request headers. Each must be an array of strings
  * `body` {Buffer|UInt8Array} Request body
* Returns: {Request}

Construct a request which may be dispatched to a PHP instance.

```js
import { Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const request = new Request({
  method: &#039;POST&#039;,
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;,
  headers: {
    &#039;Content-Type&#039;: [&#039;application/json&#039;]
  },
  body: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({
    hello: &#039;world&#039;
  }))
})
```

### `request.method`

* {String}

The HTTP method to use when dispatching this request.

```js
import { Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;,
})

console.log(request.method) // GET
```

### `request.url`

* {String}

The URL to use when dispatching this request.

```js
import { Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;,
})

console.log(request.url) // http://example.com/foo/bar
```

### `request.headers`

* {Headers}

The HTTP headers to use when dispatching this request.

```js
import { Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;,
})

console.log(request.headers) // [Headers]
```

### `request.body`

* {Buffer}

The body to use when dispatching this request.

```js
import { Request } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const request = new Request({
  url: &#039;http://example.com/foo/bar&#039;,
  body: Buffer.from(&#039;Hello, world!&#039;)
})

console.log(request.body.toString()) // Hello, world!
```

### `new Response(input)`

* `input` {Object} Response values.
  * `status` {Number} HTTP Response status code
  * `headers` {Object} HTTP Response headers. Each must be an array of strings
  * `body` {Buffer} HTTP Response body
  * `log` {String} Log output of this request
* Returns: {Response}

Responses may be constructed manually. This is mainly just for testing, but may
have other uses, like short-circuiting the PHP instance run entirely in certain
cases.

```js
import { Response } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const response = new Response({
  status: 500,
  headers: {
    &#039;Content-Type&#039;: [&#039;application/json&#039;]
  },
  body: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({
    error: &#039;bad stuff&#039;
  }))
})
```

### `response.status`

* {Number}

The HTTP status code included in the response.

```js
import { Response } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const response = new Response({
  status: 500
})

console.log(response.status) // 500
```

### `response.headers`

* {Headers}

The HTTP headers included in the response.

```js
import { Response } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const response = new Response({
  headers: {
    &#039;Content-Type&#039;: [&#039;application/json&#039;]
  },
})

console.log(response.headers) // [Headers]
```

### `response.body`

* {Buffer}

The HTTP response body.

```js
import { Response } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const response = new Response({
  body: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({
    error: &#039;bad stuff&#039;
  }))
})

console.log(response.body.toString()) // {&quot;error&quot;:&quot;bad stuff&quot;}
```

### `response.log`

* {Buffer}

Any logs captured during the request.

```js
import { Response } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const response = new Response({
  log: Buffer.from(&#039;some log message&#039;)
})

console.log(response.log.toString()) // some log message
```

### `new Headers()`

* Returns: {Headers}

Construct a Headers object to manage HTTP headers. Note that this is currently
only useful for reading _from_ Request and Response types, not passing _into_
them.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()
```

### `headers.set(name, value)`

* `name` {String} The header name for which to set a value.
* `value` {String} The value to set for the named header.

This will set the value of the named header. If any prior headers have been
set with this name they will be discarded.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.set(&#039;Content-Type&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
```

### `headers.add(name, value)`

* `name` {String} The header name for which to add a value.
* `value` {String} The value to add for the named header.

This will add to the associated values of the named header. If any prior
headers have been set with this name they will also be kept.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;)
```

### `headers.has(name)`

* Returns: {bool}

Checks if there are any values currently associated with the header name.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.has(&#039;Content-Type&#039;) // false
```

### `headers.get(name)`

* Returns: {string|undefined}

Retrieves the last value associated with the given header name.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;)

headers.get(&#039;Accept&#039;) // text/html
```

### `headers.getAll(name)`

* Returns: {String[]}

Retrieves all values associated with the given header name.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;)

headers.getAll(&#039;Accept&#039;) // [&#039;application/json&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;]
```

### `headers.getLine(name)`

* Returns: {String|undefined}

Merges all associated values into one header line. Note that his may be
incorrect for some header types which require separate header lines such as
the `Set-Cookie` header.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;)

headers.getLine(&#039;Accept&#039;) // application/json, text/html
```

### `headers.delete(name)`

Delete all values associated with the given header name.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;)
headers.delete(&#039;Accept&#039;)

headers.get(&#039;Accept&#039;) // undefined
```

### `headers.clear()`

Remove all contained headers.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

headers.set(&#039;Content-Type&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.clear()

headers.get(&#039;Content-Type&#039;) // undefined
headers.get(&#039;Accept&#039;) // undefined
```

### `headers.size`

* {Number}

The number of header names present.

```js
import { Headers } from &#039;@platformatic/php-node&#039;

const headers = new Headers()

headers.set(&#039;Content-Type&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;application/json&#039;)
headers.add(&#039;Accept&#039;, &#039;text/html&#039;)

headers.size // 3
```

### `headers.entries()`

* {Iterator}

Returns an iterator containing a `(name, value)` tuple of header entries.
