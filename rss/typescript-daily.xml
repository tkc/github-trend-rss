Suna consists of four main components:

### Backend API
Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration with Anthropic, and others via LiteLLM.

### Frontend
Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker
Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features.

### Supabase Database
Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions.

## Run Locally / Self-Hosting

Suna can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. Follow these steps to set up your own instance.

### Requirements

You&#039;ll need the following components:
- A Supabase project for database and authentication
- Redis database for caching and session management
- Daytona sandbox for secure agent execution
- Python 3.11 for the API backend
- API keys for LLM providers (Anthropic)
- Tavily API key for enhanced search capabilities
- Firecrawl API key for web scraping capabilities

### Prerequisites

1. **Supabase**:
   - Create a new [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
   - Save your project&#039;s API URL, anon key, and service role key for later use
   - Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)

2. **Redis**: Set up a Redis instance using one of these options:
   - [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) (recommended for cloud deployments)
   - Local installation:
     - [Mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/redis): `brew install redis`
     - [Linux](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/): Follow distribution-specific instructions
     - [Windows](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-windows/): Use WSL2 or Docker
   - Docker Compose (included in our setup):
     - If you&#039;re using our Docker Compose setup, Redis is included and configured automatically
     - No additional installation is needed
   - Save your Redis connection details for later use (not needed if using Docker Compose)

3. **Daytona**:
   - Create an account on [Daytona](https://app.daytona.io/)
   - Generate an API key from your account settings
   - Go to [Images](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/images)
   - Click &quot;Add Image&quot;
   - Enter `adamcohenhillel/kortix-suna:0.0.20` as the image name
   - Set `/usr/bin/supervisord -n -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf` as the Entrypoint

4. **LLM API Keys**:
   - Obtain an API key [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
   - While other providers should work via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), Anthropic is recommended – the prompt needs to be adjusted for other providers to output correct XML for tool calls.

5. **Search API Key** (Optional):
   - For enhanced search capabilities, obtain an [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/)
   - For web scraping capabilities, obtain a [Firecrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev/)
  

6. **RapidAPI API Key** (Optional):
   - To enable API services like LinkedIn, and others, you&#039;ll need a RapidAPI key
   - Each service requires individual activation in your RapidAPI account:
     1. Locate the service&#039;s `base_url` in its corresponding file (e.g., `&quot;https://linkedin-data-scraper.p.rapidapi.com&quot;` in [`backend/agent/tools/data_providers/LinkedinProvider.py`](backend/agent/tools/data_providers/LinkedinProvider.py))
     2. Visit that specific API on the RapidAPI marketplace
     3. Subscribe to the service (many offer free tiers with limited requests)
     4. Once subscribed, the service will be available to your agent through the API Services tool

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kortix-ai/suna.git
cd suna
```

2. **Configure backend environment**:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env  # Create from example if available, or use the following template
```

Edit the `.env` file and fill in your credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;

# Supabase credentials from step 1
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Redis credentials from step 2
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
REDIS_SSL=True  # Set to False for local Redis without SSL

# Daytona credentials from step 3
DAYTONA_API_KEY=your_daytona_api_key
DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=&quot;https://app.daytona.io/api&quot;
DAYTONA_TARGET=&quot;us&quot;

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# OpenAI API:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional but recommended
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key  # For enhanced search capabilities
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key  # For web scraping capabilities
RAPID_API_KEY=
```

3. **Set up Supabase database**:
```bash
# Login to Supabase CLI
supabase login

# Link to your project (find your project reference in the Supabase dashboard)
supabase link --project-ref your_project_reference_id

# Push database migrations
supabase db push
```

Then, go to the Supabase web platform again -&gt; choose your project -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Data API -&gt; And in the &quot;Exposed Schema&quot; ass &quot;basejump&quot; if not already there

4. **Configure frontend environment**:
```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env.local  # Create from example if available, or use the following template
```

   Edit the `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=&quot;http://localhost:8000/api&quot;  # Use this for local development
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;
```

   Note: If you&#039;re using Docker Compose, use the container name instead of localhost:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=&quot;http://backend:8000/api&quot;  # Use this when running with Docker Compose
```

5. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Start the application**:

   In one terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

   In another terminal, start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python api.py
```

5-6. **Docker Compose Alternative**:

Before running with Docker Compose, make sure your environment files are properly configured:
- In `backend/.env`, set all the required environment variables as described above
  - For Redis configuration, use `REDIS_HOST=redis` instead of localhost
  - The Docker Compose setup will automatically set these Redis environment variables:
    ```
    REDIS_HOST=redis
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    REDIS_PASSWORD=
    REDIS_SSL=False
    ```
- In `frontend/.env.local`, make sure to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=&quot;http://backend:8000/api&quot;` to use the container name

Then run:
```bash
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=&quot;your-github-username/repo-name&quot;
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yaml up
```

If you&#039;re building the images locally instead of using pre-built ones:
```bash
docker compose up
```

The Docker Compose setup includes a Redis service that will be used by the backend automatically.


7. **Access Suna**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Sign up for an account using the Supabase authentication
   - Start using your self-hosted Suna instance!

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Let AI build multi-agent workflows for you in minutes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

[Quickstart](#quick-start) | [Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/) | [Website](https://www.rowboatlabs.com/) |  [Discord](https://discord.gg/jHhUKkKHn8) 

&lt;/h5&gt;

- ✨ **Start from an idea -&gt; copilot builds your multi-agent workflows**
   - E.g. &quot;Build me an assistant for a food delivery company to handle delivery status and missing items. Include the necessary tools.&quot;
- 🌐 **Connect MCP servers**
   - Add the MCP servers in settings -&gt; import the tools into Rowboat.     
- 📞 **Integrate into your app using the HTTP API or Python SDK**
   - Grab the project ID and generated API key from settings and use the API.

Powered by OpenAI&#039;s Agents SDK, Rowboat is the fastest way to build multi-agents!

## Quick start
1. Set your OpenAI key
      ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```
      
2. Clone the repository and start Rowboat docker
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rowboatlabs/rowboat.git
   cd rowboat
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Demo

#### Create a multi-agent assistant with MCP tools by chatting with Rowboat
[![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 00 25 31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a41622-8e0e-459f-becb-767503489866)](https://youtu.be/YRTCw9UHRbU)

## Integrate with Rowboat agents

There are 2 ways to integrate with the agents you create in Rowboat

1. HTTP API
   - You can use the API directly at [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/)
   - See [API Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_api/) for details
   ```bash
   curl --location &#039;http://localhost:3000/api/v1/&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;/chat&#039; \
   --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
   --header &#039;Authorization: Bearer &lt;API_KEY&gt;&#039; \
   --data &#039;{
       &quot;messages&quot;: [
           {
               &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
               &quot;content&quot;: &quot;tell me the weather in london in metric units&quot;
           }
       ],
       &quot;state&quot;: null
   }&#039;
   ```
   

2. Python SDK
   You can use the included Python SDK to interact with the Agents
   ```
   pip install rowboat
   ```

   See [SDK Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_sdk/) for details. Here is a quick example:
   ```python
   from rowboat import Client, StatefulChat
   from rowboat.schema import UserMessage, SystemMessage

   # Initialize the client
   client = Client(
       host=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
       project_id=&quot;&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;&quot;,
       api_key=&quot;&lt;API_KEY&gt;&quot;
   )

   # Create a stateful chat session (recommended)
   chat = StatefulChat(client)
   response = chat.run(&quot;What&#039;s the weather in London?&quot;)
   print(response)

   # Or use the low-level client API
   messages = [
       SystemMessage(role=&#039;system&#039;, content=&quot;You are a helpful assistant&quot;),
       UserMessage(role=&#039;user&#039;, content=&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;)
   ]
   
   # Get response
   response = client.chat(messages=messages)
   print(response.messages[-1].content)
   ```

## Introduction

**What does Hyprnote do?**

- Records and transcribes your meetings  
- Generates **powerful summaries** from your raw meeting notes

**What’s special about it?**

- &lt;ins&gt;Works **offline**&lt;/ins&gt; using **open-source models** (_Whisper_ &amp; _Llama_)  
- Highly [extensible](https://docs.hyprnote.com/extensions/), powered by [plugins](https://docs.hyprnote.com/plugins/)

## Installation

```bash
brew tap fastrepl/hyprnote &amp;&amp; brew install hyprnote --cask
```

- [Macos](https://hyprnote.com/download) (public beta)
- [Windows](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/66) (soon)
- [Linux](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/67) (maybe)

## Highlights

### Hypercharge your notes
Casually jot stuff down and Hyprnote will craft a meeting note based on your memos.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1615a9f0-7a30-44c1-b142-0d1774a84e89&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

### Offline &amp; Privacy
Hyprnote is local-first which means you can be off the grid and it&#039;s perfectly fine.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5014024-3f6a-457a-8f1c-3b183883b782&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

### Extensions &amp; Plugins
Just like VSCode, You can add or create extensions based on your circumstances.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/341d2e6c-a2c7-432b-95b8-fdc2018838d5&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

For example, [transcript extension](https://docs.hyprnote.com/extensions/transcript.html) is powered by [listener plugin](https://docs.hyprnote.com/plugins/listener.html).

```ts
useEffect(() =&gt; {
  const channel = new Channel&lt;SessionEvent&gt;();
  listenerCommands.subscribe(channel);

  channel.onmessage = (e) =&gt; {
    if (e.type === &quot;started&quot;) {
      setIsLive(true);
    }
    if (e.type === &quot;stopped&quot;) {
      setIsLive(false);
    }
  };

  return () =&gt; {
    listenerCommands.unsubscribe(channel);
  };
}, []);
```

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features, and more, allowing you to quickly move from prototype to production.

## Quick start

&gt; Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
&gt;
&gt; - CPU &gt;= 2 Core
&gt; - RAM &gt;= 4 GiB

&lt;/br&gt;

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [docker compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

## [Documentation](https://playwright.dev) | [API reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**.

Headless execution is supported for all browsers on all platforms. Check out [system requirements](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#system-requirements) for details.

## Installation

Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.

### Using init command

The easiest way to get started with Playwright Test is to run the init command.

```Shell
# Run from your project&#039;s root directory
npm init playwright@latest
# Or create a new project
npm init playwright@latest new-project
```

This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts. You can now jump directly to writing assertions section.

### Manually

Add dependency and install browsers.

```Shell
npm i -D @playwright/test
# install supported browsers
npx playwright install
```

You can optionally install only selected browsers, see [install browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#install-browsers) for more details. Or you can install no browsers at all and use existing [browser channels](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).

## Capabilities

### Resilient • No flaky tests

**Auto-wait**. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - a primary cause of flaky tests.

**Web-first assertions**. Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.

**Tracing**. Configure test retry strategy, capture execution trace, videos and screenshots to eliminate flakes.

### No trade-offs • No limits

Browsers run web content belonging to different origins in different processes. Playwright is aligned with the architecture of the modern browsers and runs tests out-of-process. This makes Playwright free of the typical in-process test runner limitations.

**Multiple everything**. Test scenarios that span multiple tabs, multiple origins and multiple users. Create scenarios with different contexts for different users and run them against your server, all in one test.

**Trusted events**. Hover elements, interact with dynamic controls and produce trusted events. Playwright uses real browser input pipeline indistinguishable from the real user.

Test frames, pierce Shadow DOM. Playwright selectors pierce shadow DOM and allow entering frames seamlessly.

### Full isolation • Fast execution

**Browser contexts**. Playwright creates a browser context for each test. Browser context is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context only takes a handful of milliseconds.

**Log in once**. Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests.

### Powerful Tooling

**[Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen)**. Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language.

**[Playwright inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector)**. Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points and explore execution logs.

**[Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer)**. Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source and many more.

## Examples

To learn how to run these Playwright Test examples, check out our [getting started docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

#### Page screenshot

This code snippet navigates to Playwright homepage and saves a screenshot.

```TypeScript
import { test } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test(&#039;Page Screenshot&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  await page.goto(&#039;https://playwright.dev/&#039;);
  await page.screenshot({ path: `example.png` });
});
```

#### Mobile and geolocation

This snippet emulates Mobile Safari on a device at given geolocation, navigates to maps.google.com, performs the action and takes a screenshot.

```TypeScript
import { test, devices } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test.use({
  ...devices[&#039;iPhone 13 Pro&#039;],
  locale: &#039;en-US&#039;,
  geolocation: { longitude: 12.492507, latitude: 41.889938 },
  permissions: [&#039;geolocation&#039;],
})

test(&#039;Mobile and geolocation&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  await page.goto(&#039;https://maps.google.com&#039;);
  await page.getByText(&#039;Your location&#039;).click();
  await page.waitForRequest(/.*preview\/pwa/);
  await page.screenshot({ path: &#039;colosseum-iphone.png&#039; });
});
```

#### Evaluate in browser context

This code snippet navigates to example.com, and executes a script in the page context.

```TypeScript
import { test } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test(&#039;Evaluate in browser context&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  await page.goto(&#039;https://www.example.com/&#039;);
  const dimensions = await page.evaluate(() =&gt; {
    return {
      width: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
      height: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
      deviceScaleFactor: window.devicePixelRatio
    }
  });
  console.log(dimensions);
});
```

#### Intercept network requests

This code snippet sets up request routing for a page to log all network requests.

```TypeScript
import { test } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test(&#039;Intercept network requests&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  // Log and continue all network requests
  await page.route(&#039;**&#039;, route =&gt; {
    console.log(route.request().url());
    route.continue();
  });
  await page.goto(&#039;http://todomvc.com&#039;);
});
```

## Pre-requisites

- Before proceeding, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20.11.0 is required)
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Verification

To verify the installation, perform the following checks in your terminal:

- Ensure that the `docker` commands are available:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  docker compose version
## Fast start

```bash
sh ./scripts/fast-start.sh
```

## Installation

You need Microsoft&#039;s [rush](https://rushjs.io) to install application.

1. Install Rush globally using the command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/rush
2. Navigate to the repository root and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   rush install
   rush build
Alternatively, you can just execute:

```bash
sh ./scripts/presetup-rush.sh
```

## Build and run

Development environment setup requires Docker to be installed on system.

Support is available for both amd64 and arm64 containers on Linux and macOS.

```bash
cd ./dev/
rush build    # Will build all the required packages. 
# rush rebuild  # could be used to omit build cache.
rush bundle   # Will prepare bundles.
rush package  # Will build all webpack packages.
rush validate # Will validate all sources with typescript and generate d.ts files required for ts-node execution.
rush svelte-check # Optional. svelte files validation using svelte-check.
rush docker:build   # Will build Docker containers for all applications in the local Docker environment.
rush docker:up # Will set up all the containers
```

Be aware `rush docker:build` will automatically execute all required phases like build, bundle, package.

Alternatively, you can just execute:

```bash
sh ./scripts/build.sh
```

By default, Docker volumes named dev_db, dev_elastic, and dev_files will be created for the MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and MinIO instances.

Before you can begin, you need to create a workspace and an account and associate it with the workspace.

```bash
cd ./tool # dev/tool in the repository root
rushx run-local create-workspace ws1 -w DevWorkspace # Create workspace
rushx run-local create-account user1 -p 1234 -f John -l Appleseed # Create account
rushx run-local configure ws1 --list --enable &#039;*&#039; # Enable all modules, even if they are not yet intended to be used by a wide audience.
rushx run-local assign-workspace user1 ws1 # Assign workspace to user.
rushx run-local confirm-email user1 # To allow the creation of additional test workspaces.

```

Alternatively, you can just execute:

```bash
sh ./scripts/create-workspace.sh
```

Add the following line to your /etc/hosts file

```
127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal
```

Accessing the URL http://host.docker.internal:8087 will lead you to the app in development mode.

Limitations:

- Local installation does not support sending emails, thus disabling functionalities such as password recovery and email notifications.

## Run in development mode

Development mode allows for live reloading and a smoother development process.

```bash
cd dev/prod
rush validate
rushx dev-server
```

Then go to http://localhost:8080

Click on &quot;Login with password&quot; link on the bottom of the right panel and use the following login credentials:

```plain
Email: user1
Password: 1234
Workspace: ws1
```

## Update project structure and database

If the project&#039;s structure is updated, it may be necessary to relink and rebuild the projects.

```bash
rush update
rush build
```

It may also be necessary to upgrade the running database.

```bash
cd ./dev/tool
rushx upgrade -f
```

## Troubleshooting

If a build fails, but the code is correct, try to delete the [build cache](https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/build_cache/) and retry.

```bash
# from the project root
rm -rf common/temp/build-cache
```

## Build &amp; Watch

For development purpose `rush build:watch` action could be used.

It includes build and validate phases in watch mode.

## Tests

### Unit tests

```bash
rush test # To execute all tests

rushx test # For individual test execution inside a package directory
```

### UI tests

```bash
cd ./tests
rush build
rush bundle
rush docker:build
## creates test Docker containers and sets up test database
./prepare.sh
## runs UI tests
rushx uitest
```

To execute tests in the development environment, please follow these steps:

```bash
cd ./tests
./create-local.sh ## use ./restore-local.sh if you only want to restore the workspace to a predefined initial state for sanity.
cd ./sanity
rushx dev-uitest # To execute all tests against the development environment.
rushx dev-debug -g &#039;pattern&#039; # To execute tests in debug mode with only the matching test pattern.
```

## Package publishing

```bash
node ./common/scripts/bump.js -p projectName
```

## Additional testing

This project is tested with BrowserStack.

## 🔎 System Architecture

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/assets/12318111/d6ac5664-c237-4200-a7c2-a4a00691b485&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## 🎬 Get Started

### 📝 Prerequisites

- CPU &gt;= 4 cores
- RAM &gt;= 16 GB
- Disk &gt;= 50 GB
- Docker &gt;= 24.0.0 &amp; Docker Compose &gt;= v2.26.1
  &gt; If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux),
  &gt; see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 🚀 Start up the server

1. Ensure `vm.max_map_count` &gt;= 262144:

   &gt; To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; $ sysctl vm.max_map_count
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; # In this case, we set it to 262144:
   &gt; $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the
   &gt; `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```

2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   ```

3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don&#039;t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.
&gt; If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.

   &gt; The command below downloads the `v0.18.0-slim` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.18.0-slim`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server. For example: set `RAGFLOW_IMAGE=infiniflow/ragflow:v0.18.0` for the full edition `v0.18.0`.

   ```bash
   $ cd ragflow/docker
   # Use CPU for embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

   # To use GPU to accelerate embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   # docker compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up -d
   ```

   | RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?                  |
   |-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
   | v0.18.0           | &amp;approx;9       | :heavy_check_mark:    | Stable release           |
   | v0.18.0-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                   | Stable release            |
   | nightly           | &amp;approx;9       | :heavy_check_mark:    | _Unstable_ nightly build |
   | nightly-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                   | _Unstable_ nightly build  |

4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:

   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f ragflow-server
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ```bash

         ____   ___    ______ ______ __
        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __
       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /
      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /
     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/

    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
   ```

   &gt; If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network anormal`
   &gt; error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.

5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.
   &gt; With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default
   &gt; HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.
6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update
   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.

   &gt; See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.

   _The show is on!_

## 🔧 Configurations

When it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:

- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and
  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.
- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.

&gt; The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service
&gt; configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.

To update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`
to `&lt;YOUR_SERVING_PORT&gt;:80`.

Updates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:

&gt; ```bash
&gt; $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
&gt; ```

### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity

RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:

1. Stop all running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.

2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.

3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.

## 🔧 Build a Docker image without embedding models

This image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg LIGHTEN=1 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly-slim .
```

## 🔧 Build a Docker image including embedding models

This image is approximately 9 GB in size. As it includes embedding models, it relies on external LLM services only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

## 🔨 Launch service from source for development

1. Install uv, or skip this step if it is already installed:

   ```bash
   pipx install uv pre-commit
   ```

2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   cd ragflow/
   uv sync --python 3.10 --all-extras # install RAGFlow dependent python modules
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d
   ```

   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:

   ```
   127.0.0.1       es01 infinity mysql minio redis
   ```

4. If you cannot access HuggingFace, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to use a mirror site:

   ```bash
   export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   ```

5. Launch backend service:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
   bash docker/launch_backend_service.sh
   ```

6. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```
7. Launch frontend service:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

## From Recording to Writing

Conventional note-taking applications typically don&#039;t provide recording functionality. Users need to manually copy and paste content for recording, which greatly reduces efficiency. When faced with scattered recorded content, it requires significant effort to organize.

NoteGen is divided into `Recording` and `Writing` pages, with the following relationship:

- Recordings can be organized into notes and transferred to the writing page for in-depth composition.
- During writing, you can insert recordings at any time.

### Recording

The recording function is similar to an **AI chatbot**, but when conversing with it, you can associate it with previously recorded content, switching from conversation mode to organization mode to arrange recordings into a readable note.

The following auxiliary features can help you record more effectively:

- **Tags** to distinguish different recording scenarios.
- **Personas** with support for custom prompts to precisely control your AI assistant.
- **Clipboard Assistant** that automatically recognizes text or images in your clipboard and records them to your list.

### Writing

The writing section is divided into two parts: **File Manager** and **Markdown Editor**.

**File Manager**

- Supports management of local Markdown files and GitHub synchronized files.
- Supports unlimited directory hierarchy.
- Supports multiple sorting methods.

**Markdown Editor**

- Supports WYSIWYG, instant rendering, and split-screen preview modes.
- Supports version control with history rollback.
- Supports AI assistance for conversation, continuation, polishing, and translation functions.
- Supports image hosting, uploading images and converting them to Markdown image links.
- Supports HTML to Markdown conversion, automatically converting copied browser content to Markdown format.
- Supports outlines, math formulas, mind maps, charts, flowcharts, Gantt charts, sequence diagrams, staves, multimedia, voice reading, title anchors, code highlighting and copying, graphviz rendering, and plantuml UML diagrams.
- Supports real-time local content saving, delayed (10s without editing) automatic synchronization, and history rollback.

## Other Features

- Global search for quickly finding and jumping to specific content.
- Image hosting management for convenient management of image repository content.
- Themes and appearance with support for dark themes and appearance settings for Markdown, code, etc.
- Internationalization support, currently available in Chinese and English.

## How to Use?

### Download

Currently supports Mac, Windows, and Linux. Thanks to Tauri2&#039;s cross-platform capabilities, it will support iOS and Android in the future.

## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&amp;nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&amp;nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&amp;nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&amp;nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).

# how it works?

- we record everything 24/7, 100% locally, uses 10% CPU, 4 GB ram, 15 gb/m
- we index it into an api
- dev build ai apps w user&#039;s full context, desktop native, nextjs, publish, monetize

&lt;img src=&quot;./content/diagram2.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da5b8583-550f-4a1f-b211-058e7869bc91&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;



# why?

- ai models are commoditized 
- ai is as good as its context
- the most valuable context is all contained in your screen


## get started

macos, linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL get.screenpi.pe/cli | sh
```

or on windows

```bash
iwr get.screenpi.pe/cli.ps1 | iex
```

then

```bash
screenpipe
```

make sure to allow permissions on macos (screen, mic)

- [get the desktop app](https://screenpi.pe/)
- [docs &amp; build from source](https://docs.screenpi.pe/getting-started)

## create plugins

```bash
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe create
```

screenpipe has a plugin system called &quot;pipe&quot; which lets you create desktop app in nextjs in a sandboxed environment within our Rust code, [read more](https://docs.screenpi.pe/plugins)

you can then publish these to our store and make money:

```bash
cd foo
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe register --name foo [--paid --price 50] # subscription
bun run build
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe publish --name foo
```

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

## Contribution

Better Auth is free and open source project licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md). You are free to do whatever you want with it.

&lt;/div&gt;

## ⚡ Introduction

By constructing sentences with conjunctions, it helps you learn English better~ 😊

## 🚀 How To Start?

**The mentioned operations below are based on the root directory of the current project, please be attentive to ensure there are no errors!**

### Requirements

- **pnpm version &gt;= 8**

  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```

- **Node.js version &gt;= v20**
  &gt; Use the version from .node-version. [Supported tools](https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage#compatibility-testing)
- **Postgres version &gt;= 14.0.0**
- **Redis version &gt;= 5.0.0**
- **Docker**. please make sure it is installed and running successfully on your local machine.

```bash
docker --version # Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b

node --version # v20+

pnpm -v # 8+
```

### Editor

#### VSCode

- Install the recommended extensions [extensions.json](./.vscode/extensions.json)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure the `.env` File

You can choose to copy the contents of `./apps/api/.env.example` to`./apps/api/.env`. note that the&#039; example&#039; file contains sample configuration. the main storage system&#039;s environment variable information, such as database connection address, user name, password, port, key, etc. the back-end service will read the configuration from this file, **of course you can also change it to your own configuration information**.

Windows users recommend shortcut keys to copy and paste, Linux users can operate through the following command.

#### Server

```bash
cp ./apps/api/.env.example ./apps/api/.env
```

#### Client

```bash
cp ./apps/client/.env.example ./apps/client/.env
```

### 3. Restore Data Of Logto

Uncompress `logto_db_init_data.zip` to `.volumes/`

```bash
unzip logto_db_init_data.zip -d .volumes/
```

- Admin URL: http://localhost:3011
- Username: admin
- Password: WkN7g5-i8ZrJckX

&gt; if you want to [Manual Configuration Logto](https://github.com/cuixueshe/earthworm/wiki/%E8%BF%81%E7%A7%BB-Logto-%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%90%8E%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%EF%BC%88%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE%E8%80%85%EF%BC%89)

### 4. Start Docker Compose Service

The backend relies on Postgres and Redis services. Start and stop these services using the commands configured in `package.json` below.

```bash
# start
pnpm docker:start

# When needed, execute the following command
# stop
pnpm docker:stop
# delete
pnpm docker:delete
# Complete deletion (including Volume data)
pnpm docker:down
```

If you prefer manual, you can use the commands below.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose stop
docker compose down

# commands compatible with older versions of Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Initialize Database Schema

When executing this command, try to keep a little time from the previous command, because the `-d` parameter just used will suspend its service execution in the background. At this time, the docker service may still be running. If an error is found, execute it again.

```bash
pnpm db:init
```

### 6. Create and Upload Course Data

**Only Execute This During the Initial Database Initialization**.

```bash
pnpm db:upload
```

### 7. Start the Backend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:serve
```

### 8. Start the Frontend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:client
```

## 🛠️ About testing

**Run the test before submitting the commit, and submit the code after the test passes, so as to avoid multiple commits to solve the test problem**.

### Front-end Testing

The main is the single test of Vitest and the automated test of cypress, execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter the front-end project directory
cd apps/client

# vitest
pnpm test:unit:run
# cypress
pnpm test:e2e:run

# monitor vitest, convenient hot update to see test results
pnpm test:unit:watch
```

### Backend Testing

Mainly Jest single test and end-to-end test, but need to access the test database, so you need to ensure that:

1. testdb and testRedis services in Docker Compose started normally.
2. The configuration information in the `.env.test` file is correct. If there is no such file, you can copy the contents of the `apps/api/.env.test.example` file to the `apps/api/.env.test` file. The following command is provided to directly use.

Execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter Backend Project Directory
cd apps/api

# If you have an.env.test file, you don&#039;t need to run this step
cp .env.test.example .env.test

# Single test
pnpm test:unit
# End-to-end testing
pnpm test:e2e
# Single test and end-to-end test run together
pnpm test
```

## Docs Project

Project based on Vitepress documentation，execute the following command:

```bash
# Local Development
pnpm docs:dev
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Database connection failed

My Docker and the database inside are running normally, but when I run the `db:init` command, I still report an error, indicating that the database connection failed.

You can check whether the database configuration in the `.env` file is correct, or even whether this file has it! 😠

### How To Correctly Update Course Data?

when you identify incorrect course data and make modifications, you should use the following command to update the course data in the database.

```bash
pnpm db:update
```

### pnpm Install Error?

Some dependencies require compilation during installation, necessitating the presence of relevant build environments.
If these environments are not available, the compilation process may fail. Additionally, different modules may require different build environments, so specific issues need to be analyzed individually.
Below are specific problems encountered along with their solutions.

First try the following command to update `pnpm`.

```shell
pnpm i -g
# or
pnpm i -g pnpm
# or
npx pnpm i -g pnpm@latest
```

**Error Installing the argon2 Module On Windows**

- Install Visual Studio 2015 or later, specifically the &quot;Desktop development with C++&quot; component. (In practice, any component containing C++ development tools and libraries will suffice.)
- If you encounter Chinese characters display issues during compilation, execute `chcp 437` in the command prompt, then rerun the install command.

### Docker Permission Denied in Docker?

When using WSL2 as a development environment in Windows, the following error occurs when starting Docker with `docker compose up -d` :

```bash
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get &quot;http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json&quot;: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

&gt; Solution

Add the current user to the docker group

```bash
# Add docker user group
sudo groupadd docker
# Add the logged-in user to the docker user group
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
# Update user group
newgrp docker
# Test if docker command is working properly
docker images
```

## 🤝 Frontend Development Guideline

1. Do not Destructure Pinia store.

   - The readability will be better when using `store`
   - Destructuring can lead to reactivity loss and using `storeToRefs` is also quite cumbersome

2. Avoid including UI logic in composables.

   - Such as `toast.info()`
   - We categorize the router as UI logic, and for ease of testing, avoid including routerrelated logic in there

## How it works

Supabase is a combination of open source tools. We’re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn&#039;t exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.

**Architecture**

Supabase is a [hosted platform](https://supabase.com/dashboard). You can sign up and start using Supabase without installing anything.
You can also [self-host](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) and [develop locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development).

![Architecture](apps/docs/public/img/supabase-architecture.svg)

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) is an Elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts, updates, and deletes using websockets. Realtime polls Postgres&#039; built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over websockets to authorized clients.
- [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/) is a web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API.
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue) is a JWT-based authentication API that simplifies user sign-ups, logins, and session management in your applications.
- [Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api) a RESTful API for managing files in S3, with Postgres handling permissions.
- [pg_graphql](http://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql/) a PostgreSQL extension that exposes a GraphQL API.
- [postgres-meta](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta) is a RESTful API for managing your Postgres, allowing you to fetch tables, add roles, and run queries, etc.
- [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) is a cloud-native API gateway.

#### Client libraries

Our approach for client libraries is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.
