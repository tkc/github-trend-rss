Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker&lt;nobr&gt; microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

Using Appwrite, you can easily integrate your app with user authentication and multiple sign-in methods, a database for storing and querying users and team data, storage and file management, image manipulation, Cloud Functions, messaging, and [more services](https://appwrite.io/docs).

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with Appwrite is by [signing up for Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/). While Appwrite Cloud is in public beta, you can build with Appwrite completely free, and we won&#039;t collect you credit card information. 

## Self-Hosting

Appwrite is designed to run in a containerized environment. Running your server is as easy as running one command from your terminal. You can either run Appwrite on your localhost using docker-compose or on any other container orchestration tool, such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/).

Before running the installation command, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine:

### Unix

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --volume &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \
    --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; \
    appwrite/appwrite:1.7.0
```

### Windows

#### CMD

```cmd
docker run -it --rm ^
    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    --volume &quot;%cd%&quot;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^
    --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; ^
    appwrite/appwrite:1.7.0
```

#### PowerShell

```powershell
docker run -it --rm `
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
    --volume ${pwd}/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw `
    --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; `
    appwrite/appwrite:1.7.0
```

Once the Docker installation is complete, go to http://localhost to access the Appwrite console from your browser. Please note that on non-Linux native hosts, the server might take a few minutes to start after completing the installation.

For advanced production and custom installation, check out our Docker [environment variables](https://appwrite.io/docs/environment-variables) docs. You can also use our public [docker-compose.yml](https://appwrite.io/install/compose) and [.env](https://appwrite.io/install/env) files to manually set up an environment.

### Upgrade from an Older Version

If you are upgrading your Appwrite server from an older version, you should use the Appwrite migration tool once your setup is completed. For more information regarding this, check out the [Installation Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting).

## One-Click Setups

In addition to running Appwrite locally, you can also launch Appwrite using a pre-configured setup. This allows you to get up and running quickly with Appwrite without installing Docker on your local machine.

Choose from one of the providers below:

## Architecture

![Appwrite Architecture showing how Appwrite is built and the services and tools it uses](docs/specs/overview.drawio.svg)

Appwrite uses a microservices architecture that was designed for easy scaling and delegation of responsibilities. In addition, Appwrite supports multiple APIs, such as REST, WebSocket, and GraphQL to allow you to interact with your resources by leveraging your existing knowledge and protocols of choice.

The Appwrite API layer was designed to be extremely fast by leveraging in-memory caching and delegating any heavy-lifting tasks to the Appwrite background workers. The background workers also allow you to precisely control your compute capacity and costs using a message queue to handle the load. You can learn more about our architecture in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture-1).

## Contributing

All code contributions, including those of people having commit access, must go through a pull request and be approved by a core developer before being merged. This is to ensure a proper review of all the code.

We truly :heart: pull requests! If you wish to help, you can learn more about how you can contribute to this project in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/diagram.png)

Suna consists of four main components:

### Backend API

Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration with Anthropic, and others via LiteLLM.

### Frontend

Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker

Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features.

### Supabase Database

Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions.

### [Read the docs →](https://zod.dev)

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

## What is Zod?

Zod is a TypeScript-first validation library. Define a schema and parse some data with it. You&#039;ll get back a strongly typed, validated result.

```ts
import { z } from &quot;zod/v4&quot;;

const User = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});

// some untrusted data...
const input = { /* stuff */ };

// the parsed result is validated and type safe!
const data = User.parse(input);

// so you can use it with confidence :)
console.log(data.name);
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Features

- Zero external dependencies
- Works in Node.js and all modern browsers
- Tiny: `2kb` core bundle (gzipped)
- Immutable API: methods return a new instance
- Concise interface
- Works with TypeScript and plain JS
- Built-in JSON Schema conversion
- Extensive ecosystem

&lt;br/&gt;

## Installation

```sh
npm install zod
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Basic usage

Before you can do anything else, you need to define a schema. For the purposes of this guide, we&#039;ll use a simple object schema.

```
import { z } from &quot;zod/v4&quot;; 

const Player = z.object({ 
  username: z.string(),
  xp: z.number()
});
```
 
### Parsing data

Given any Zod schema, use `.parse` to validate an input. If it&#039;s valid, Zod returns a strongly-typed *deep clone* of the input. 

```ts
Player.parse({ username: &quot;billie&quot;, xp: 100 }); 
// =&gt; returns { username: &quot;billie&quot;, xp: 100 }
```

**Note** — If your schema uses certain asynchronous APIs like `async` [refinements](#refine) or [transforms](#transform), you&#039;ll need to use the `.parseAsync()` method instead. 

```ts
const schema = z.string().refine(async (val) =&gt; val.length &lt;= 8);

await schema.parseAsync(&quot;hello&quot;);
// =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;
```

### Handling errors

When validation fails, the `.parse()` method will throw a `ZodError` instance with granular information about the validation issues.


```ts
try {
  Player.parse({ username: 42, xp: &quot;100&quot; });
} catch(err){
  if(error instanceof z.ZodError){
    err.issues; 
    /* [
      {
        expected: &#039;string&#039;,
        code: &#039;invalid_type&#039;,
        path: [ &#039;username&#039; ],
        message: &#039;Invalid input: expected string&#039;
      },
      {
        expected: &#039;number&#039;,
        code: &#039;invalid_type&#039;,
        path: [ &#039;xp&#039; ],
        message: &#039;Invalid input: expected number&#039;
      }
    ] */
  }
}
```

To avoid a `try/catch` block, you can use the `.safeParse()` method to get back a plain result object containing either the successfully parsed data or a `ZodError`. The result type is a [discriminated union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions), so you can handle both cases conveniently.

```ts
const result = Player.parse({ username: 42, xp: &quot;100&quot; });
if (!result.success) {
  result.error;   // ZodError instance
} else {
  result.data;    // { username: string; xp: number }
}
```

**Note** — If your schema uses certain asynchronous APIs like `async` [refinements](#refine) or [transforms](#transform), you&#039;ll need to use the `.safeParseAsync()` method instead. 

```ts
const schema = z.string().refine(async (val) =&gt; val.length &lt;= 8);

await schema.safeParseAsync(&quot;hello&quot;);
// =&gt; { success: true; data: &quot;hello&quot; }
```

### Inferring types

Zod infers a static type from your schema definitions. You can extract this type with the `z.infer&lt;&gt;` utility and use it however you like.

```ts
const Player = z.object({ 
  username: z.string(),
  xp: z.number()
});

// extract the inferred type
type Player = z.infer&lt;typeof Player&gt;;

// use it in your code
const player: Player = { username: &quot;billie&quot;, xp: 100 };
```

In some cases, the input &amp; output types of a schema can diverge. For instance, the `.transform()` API can convert the input from one type to another. In these cases, you can extract the input and output types independently:

```ts
const mySchema = z.string().transform((val) =&gt; val.length);

type MySchemaIn = z.input&lt;typeof mySchema&gt;;
// =&gt; string

type MySchemaOut = z.output&lt;typeof mySchema&gt;; // equivalent to z.infer&lt;typeof mySchema&gt;
// number
```

## Download

You can check out the [latest release](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music/releases/latest) to quickly find the
latest version.

### Arch Linux

Install the [`youtube-music-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/youtube-music-bin) package from the AUR. For AUR installation instructions, take a look at
this [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).

### macOS

You can install the app using Homebrew (see the [cask definition](https://github.com/th-ch/homebrew-youtube-music)):

```bash
brew install th-ch/youtube-music/youtube-music
```

If you install the app manually and get an error &quot;is damaged and can’t be opened.&quot; when launching the app, run the following in the Terminal:

```bash
/usr/bin/xattr -cr /Applications/YouTube\ Music.app
```

### Windows

You can use the [Scoop package manager](https://scoop.sh) to install the `youtube-music` package from
the [`extras` bucket](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras).

```bash
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/youtube-music
```

Alternately you can use [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/), Windows 11s
official CLI package manager to install the `th-ch.YouTubeMusic` package.

*Note: Microsoft Defender SmartScreen might block the installation since it is from an &quot;unknown publisher&quot;. This is also
true for the manual installation when trying to run the executable(.exe) after a manual download here on github (same
file).*

```bash
winget install th-ch.YouTubeMusic
```

#### How to install without a network connection? (in Windows)

- Download the `*.nsis.7z` file for _your device architecture_ in [release page](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music/releases/latest).
  - `x64` for 64-bit Windows
  - `ia32` for 32-bit Windows
  - `arm64` for ARM64 Windows
- Download installer in release page. (`*-Setup.exe`)
- Place them in the **same directory**.
- Run the installer.

## Themes

You can load CSS files to change the look of the application (Options &gt; Visual Tweaks &gt; Themes).

Some predefined themes are available in https://github.com/kerichdev/themes-for-ytmdesktop-player.

## Dev

```bash
git clone https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music
cd youtube-music
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

## Build your own plugins

Using plugins, you can:

- manipulate the app - the `BrowserWindow` from electron is passed to the plugin handler
- change the front by manipulating the HTML/CSS

### Creating a plugin

Create a folder in `src/plugins/YOUR-PLUGIN-NAME`:

- `index.ts`: the main file of the plugin
```typescript
import style from &#039;./style.css?inline&#039;; // import style as inline

import { createPlugin } from &#039;@/utils&#039;;

export default createPlugin({
  name: &#039;Plugin Label&#039;,
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic show restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  stylesheets: [style], // your custom style,
  menu: async ({ getConfig, setConfig }) =&gt; {
    // All *Config methods are wrapped Promise&lt;T&gt;
    const config = await getConfig();
    return [
      {
        label: &#039;menu&#039;,
        submenu: [1, 2, 3].map((value) =&gt; ({
          label: `value ${value}`,
          type: &#039;radio&#039;,
          checked: config.value === value,
          click() {
            setConfig({ value });
          },
        })),
      },
    ];
  },
  backend: {
    start({ window, ipc }) {
      window.maximize();

      // you can communicate with renderer plugin
      ipc.handle(&#039;some-event&#039;, () =&gt; {
        return &#039;hello&#039;;
      });
    },
    // it fired when config changed
    onConfigChange(newConfig) { /* ... */ },
    // it fired when plugin disabled
    stop(context) { /* ... */ },
  },
  renderer: {
    async start(context) {
      console.log(await context.ipc.invoke(&#039;some-event&#039;));
    },
    // Only renderer available hook
    onPlayerApiReady(api: YoutubePlayer, context: RendererContext) {
      // set plugin config easily
      context.setConfig({ myConfig: api.getVolume() });
    },
    onConfigChange(newConfig) { /* ... */ },
    stop(_context) { /* ... */ },
  },
  preload: {
    async start({ getConfig }) {
      const config = await getConfig();
    },
    onConfigChange(newConfig) {},
    stop(_context) {},
  },
});
```

### Common use cases

- injecting custom CSS: create a `style.css` file in the same folder then:

```typescript
// index.ts
import style from &#039;./style.css?inline&#039;; // import style as inline

import { createPlugin } from &#039;@/utils&#039;;

export default createPlugin({
  name: &#039;Plugin Label&#039;,
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic will show a restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  stylesheets: [style], // your custom style
  renderer() {} // define renderer hook
});
```

- If you want to change the HTML:

```typescript
import { createPlugin } from &#039;@/utils&#039;;

export default createPlugin({
  name: &#039;Plugin Label&#039;,
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic will show the restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  renderer() {
    // Remove the login button
    document.querySelector(&quot;.sign-in-link.ytmusic-nav-bar&quot;).remove();
  } // define renderer hook
});
```

- communicating between the front and back: can be done using the ipcMain module from electron. See `index.ts` file and
  example in `sponsorblock` plugin.

## FAQ

### Why apps menu isn&#039;t showing up?

If `Hide Menu` option is on - you can show the menu with the &lt;kbd&gt;alt&lt;/kbd&gt; key (or &lt;kbd&gt;\`&lt;/kbd&gt; [backtick] if using
the in-app-menu plugin)

&lt;br/&gt;

Give [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) and other AI-powered coding tools access to your Figma files with this [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server.

When Cursor has access to Figma design data, it&#039;s **way** better at one-shotting designs accurately than alternative approaches like pasting screenshots.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=readme&quot;&gt;See quickstart instructions →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6G9yb-LrEqg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6G9yb-LrEqg)

## How it works

1. Open your IDE&#039;s chat (e.g. agent mode in Cursor).
2. Paste a link to a Figma file, frame, or group.
3. Ask Cursor to do something with the Figma file—e.g. implement the design.
4. Cursor will fetch the relevant metadata from Figma and use it to write your code.

This MCP server is specifically designed for use with Cursor. Before responding with context from the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api), it simplifies and translates the response so only the most relevant layout and styling information is provided to the model.

Reducing the amount of context provided to the model helps make the AI more accurate and the responses more relevant.

## Getting Started

Many code editors and other AI clients use a configuration file to manage MCP servers.

The `figma-developer-mcp` server can be configured by adding the following to your configuration file.

&gt; NOTE: You will need to create a Figma access token to use this server. Instructions on how to create a Figma API access token can be found [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).

### MacOS / Linux

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;Framelink Figma MCP&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;figma-developer-mcp&quot;, &quot;--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY&quot;, &quot;--stdio&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;Framelink Figma MCP&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;cmd&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/c&quot;, &quot;npx&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;figma-developer-mcp&quot;, &quot;--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY&quot;, &quot;--stdio&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

Or you can set `FIGMA_API_KEY` and `PORT` in the `env` field.

If you need more information on how to configure the Framelink Figma MCP server, see the [Framelink docs](https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=readme).

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React is an excellent tool for building front-end applications. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture that developers can follow, it often leads to a messy, inconsistent, and over-complicated codebase.

This repo attempts to present a way of creating React applications using some of the best tools in the ecosystem with a good project structure that scales very well. Based on my experience working with a lot of different codebases, this architecture turns out to be the most effective.

The goal here is to serve as a collection of resources and best practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and help developers write better applications.

Feel free to explore the sample app codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

## What makes a React application &quot;bulletproof&quot;?

This repo doesn&#039;t aim to be a silver bullet for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.

To get most out of it, do not get limited by the technologies used in this sample app, but rather focus on the principles and the concepts that are being presented here. The tools and libraries used here are just a suggestion, you can always replace them with something that fits your needs better. Sometimes, your project might require a slightly different approach, and that&#039;s totally fine.

# Local Installation
1. Create a root folder for your project (e.g. &#039;maxun&#039;)
2. Create a file named `.env` in the root folder of the project
3. Example env file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/getmaxun/maxun/blob/master/ENVEXAMPLE). Copy all content of example env to your `.env` file.
4. Choose your installation method below

### Docker Compose
1. Copy paste the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/getmaxun/maxun/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) into your root folder 
2. Ensure you have setup the `.env` file in that same folder
3. Run the command below from a terminal
```
docker-compose up -d
```
You can access the frontend at http://localhost:5173/ and backend at http://localhost:8080/

### Without Docker
1. Ensure you have Node.js, PostgreSQL, MinIO and Redis installed on your system.
2. Run the commands below
```
git clone https://github.com/getmaxun/maxun

# change directory to the project root
cd maxun

# install dependencies
npm install

# change directory to maxun-core to install dependencies
cd maxun-core 
npm install

# get back to the root directory
cd ..

# install chromium and its dependencies
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# get back to the root directory
cd ..

# start frontend and backend together
npm run start
```
You can access the frontend at http://localhost:5173/ and backend at http://localhost:8080/

Maxun lets you create custom robots which emulate user actions and extract data. A robot can perform any of the actions: &lt;b&gt;Capture List, Capture Text or Capture Screenshot. Once a robot is created, it will keep extracting data for you without manual intervention&lt;/b&gt;

## 1. Robot Actions
1. Capture List: Useful to extract structured and bulk items from the website. Example: Scrape products from Amazon etc.
2. Capture Text: Useful to extract individual text content from the website.
3. Capture Screenshot: Get fullpage or visible section screenshots of the website.

## 2. BYOP
BYOP (Bring Your Own Proxy) lets you connect external proxies to bypass anti-bot protection. Currently, the proxies are per user. Soon you&#039;ll be able to configure proxy per robot.

## Evolution API

Evolution API began as a WhatsApp controller API based on [CodeChat](https://github.com/code-chat-br/whatsapp-api), which in turn implemented the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library. While originally focused on WhatsApp, Evolution API has grown into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple messaging services and integrations. We continue to acknowledge CodeChat for laying the groundwork.

Today, Evolution API is not limited to WhatsApp. It integrates with various platforms such as Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, and OpenAI, offering a broad array of functionalities beyond messaging. Evolution API supports both the Baileys-based WhatsApp API and the official WhatsApp Business API, with upcoming support for Instagram and Messenger.

## Looking for a Lightweight Version?
For those who need a more streamlined and performance-optimized version, check out [Evolution API Lite](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api-lite). It&#039;s designed specifically for microservices, focusing solely on connectivity without integrations or audio conversion features. Ideal for environments that prioritize simplicity and efficiency.

## Types of Connections

Evolution API supports multiple types of connections to WhatsApp, enabling flexible and powerful integration options:

- *WhatsApp API - Baileys*:
  - A free API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).
  - This connection type allows control over WhatsApp Web functionalities through a RESTful API, suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, and other WhatsApp-integrated systems.
  - Note: This method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.

- *WhatsApp Cloud API*:
  - The official API provided by Meta (formerly Facebook).
  - This connection type offers a robust and reliable solution designed for businesses needing higher volumes of messaging and better integration support.
  - The Cloud API supports features such as end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive customer service tools.
  - To use this API, you must comply with Meta&#039;s policies and potentially pay for usage based on message volume and other factors.

## Integrations

Evolution API supports various integrations to enhance its functionality. Below is a list of available integrations and their uses:

- [Typebot](https://typebot.io/):
  - Build conversational bots using Typebot, integrated directly into Evolution with trigger management.

- [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/):
  - Direct integration with Chatwoot for handling customer service for your business.

- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/):
  - Receive events from the Evolution API via RabbitMQ.

- [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/sqs/):
  - Receive events from the Evolution API via Amazon SQS.

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/):
  - Receive events from the Evolution API via WebSocket.

- [Dify](https://dify.ai/):
  - Integrate your Evolution API directly with Dify AI for seamless trigger management and multiple agents.

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/):
  - Integrate your Evolution API with OpenAI for AI capabilities, including audio-to-text conversion, available across all Evolution integrations.

- Amazon S3 / Minio:
  - Store media files received in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/) or [Minio](https://min.io/).

## Telemetry Notice

To continuously improve our services, we have implemented telemetry that collects data on the routes used, the most accessed routes, and the version of the API in use. We would like to assure you that no sensitive or personal data is collected during this process. The telemetry helps us identify improvements and provide a better experience for users.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [SiYuan development plan and progress](https://github.com/orgs/siyuan-note/projects/1)
* [SiYuan changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## 🚀 Download Setup

It is recommended to give priority to installing through the application market on the desktop and mobile, so that you can upgrade the version with one click in the future.

### App Market

Mobile:

* [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/siyuan/id1583226508)
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.b3log.siyuan)
* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.b3log.siyuan)

Desktop:

* [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p7hpmxp73k4)

### Installation Package

* [B3log](https://b3log.org/siyuan/en/download.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan/releases)

### Docker Hosting

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Docker Deployment&lt;/summary&gt;

#### Overview

The easiest way to serve SiYuan on a server is to deploy it through Docker.

* Image name `b3log/siyuan`
* [Image URL](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3log/siyuan)

#### File structure

The overall program is located under `/opt/siyuan/`, which is basically the structure under the resources folder of the Electron installation package:

* appearance: icon, theme, languages
* guide: user guide document
* stage: interface and static resources
* kernel: kernel program

#### Entrypoint

The entry point is set when building the Docker image: `ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/opt/siyuan/entrypoint.sh&quot;]`. This script allows changing the `PUID` and `PGID` of the user that will run inside the container. This is especially relevant to solve permission issues when mounting directories from the host. The `PUID` (User ID) and `PGID` (Group ID) can be passed as environment variables, making it easier to ensure correct permissions when accessing host-mounted directories.

Use the following parameters when running the container with `docker run b3log/siyuan`:

* `--workspace`: Specifies the workspace folder path, mounted to the container via `-v` on the host
* `--accessAuthCode`: Specifies the access authorization code

More parameters can be found using `--help`. Here’s an example of a startup command with the new environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v workspace_dir_host:workspace_dir_container \
  -p 6806:6806 \
  -e PUID=1001 -e PGID=1002 \
  b3log/siyuan \
  --workspace=workspace_dir_container \
  --accessAuthCode=xxx
```

* `PUID`: Custom user ID (optional, defaults to `1000` if not provided)
* `PGID`: Custom group ID (optional, defaults to `1000` if not provided)
* `workspace_dir_host`: The workspace folder path on the host
* `workspace_dir_container`: The path of the workspace folder in the container, as specified in `--workspace`
  * In alternative, it&#039;s possible to set the path via the `SIYUAN_WORKSPACE_PATH` env variable. The commandline will always have the priority, if both are set.
* `accessAuthCode`: Access authorization code (please **be sure to modify**, otherwise anyone can access your data)
  * In alternative, it&#039;s possible to set the auth code via the `SIYUAN_ACCESS_AUTH_CODE` env variable. The commandline will always have the priority, if both are set.

To simplify things, it is recommended to configure the workspace folder path to be consistent on the host and container, such as having both `workspace_dir_host` and `workspace_dir_container` configured as `/siyuan/workspace`. The corresponding startup command would be:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace \
  -p 6806:6806 \
  -e PUID=1001 -e PGID=1002 \
  b3log/siyuan \
  --workspace=/siyuan/workspace/ \
  --accessAuthCode=xxx
```

#### Docker Compose

For users running Siyuan with Docker Compose, the environment variables `PUID` and `PGID` can be passed to customize the user and group IDs. Here&#039;s an example of a Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml
version: &quot;3.9&quot;
services:
  main:
    image: b3log/siyuan
    command: [&#039;--workspace=/siyuan/workspace/&#039;, &#039;--accessAuthCode=${AuthCode}&#039;]
    ports:
      - 6806:6806
    volumes:
      - /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # A list of time zone identifiers can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
      - TZ=${YOUR_TIME_ZONE}
      - PUID=${YOUR_USER_PUID}  # Customize user ID
      - PGID=${YOUR_USER_PGID}  # Customize group ID
```

In this setup:

* `PUID` and `PGID` are set dynamically and passed to the container
* If these variables are not provided, the default `1000` will be used

By specifying `PUID` and `PGID` in the environment, you avoid the need to explicitly set the `user` directive (`user: &#039;1000:1000&#039;`) in the compose file. The container will dynamically adjust the user and group based on these environment variables at startup.

#### User Permissions

In the image, the `entrypoint.sh` script ensures the creation of the `siyuan` user and group with the specified `PUID` and `PGID`. Therefore, when the host creates a workspace folder, pay attention to setting the user and group ownership of the folder to match the `PUID` and `PGID` you plan to use. For example:

```bash
chown -R 1001:1002 /siyuan/workspace
```

If you use custom `PUID` and `PGID` values, the entrypoint script will ensure that the correct user and group are created inside the container, and ownership of mounted volumes will be adjusted accordingly. There’s no need to manually pass `-u` in `docker run` or `docker-compose` as the environment variables will handle the customization.

#### Hidden port

Use NGINX reverse proxy to hide port 6806, please note:

* Configure WebSocket reverse proxy `/ws`

#### Note

* Be sure to confirm the correctness of the mounted volume, otherwise the data will be lost after the container is deleted
* Do not use URL rewriting for redirection, otherwise there may be problems with authentication, it is recommended to configure a reverse proxy
* If you encounter permission issues, verify that the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables match the ownership of the mounted directories on your host system

#### Limitations

* Does not support desktop and mobile application connections, only supports use on browsers
* Export to PDF, HTML and Word formats is not supported
* Import Markdown file is not supported

&lt;/details&gt;

### Unraid Hosting

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Unraid Deployment&lt;/summary&gt;

Note: First run `chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/user/appdata/siyuan` in the terminal

Template reference:

```
Web UI: 6806
Container Port: 6806
Container Path: /home/siyuan
Host path: /mnt/user/appdata/siyuan
PUID: 1000
PGID: 1000
Publish parameters: --accessAuthCode=******(Access authorization code)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

* The rest of the folders are the notebook folders created by the user, files with the suffix of `.sy` in the notebook folder are used to save the document data, and the data format is JSON

### Does it support data synchronization through a third-party sync disk?

Data synchronization through third-party synchronization disks is not supported, otherwise data may be corrupted.

Although it does not support third-party sync disks, it supports connect with third-party cloud storage (Member&#039;s privileges).

In addition, you can also consider manually exporting and importing data to achieve data synchronization:

* Desktop: &lt;kbd&gt;Settings&lt;/kbd&gt; - &lt;kbd&gt;Export&lt;/kbd&gt; - &lt;kbd&gt;Export Data&lt;/kbd&gt; / &lt;kbd&gt;Import Data&lt;/kbd&gt;
* Mobile: &lt;kbd&gt;Right column&lt;/kbd&gt; - &lt;kbd&gt;About&lt;/kbd&gt; - &lt;kbd&gt;Export Data&lt;/kbd&gt; / &lt;kbd&gt;Import Data&lt;/kbd&gt;

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

docker run -d -p 80:80 \
  -e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name prompt-optimizer \
  linshen/prompt-optimizer
```

### 5. Docker Compose部署
```bash
# 1. 克隆仓库
git clone https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer.git
cd prompt-optimizer

# 2. 可选：创建.env文件配置API密钥
cat &gt; .env &lt;&lt; EOF
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
EOF

# 3. 启动服务
docker compose up -d

# 4. 查看日志
docker compose logs -f
```

你还可以直接编辑docker-compose.yml文件，自定义配置：
```yaml
services:
  prompt-optimizer:
    image: linshen/prompt-optimizer:latest
    container_name: prompt-optimizer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &quot;8081:80&quot;  # 修改端口映射
    environment:
      - VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here  # 直接在配置中设置密钥
```

## ⚙️ API密钥配置

### 方式一：通过界面配置（推荐）
1. 点击界面右上角的&quot;⚙️设置&quot;按钮
2. 选择&quot;模型管理&quot;选项卡
3. 点击需要配置的模型（如OpenAI、Gemini、DeepSeek等）
4. 在弹出的配置框中输入对应的API密钥
5. 点击&quot;保存&quot;即可

支持的模型：
- OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
- Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash)
- DeepSeek (DeepSeek-V3)
- 自定义API（OpenAI兼容接口）

### 方式二：通过环境变量配置
Docker部署时通过 `-e` 参数配置环境变量：
```bash
-e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_SILICONFLOW_API_KEY=your_key
-e VITE_CUSTOM_API_KEY=your_custom_api_key
-e VITE_CUSTOM_API_BASE_URL=your_custom_api_base_url
-e VITE_CUSTOM_API_MODEL=your_custom_model_name 
```

## 常见问题

### API连接问题

#### Q1: 为什么配置好API密钥后仍然无法连接到模型服务？
**A**: 大多数连接失败是由**跨域问题**（CORS）导致的。由于本项目是纯前端应用，浏览器出于安全考虑会阻止直接访问不同源的API服务。模型服务如未正确配置CORS策略，会拒绝来自浏览器的直接请求。

#### Q2: 如何解决本地Ollama的连接问题？
**A**: Ollama完全支持OpenAI标准接口，只需配置正确的跨域策略：
1. 设置环境变量 `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` 允许任意来源的请求
2. 如仍有问题，设置 `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` 监听任意IP地址

#### Q3: 如何解决商业API（如Nvidia的DS API、字节跳动的火山API）的跨域问题？
**A**: 这些平台通常有严格的跨域限制，推荐以下解决方案：

1. **使用Vercel代理**（便捷方案）
   - 使用在线版本：[prompt.always200.com](https://prompt.always200.com)
   - 或自行部署到Vercel平台
   - 在模型设置中勾选&quot;使用Vercel代理&quot;选项
   - 请求流向：浏览器→Vercel→模型服务提供商
   - 详细步骤请参考 [Vercel部署指南](docs/vercel.md)

2. **使用自部署的API中转服务**（可靠方案）
   - 部署如OneAPI等开源API聚合/代理工具
   - 在设置中配置为自定义API端点
   - 请求流向：浏览器→中转服务→模型服务提供商

#### Q4: Vercel代理有什么缺点或风险？
**A**: 使用Vercel代理可能会触发某些模型服务提供商的风控机制。部分厂商可能会将来自Vercel的请求判定为代理行为，从而限制或拒绝服务。如遇此问题，建议使用自部署的中转服务。

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Realtime API Agents Demo

This is a simple demonstration of more advanced, agentic patterns built on top of the Realtime API. In particular, this demonstrates:
- Sequential agent handoffs according to a defined agent graph (taking inspiration from [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm))
- Background escalation to more intelligent models like o4-mini for high-stakes decisions
- Prompting models to follow a state machine, for example to accurately collect things like names and phone numbers with confirmation character by character to authenticate a user.

Here&#039;s a quick [demo video](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1880306081517432936) if you&#039;d like a walkthrough. You should be able to use this repo to prototype your own multi-agent realtime voice app in less than 20 minutes!

![Screenshot of the Realtime API Agents Demo](/public/screenshot.png)

## Setup

- This is a Next.js typescript app
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your env. Either add it to your `.bash_profile` or equivalent file, or copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and add it there.
- Start the server with `npm run dev`
- Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app. It should automatically connect to the `simpleExample` Agent Set.

## Configuring Agents
Configuration in `src/app/agentConfigs/simpleExample.ts`
```javascript
import { AgentConfig } from &quot;@/app/types&quot;;
import { injectTransferTools } from &quot;./utils&quot;;

// Define agents
const haikuWriter: AgentConfig = {
  name: &quot;haikuWriter&quot;,
  publicDescription: &quot;Agent that writes haikus.&quot;, // Context for the agent_transfer tool
  instructions:
    &quot;Ask the user for a topic, then reply with a haiku about that topic.&quot;,
  tools: [],
};

const greeter: AgentConfig = {
  name: &quot;greeter&quot;,
  publicDescription: &quot;Agent that greets the user.&quot;,
  instructions:
    &quot;Please greet the user and ask them if they&#039;d like a Haiku. If yes, transfer them to the &#039;haiku&#039; agent.&quot;,
  tools: [],
  downstreamAgents: [haikuWriter],
};

// add the transfer tool to point to downstreamAgents
const agents = injectTransferTools([greeter, haikuWriter]);

export default agents;
```

This fully specifies the agent set that was used in the interaction shown in the screenshot above.

This diagram illustrates the interaction flow defined in `src/app/agentConfigs/customerServiceRetail/`.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show CustomerServiceRetail Flow Diagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WebClient as Next.js Client
    participant NextAPI as /api/session
    participant RealtimeAPI as OpenAI Realtime API
    participant AgentManager as Agents (authentication, returns, sales, simulatedHuman)
    participant o1mini as &quot;o4-mini&quot; (Escalation Model)

    Note over WebClient: User navigates to ?agentConfig=customerServiceRetail
    User-&gt;&gt;WebClient: Open Page
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;NextAPI: GET /api/session
    NextAPI-&gt;&gt;RealtimeAPI: POST /v1/realtime/sessions
    RealtimeAPI-&gt;&gt;NextAPI: Returns ephemeral session
    NextAPI-&gt;&gt;WebClient: Returns ephemeral token (JSON)

    Note right of WebClient: Start RTC handshake
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;RealtimeAPI: Offer SDP (WebRTC)
    RealtimeAPI-&gt;&gt;WebClient: SDP answer
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;WebClient: DataChannel &quot;oai-events&quot; established

    Note over AgentManager: Default agent is &quot;authentication&quot;
    User-&gt;&gt;WebClient: &quot;Hi, I&#039;d like to return my snowboard.&quot;
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;AgentManager: conversation.item.create (role=user)
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;RealtimeAPI: {type: &quot;conversation.item.create&quot;}
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;RealtimeAPI: {type: &quot;response.create&quot;}

    authentication-&gt;&gt;AgentManager: Requests user info, calls authenticate_user_information()
    AgentManager--&gt;&gt;WebClient: function_call =&gt; name=&quot;authenticate_user_information&quot;
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;WebClient: handleFunctionCall =&gt; verifies details

    Note over AgentManager: After user is authenticated
    authentication-&gt;&gt;AgentManager: transferAgents(&quot;returns&quot;)
    AgentManager--&gt;&gt;WebClient: function_call =&gt; name=&quot;transferAgents&quot; args={ destination: &quot;returns&quot; }
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;WebClient: setSelectedAgentName(&quot;returns&quot;)

    Note over returns: The user wants to process a return
    returns-&gt;&gt;AgentManager: function_call =&gt; checkEligibilityAndPossiblyInitiateReturn
    AgentManager--&gt;&gt;WebClient: function_call =&gt; name=&quot;checkEligibilityAndPossiblyInitiateReturn&quot;

    Note over WebClient: The WebClient calls /api/chat/completions with model=&quot;o4-mini&quot;
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;o1mini: &quot;Is this item eligible for return?&quot;
    o1mini-&gt;&gt;WebClient: &quot;Yes/No (plus notes)&quot;

    Note right of returns: Returns uses the result from &quot;o4-mini&quot;
    returns-&gt;&gt;AgentManager: &quot;Return is approved&quot; or &quot;Return is denied&quot;
    AgentManager-&gt;&gt;WebClient: conversation.item.create (assistant role)
    WebClient-&gt;&gt;User: Displays final verdict
```

&lt;/details&gt;


### Next steps
- Check out the configs in `src/app/agentConfigs`. The example above is a minimal demo that illustrates the core concepts.
- [frontDeskAuthentication](src/app/agentConfigs/frontDeskAuthentication) Guides the user through a step-by-step authentication flow, confirming each value character-by-character, authenticates the user with a tool call, and then transfers to another agent. Note that the second agent is intentionally &quot;bored&quot; to show how to prompt for personality and tone.
- [customerServiceRetail](src/app/agentConfigs/customerServiceRetail) Also guides through an authentication flow, reads a long offer from a canned script verbatim, and then walks through a complex return flow which requires looking up orders and policies, gathering user context, and checking with `o4-mini` to ensure the return is eligible. To test this flow, say that you&#039;d like to return your snowboard and go through the necessary prompts!

### Defining your own agents
- You can copy these to make your own multi-agent voice app! Once you make a new agent set config, add it to `src/app/agentConfigs/index.ts` and you should be able to select it in the UI in the &quot;Scenario&quot; dropdown menu.
- To see how to define tools and toolLogic, including a background LLM call, see [src/app/agentConfigs/customerServiceRetail/returns.ts](src/app/agentConfigs/customerServiceRetail/returns.ts)
- To see how to define a detailed personality and tone, and use a prompt state machine to collect user information step by step, see [src/app/agentConfigs/frontDeskAuthentication/authentication.ts](src/app/agentConfigs/frontDeskAuthentication/authentication.ts)
- To see how to wire up Agents into a single Agent Set, see [src/app/agentConfigs/frontDeskAuthentication/index.ts](src/app/agentConfigs/frontDeskAuthentication/index.ts)
- If you want help creating your own prompt using these conventions, we&#039;ve included a metaprompt [here](src/app/agentConfigs/voiceAgentMetaprompt.txt), or you can use our [Voice Agent Metaprompter GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-678865c9fb5c81918fa28699735dd08e-voice-agent-metaprompt-gpt)

### Customizing Output Guardrails
Assistant messages are checked for safety and compliance using a guardrail function before being finalized in the transcript. This is implemented in [`src/app/hooks/useHandleServerEvent.ts`](src/app/hooks/useHandleServerEvent.ts) as the `processGuardrail` function, which is invoked on each assistant message to run a moderation/classification check. You can review or customize this logic by editing the `processGuardrail` function definition and its invocation inside `useHandleServerEvent`.

## UI
- You can select agent scenarios in the Scenario dropdown, and automatically switch to a specific agent with the Agent dropdown.
- The conversation transcript is on the left, including tool calls, tool call responses, and agent changes. Click to expand non-message elements.
- The event log is on the right, showing both client and server events. Click to see the full payload.
- On the bottom, you can disconnect, toggle between automated voice-activity detection or PTT, turn off audio playback, and toggle logs.
