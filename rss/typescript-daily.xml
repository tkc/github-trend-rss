## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

- [04-23-2025] Data Formulator 0.2: working with *large* data 📦📦📦
  - Explore large data by:
    1. Upload large data file to the local database (powered by [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb)).
    2. Use drag-and-drop to specify charts, and Data Formulator dynamically fetches data from the database to create visualizations (with ⚡️⚡️⚡️ speeds).
    3. Work with AI agents: they generate SQL queries to transform the data to create rich visualizations!
    4. Anchor the result / follow up / create a new branch / join tables; let&#039;s dive deeper. 
  - Checkout the demos at [[https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.2]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.2)
  - Improved overall system performance, and enjoy the updated derive concept functionality.

- [03-20-2025] Data Formulator 0.1.7: Anchoring ⚓︎
  - Anchor an intermediate dataset, so that followup data analysis are built on top of the anchored data, not the original one.
  - Clean a data and work with only the cleaned data; create a subset from the original data or join multiple data, and then go from there. AI agents will be less likely to get confused and work faster. ⚡️⚡️
  - Check out the demos at [[https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.1.7]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.1.7)
  - Don&#039;t forget to update Data Formulator to test it out!

- [02-20-2025] Data Formulator 0.1.6 released! 
  - Now supports working with multiple datasets at once! Tell Data Formulator which data tables you would like to use in the encoding shelf, and it will figure out how to join the tables to create a visualization to answer your question. 🪄
  - Checkout the demo at [[https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.1.6]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.1.6).
  - Update your Data Formulator to the latest version to play with the new features.

- [02-12-2025] More models supported now!
  - Now supports OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, and Anthropic models (and more powered by [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm));
  - Models with strong code generation and instruction following capabilities are recommended (gpt-4o, claude-3-5-sonnet etc.);
  - You can store API keys in `api-keys.env` to avoid typing them every time (see template `api-keys.env.template`).
  - Let us know which models you have good/bad experiences with, and what models you would like to see supported! [[comment here]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/issues/49)

- [11-07-2024] Minor fun update: data visualization challenges!

## Overview

**Data Formulator** is an application from Microsoft Research that uses large language models to transform data, expediting the practice of data visualization.

Data Formulator is an AI-powered tool for analysts to iteratively create rich visualizations. Unlike most chat-based AI tools where users need to describe everything in natural language, Data Formulator combines *user interface interactions (UI)* and *natural language (NL) inputs* for easier interaction. This blended approach makes it easier for users to describe their chart designs while delegating data transformation to AI. 

## Get Started

Play with Data Formulator with one of the following options:

- **Option 1: Install via Python PIP**
  
  Use Python PIP for an easy setup experience, running locally (recommend: install it in a virtual environment).
  
  ```bash
  # install data_formulator
  pip install data_formulator

  # start data_formulator
  data_formulator 
  
  # alternatively, you can run data formulator with this command
  python -m data_formulator
  ```

  Data Formulator will be automatically opened in the browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

  *Update: you can specify the port number (e.g., 8080) by `python -m data_formulator --port 8080` if the default port is occupied.*

- **Option 2: Codespaces (5 minutes)**
  
  You can also run Data Formulator in Codespaces; we have everything pre-configured. For more details, see [CODESPACES.md](CODESPACES.md).
  
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/data-formulator?quickstart=1)

- **Option 3: Working in the developer mode**
  
  You can build Data Formulator locally if you prefer full control over your development environment and the ability to customize the setup to your specific needs. For detailed instructions, refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Once you&#039;ve completed the setup using either option, follow these steps to start using Data Formulator:

### The basics of data visualization
* Provide OpenAI keys and select a model (GPT-4o suggested) and choose a dataset.
* Choose a chart type, and then drag-and-drop data fields to chart properties (x, y, color, ...) to specify visual encodings.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fbea012-1d2d-46c3-a923-b1fc5eb5e5b8


### Create visualization beyond the initial dataset (powered by 🤖)
* You can type names of **fields that do not exist in current data** in the encoding shelf:
    - this tells Data Formulator that you want to create visualizations that require computation or transformation from existing data,
    - you can optionally provide a natural language prompt to explain and clarify your intent (not necessary when field names are self-explanatory).
* Click the **Formulate** button.
    - Data Formulator will transform data and instantiate the visualization based on the encoding and prompt.
* Inspect the data, chart and code.
* To create a new chart based on existing ones, follow up in natural language:
    - provide a follow up prompt (e.g., *``show only top 5!&#039;&#039;*),
    - you may also update visual encodings for the new chart.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93b3e84-8ca8-49ae-80ea-f91ceef34acb

Repeat this process as needed to explore and understand your data. Your explorations are trackable in the **Data Threads** panel. 

## Developers&#039; Guide

Follow the [developers&#039; instructions](DEVELOPMENT.md) to build your new data analysis tools on top of Data Formulator.

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Let AI build multi-agent workflows for you in minutes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

[Quickstart](#quick-start) | [Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/rxB8pzHxaS) | [Website](https://www.rowboatlabs.com/) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@RowBoatLabs) 

&lt;/h5&gt;

- ✨ **Start from an idea -&gt; copilot builds your multi-agent workflows**
   - E.g. &quot;Build me an assistant for a food delivery company to handle delivery status and missing items. Include the necessary tools.&quot;
- 🌐 **Connect MCP servers**
   - Add the MCP servers in settings -&gt; import the tools into Rowboat.     
- 📞 **Integrate into your app using the HTTP API or Python SDK**
   - Grab the project ID and generated API key from settings and use the API.

Powered by OpenAI&#039;s Agents SDK, Rowboat is the fastest way to build multi-agents!

## Quick start
1. Set your OpenAI key
      ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```
      
2. Clone the repository and start Rowboat
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rowboatlabs/rowboat.git
   cd rowboat
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Note: We have added native RAG support including file-uploads and URL scraping. See the [RAG](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_rag) section of our docs for this.

Note: See the [Using custom LLM providers](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/setup/#using-custom-llm-providers) section of our docs for using custom providers like OpenRouter and LiteLLM.

## Demo

#### Create a multi-agent assistant with MCP tools by chatting with Rowboat
[![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 00 25 31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a41622-8e0e-459f-becb-767503489866)](https://youtu.be/YRTCw9UHRbU)

## Integrate with Rowboat agents

There are 2 ways to integrate with the agents you create in Rowboat

1. HTTP API
   - You can use the API directly at [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/)
   - See [API Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_api/) for details
   ```bash
   curl --location &#039;http://localhost:3000/api/v1/&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;/chat&#039; \
   --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
   --header &#039;Authorization: Bearer &lt;API_KEY&gt;&#039; \
   --data &#039;{
       &quot;messages&quot;: [
           {
               &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
               &quot;content&quot;: &quot;tell me the weather in london in metric units&quot;
           }
       ],
       &quot;state&quot;: null
   }&#039;
   ```
   

2. Python SDK
   You can use the included Python SDK to interact with the Agents
   ```
   pip install rowboat
   ```

   See [SDK Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_sdk/) for details. Here is a quick example:
   ```python
   from rowboat import Client, StatefulChat
   from rowboat.schema import UserMessage, SystemMessage

   # Initialize the client
   client = Client(
       host=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
       project_id=&quot;&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;&quot;,
       api_key=&quot;&lt;API_KEY&gt;&quot;
   )

   # Create a stateful chat session (recommended)
   chat = StatefulChat(client)
   response = chat.run(&quot;What&#039;s the weather in London?&quot;)
   print(response)

   # Or use the low-level client API
   messages = [
       SystemMessage(role=&#039;system&#039;, content=&quot;You are a helpful assistant&quot;),
       UserMessage(role=&#039;user&#039;, content=&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;)
   ]
   
   # Get response
   response = client.chat(messages=messages)
   print(response.messages[-1].content)
   ```

&lt;img width=&quot;64&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/Assets/LinuxIcons/256x256.png&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt; **Joplin** is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in [Markdown format](#markdown).

Notes exported from Evernote via .enex files [can be imported](#importing) into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to Markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.). Plain Markdown files can also be imported.

The notes can be [synchronised](#synchronisation) with various cloud services including [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV or the file system (for example with a network directory). When synchronising the notes, notebooks, tags and other metadata are saved to plain text files which can be easily inspected, backed up and moved around.

The application is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS (the terminal app also works on FreeBSD). A [Web Clipper](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/master/readme/clipper.md), to save web pages and screenshots from your browser, is also available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/joplin-web-clipper/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/joplin-web-clipper/alofnhikmmkdbbbgpnglcpdollgjjfek?hl=en-GB).

# Installation

Three types of applications are available: for the **desktop** (Windows, macOS and Linux), for **mobile** (Android and iOS) and for **terminal** (Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD). All applications have similar user interfaces and can synchronise with each other.

## Desktop applications

Operating System | Download | Alternative
-----------------|--------|-------------------
Windows (32 and 64-bit)         | &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/download/v1.0.241/Joplin-Setup-1.0.241.exe&#039;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#039;Get it on Windows&#039; width=&quot;134px&quot; src=&#039;https://joplinapp.org/images/BadgeWindows.png&#039;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | Or get the &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/download/v1.0.241/JoplinPortable.exe&#039;&gt;Portable version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The [portable application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application) allows installing the software on a portable device such as a USB key. Simply copy the file JoplinPortable.exe in any directory on that USB key ; the application will then create a directory called &quot;JoplinProfile&quot; next to the executable file.
macOS          | &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/download/v1.0.241/Joplin-1.0.241.dmg&#039;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#039;Get it on macOS&#039; width=&quot;134px&quot; src=&#039;https://joplinapp.org/images/BadgeMacOS.png&#039;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | You can also use Homebrew (unsupported): `brew cask install joplin`
Linux          | &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/download/v1.0.241/Joplin-1.0.241.AppImage&#039;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#039;Get it on Linux&#039; width=&quot;134px&quot; src=&#039;https://joplinapp.org/images/BadgeLinux.png&#039;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | An Arch Linux package (unsupported) [is also available](#terminal-application).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it works with your distribution (it has been tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Mint; the desktop environments supported are GNOME, KDE, Xfce, MATE, LXQT, LXDE, Unity, Cinnamon, Deepin and Pantheon), the recommended way is to use this script as it will handle the desktop icon too:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; `wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/Joplin_install_and_update.sh \| bash`

## Terminal application

Operating system | Method
-----------------|----------------
macOS, Linux, or Windows (via [WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/faq?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396)) | **Important:** First, [install Node 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;`NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.joplin-bin npm install -g joplin`&lt;br/&gt;`sudo ln -s ~/.joplin-bin/bin/joplin /usr/bin/joplin`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By default, the application binary will be installed under `~/.joplin-bin`. You may change this directory if needed. Alternatively, if your npm permissions are setup as described [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-2-change-npms-default-directory-to-another-directory) (Option 2) then simply running `npm -g install joplin` would work.

To start it, type `joplin`.

For usage information, please refer to the full [Joplin Terminal Application Documentation](https://joplinapp.org/terminal/).

### Unsupported methods

There are other ways to install the terminal application. However, they are not supported and problems must be reported to the upstream projects.

Operating system | Method
-----------------|----------------
macOS            | `brew install joplin`
Arch Linux       | An Arch Linux package is available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/joplin/). To install it, use an AUR wrapper such as yay: `yay -S joplin`. Both the CLI tool (type `joplin`) and desktop app (type `joplin-desktop`) are packaged. You can also install a compiled version with the [chaotic-aur](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#chaotic-aur) repository. For support, please go to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/masterkorp/joplin-pkgbuild).

## Web Clipper

The Web Clipper is a browser extension that allows you to save web pages and screenshots from your browser. For more information on how to install and use it, see the [Web Clipper Help Page](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/master/readme/clipper.md).

# Importing

## Importing from Evernote

Joplin was designed as a replacement for Evernote and so can import complete Evernote notebooks, as well as notes, tags, resources (attached files) and note metadata (such as author, geo-location, etc.) via ENEX files. In terms of data, the only two things that might slightly differ are:

- Recognition data - Evernote images, in particular scanned (or photographed) documents have [recognition data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) associated with them. It is the text that Evernote has been able to recognise in the document. This data is not preserved when the note are imported into Joplin. However, should it become supported in the search tool or other parts of Joplin, it should be possible to regenerate this recognition data since the actual image would still be available.

- Colour, font sizes and faces - Evernote text is stored as HTML and this is converted to Markdown during the import process. For notes that are mostly plain text or with basic formatting (bold, italic, bullet points, links, etc.) this is a lossless conversion, and the note, once rendered back to HTML should be very similar. Tables are also imported and converted to Markdown tables. For very complex notes, some formatting data might be lost - in particular colours, font sizes and font faces will not be imported. The text itself however is always imported in full regardless of formatting.

To import Evernote data, first export your Evernote notebooks to ENEX files as described [here](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-How-to-back-up-export-and-restore-import-notes-and-notebooks). Then follow these steps:

In the **desktop application**, open File &gt; Import &gt; ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc.

In the **terminal application**, in [command-line mode](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/master/readme/terminal.md#command-line-mode), type `import /path/to/file.enex`. This will import the notes into a new notebook named after the filename.

## Importing from Markdown files

Joplin can import notes from plain Markdown file. You can either import a complete directory of Markdown files or individual files.

In the **desktop application**, open File &gt; Import &gt; MD and select your Markdown file or directory.

In the **terminal application**, in [command-line mode](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/master/readme/terminal.md#command-line-mode), type `import --format md /path/to/file.md` or `import --format md /path/to/directory/`.

## Importing from other applications

In general the way to import notes from any application into Joplin is to convert the notes to ENEX files (Evernote format) and to import these ENEX files into Joplin using the method above. Most note-taking applications support ENEX files so it should be relatively straightforward. For help about specific applications, see below:

* Standard Notes: Please see [this tutorial](https://programadorwebvalencia.com/migrate-notes-from-standard-notes-to-joplin/)
* Tomboy Notes: Export the notes to ENEX files [as described here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/243691/how-can-i-export-my-tomboy-notes-into-evernote/608551) for example, and import these ENEX files into Joplin.
* OneNote: First [import the notes from OneNote into Evernote](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/107736-is-there-a-way-to-import-from-onenote-into-evernote-on-the-mac/). Then export the ENEX file from Evernote and import it into Joplin.
* NixNote: Synchronise with Evernote, then export the ENEX files and import them into Joplin. More info [in this thread](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/import-from-nixnote/183/3).

# Exporting

Joplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is a tar file that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a lossless format in that all the notes, but also metadata such as geo-location, updated time, tags, etc. are preserved. This format is convenient for backup purposes and can be re-imported into Joplin. A &quot;raw&quot; format is also available. This is the same as the JEX format except that the data is saved to a directory and each item represented by a single file.

# Synchronisation

One of the goals of Joplin was to avoid being tied to any particular company or service, whether it is Evernote, Google or Microsoft. As such the synchronisation is designed without any hard dependency to any particular service. Most of the synchronisation process is done at an abstract level and access to external services, such as Nextcloud or Dropbox, is done via lightweight drivers. It is easy to support new services by creating simple drivers that provide a filesystem-like interface, i.e. the ability to read, write, delete and list items. It is also simple to switch from one service to another or to even sync to multiple services at once. Each note, notebook, tags, as well as the relation between items is transmitted as plain text files during synchronisation, which means the data can also be moved to a different application, can be easily backed up, inspected, etc.

Currently, synchronisation is possible with Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem. To enable synchronisation please follow the instructions below. After that, the application will synchronise in the background whenever it is running, or you can click on &quot;Synchronise&quot; to start a synchronisation manually.

## Nextcloud synchronisation

&lt;img src=&quot;https://joplinapp.org/images/nextcloud-logo-background.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com/&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt; is a self-hosted, private cloud solution. It can store documents, images and videos but also calendars, passwords and countless other things and can sync them to your laptop or phone. As you can host your own Nextcloud server, you own both the data on your device and infrastructure used for synchronisation. As such it is a good fit for Joplin. The platform is also well supported and with a strong community, so it is likely to be around for a while - since it&#039;s open source anyway, it is not a service that can be closed, it can exist on a server for as long as one chooses.

In the **desktop application** or **mobile application**, go to the config screen and select Nextcloud as the synchronisation target. Then input the WebDAV URL (to get it, click on Settings in the bottom left corner of the page, in Nextcloud), this is normally `https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin` (**make sure to create the &quot;Joplin&quot; directory in Nextcloud**), and set the username and password. If it does not work, please [see this explanation](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/61#issuecomment-373282608) for more details.

In the **terminal application**, you will need to set the `sync.target` config variable and all the `sync.5.path`, `sync.5.username` and `sync.5.password` config variables to, respectively the Nextcloud WebDAV URL, your username and your password. This can be done from the command line mode using:

	:config sync.5.path https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin
	:config sync.5.username YOUR_USERNAME
	:config sync.5.password YOUR_PASSWORD
	:config sync.target 5

If synchronisation does not work, please consult the logs in the app profile directory - it is often due to a misconfigured URL or password. The log should indicate what the exact issue is.

## Dropbox synchronisation

When syncing with Dropbox, Joplin creates a sub-directory in Dropbox, in `/Apps/Joplin` and read/write the notes and notebooks from it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.

In the **desktop application** or **mobile application**, select &quot;Dropbox&quot; as the synchronisation target in the config screen (it is selected by default). Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the &quot;Synchronise&quot; button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.

In the **terminal application**, to initiate the synchronisation process, type `:sync`. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application. It is possible to also synchronise outside of the user interface by typing `j

## Installation

### Linux

#### Flatpak

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flathub Badge&quot; width=&quot;10%&quot; /&gt;](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl)

Heroic is available on Flathub, so you should be able to easily install it on most distros with Software Centers (Pop!\_Shop, Discover, etc.)

#### Distribution-specific instructions

If you&#039;re not using the Flatpak version, make sure you have all Wine dependencies installed:
[Wine Dependencies](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md).

#### Debian, Ubuntu and Derivatives

Download the file ending in .deb from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest).  
Double-click it to open it up in your Software Manager, or run `sudo dpkg -i Heroic_*_amd64.deb` to install it directly.

#### Arch (AUR)

We currently only support one AUR package: `heroic-games-launcher-bin`. Although you might find other packages there, do not ask support for them on this Github or on our Discord, ask their maintainers directly.

- [![Stable version badge](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/heroic-games-launcher-bin?style=flat&amp;label=heroic-games-launcher-bin)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin)  
  (stable release, recommended)

Please see [the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages) on how to install them

#### Fedora

##### COPR repo

Heroic for Fedora is available on [this COPR repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/heroic-games-launcher/).  
Enable it with `sudo dnf copr enable atim/heroic-games-launcher`, then install Heroic with `sudo dnf install heroic-games-launcher-bin`

##### Binary package from the releases page

You can alternatively download the file ending in .rpm from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest) and install it with `sudo dnf install ./heroic-*.x86_64.rpm`

#### Other Distributions (AppImage and TAR.XZ)

Since these two distribution formats don&#039;t have a form of dependency management, make sure the `curl` command is available. You might run into weird issues if it&#039;s not.

##### AppImage

- Download the file ending in .AppImage from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest)
- Make it executable (`chmod +x Heroic*.AppImage`)
- Run it (double-click in most file managers, or run `./Heroic*.AppImage`)

##### .tar.xz

- Download the file ending in .tar.xz from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest)
- Extract it anywhere
- Run the `heroic` file in the folder you extracted it to (double-click in most file managers, or run `./heroic`)

### Windows

#### WinGet

If you use WinGet (installed by default on Windows 11 and modern versions of 10), you can run `winget install Heroic` in a terminal to install Heroic.

#### Manual installl

Download the Heroic Installer (`Heroic-x.x.x-Setup.exe`) or the portable version (`Heroic-x.x.x-Portable.exe`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest). Run the executable you downloaded to install/run Heroic.  
The Setup will create shortcuts to Heroic on your Desktop and in your Start Menu.

### macOS

If you use Homebrew, you can run `brew install --cask --no-quarantine heroic` to install Heroic.  
Otherwise, download the file ending in .dmg from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest), double-click it to mount it, and drag the &quot;Heroic&quot; application into the &quot;Applications&quot; folder.

## Development environment

This part will walk you through setting up a development environment so you can build Heroic binaries yourself or make changes to the code.

1. Make sure Git, NodeJS, and pnpm 10 are installed  
   **NOTE**: On Windows, due to an issue with electron-builder, you&#039;ll need the standalone version of pnpm (`@pnpm/exe`)
   to build packages
2. Clone the repo and enter the cloned folder, for example with these commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher.git --recurse-submodules
   cd HeroicGamesLauncher
   ```

3. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `pnpm install`

### Building Heroic Binaries

Run the appropriate command for your OS:

- Build for Linux:

  ```bash
  pnpm dist:linux # Optionally specify a package to create (eg: deb, pacman, tar.xz, rpm, AppImage); default: AppImage
  ```

- Build for Windows:

  ```bash
  pnpm dist:win
  ```

- Build for Mac:
  ```bash
  pnpm dist:mac
  ```

### Building with VS Code

Instead of using the above commands to build Heroic, you can also use the Tasks in VSCode to build.
To do that, open up the command palette (Ctrl + P), type in &quot;task&quot; and press Space. You will then see 3 build tasks, &quot;Build for Linux&quot;, &quot;Build for Windows&quot;, and &quot;Build for MacOS&quot;. Click the one you want to run.

### Quickly testing/debugging Heroic on your own system

If you want to quickly test a change, or you&#039;re implementing features that require a lot of restarts, you can use Vite&#039;s development server to speed up the process:  
Go to the &quot;Run and Debug&quot; tab of VSCode and start the &quot;Launch Heroic (HMR &amp; HR)&quot; task (alternatively, if you&#039;re not using VSCode or just prefer the terminal, run `pnpm start`). Heroic will start up after a short while, and once you make any change to the code, it&#039;ll reload/restart.

## Installation

This is a quick start guide to get you up and running with WireGuard Easy.

For a more detailed installation guide, please refer to the [Getting Started](https://wg-easy.github.io/wg-easy/latest/getting-started/) page.

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven&#039;t installed Docker yet, install it by running as root:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
exit
```

And log in again.

### 2. Run WireGuard Easy

The easiest way to run WireGuard Easy is with Docker Compose.

Just download [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and execute `sudo docker compose up -d`.

Now setup a reverse proxy to be able to access the Web UI securely from the internet.

If you want to access the Web UI over HTTP, change the env var `INSECURE` to `true`. This is not recommended. Only use this for testing

## About

&lt;!-- &lt;Main description&gt;   --&gt;

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.

&gt; Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.

Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.
But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.&lt;br/&gt;
Mermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams. It can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Mermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed diagrams through the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).&lt;br/&gt;

## Shoutouts :tada:

Omnivore takes advantage of some great open source software:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Most of our backend and frontend are written in TypeScript.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Our frontend is a Next.JS app and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - We do all our data fetching on the web using SWR.
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) - We use Stitches on the frontend to style our components.
- [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) - We use Mozilla&#039;s Readability library to make pages easier to read.
- [Swift GraphQL](https://www.swift-graphql.com/) - We generate our GraphQL queries on iOS using Swift GraphQL.
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) - We generate our GraphQL queries on Android using Apollo GraphQL.
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - We use Radix UI&#039;s components on our frontend.
- [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) - PDF.js is used to have open source pdf functionality. 
- And many more awesome libraries, just checkout our package files to see what we are using.

## Importing Libraries

Check out our [docs](https://docs.omnivore.app/using/importing.html) for information on importing your data from other apps.

## How to setup local development :computer:

The easiest way to get started with local development is to use `docker compose up`. This will start a postgres container, our web frontend, an API server, and our content fetching microservice.

### Requirements for development

Omnivore is written in TypeScript and JavaScript.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.16) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) -- Versions are managed by [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started).
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) -- See below for installation info.

### Running the web and API services

#### 1. Start docker compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore
cd omnivore
docker compose up
```

This will start postgres, initialize the database, and start the web and api services.

#### 2. Open the browser

Open &lt;http://localhost:3000&gt; and confirm Omnivore is running

#### 3. Login with the test account

During database setup docker compose creates an account `demo@omnivore.app`, password: `demo_password`.

Go to &lt;http://localhost:3000/&gt; in your browser and choose `Continue with Email` to login.

### Frontend Development

If you want to work on just the frontend of Omnivore you can run the backend services
with docker compose and the frontend locally:

```bash
docker compose up api content-fetch
cd packages/web
cp .env.template .env.local
yarn dev
```

You will need to configure some values in the new `.env.local` file. These are
the values for running the `web` service directly on your host machine and
running `api` and `content-fetch` within docker:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIGHLIGHTS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Running the puppeteer-parse service outside of Docker

To save pages you need to run the `puppeteer-parse` service.

#### 1. Install and configure Chromium

```bash
brew install chromium --no-quarantine
export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
export CHROMIUM_PATH=`which chromium`
```

#### 2. Navigate to the service directory, setup your env file, and install dependencies

```bash
cd packages/puppeteer-parse
cp .env.example .env
yarn
```

#### 3. Start the service

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the puppeteer-parse service on port 9090.

In your browser go to &lt;http://localhost:3000/home&gt;, click the `Add Link` button,
and enter a URL such as `https://blog.omnivore.app/p/getting-started-with-omnivore`.

You should see a Chromium window open and navigate to your link. When the service
is done fetching your content you will see it in your library.

## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it&#039;s an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Preview

![video-preview](.assets/perplexica-preview.gif)

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user&#039;s query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
- **API**: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI&#039;s models**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama&#039;s models instead of OpenAI&#039;s**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq&#039;s hosted models**.
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your Anthropic API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models**.

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. After populating the configuration run `npm i`.
4. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build`.
5. Finally, start the app by running `npm rum start`

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Ollama Connection Errors

If you&#039;re encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama&#039;s API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://&lt;private_ip_of_host&gt;:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you&#039;re using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment=&quot;OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0&quot;`. Then restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser&#039;s search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser&#039;s settings.
2. Navigate to the &#039;Search Engines&#039; section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser&#039;s search bar.

## Using Perplexica&#039;s API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.
