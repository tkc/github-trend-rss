## What is AFFiNE

[AFFiNE](https://affine.pro) is an open-source, all-in-one workspace and an operating system for all the building blocks that assemble your knowledge base and much more -- wiki, knowledge management, presentation and digital assets. It&#039;s a better alternative to Notion and Miro.

## Features

**A true canvas for blocks in any form. Docs and whiteboard are now fully merged.**

- Many editor apps claim to be a canvas for productivity, but AFFiNE is one of the very few which allows you to put any building block on an edgeless canvas -- rich text, sticky notes, any embedded web pages, multi-view databases, linked pages, shapes and even slides. We have it all.

**Multimodal AI partner ready to kick in any work**

- Write up professional work report? Turn an outline into expressive and presentable slides? Summary an article into a well-structured mindmap? Sorting your job plan and backlog for tasks? Or... draw and code prototype apps and web pages directly all with one prompt? With you, [AFFiNE AI](https://affine.pro/ai) pushes your creativity to the edge of your imagination,just like [Canvas AI](https://affine.pro/blog/best-canvas-ai) to generate mind map for brainstorming.

**Local-first &amp; Real-time collaborative**

- We love the idea of local-first that you always own your data on your disk, in spite of the cloud. Furthermore, AFFiNE supports real-time sync and collaborations on web and cross-platform clients.

**Self-host &amp; Shape your own AFFiNE**

- You have the freedom to manage, self-host, fork and build your own AFFiNE. Plugin community and third-party blocks are coming soon. More tractions on [Blocksuite](https://blocksuite.io). Check there to learn how to [self-host AFFiNE](https://docs.affine.pro/docs/self-host-affine).

## Acknowledgement

“We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us”. A lot of pioneers have inspired us along the way, e.g.:

- Quip &amp; Notion with their great concept of “everything is a block”
- Trello with their Kanban
- Airtable &amp; Miro with their no-code programmable datasheets
- Miro &amp; Whimiscal with their edgeless visual whiteboard
- Remote &amp; Capacities with their object-based tag system

There is a large overlap of their atomic “building blocks” between these apps. They are not open source, nor do they have a plugin system like Vscode for contributors to customize. We want to have something that contains all the features we love and also goes one step even further.

Thanks for checking us out, we appreciate your interest and sincerely hope that AFFiNE resonates with you! 🎵 Checking https://affine.pro/ for more details ions.

Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why would you read this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful.

The information in this repository is condensed. Ultimately, the key to succeeding in technical interviews is consistent practice and I don&#039;t want to bore you with too many words. I tell you the minimum you need to know on how to go about navigating the interview process, you go and practice and land your dream job.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

## How is this repository different?

There are many awesome books like &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- Recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm package manager
- [E2B API Key](https://e2b.dev)
- LLM Provider API Key

### 1. Clone the repository

In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/e2b-dev/fragments.git
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

Enter the repository:

```
cd fragments
```

Run the following to install the required dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### 3. Set the environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file and set the following:

```sh
# Get your API key here - https://e2b.dev/
E2B_API_KEY=&quot;your-e2b-api-key&quot;

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Other providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=
TOGETHER_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS=
MISTRAL_API_KEY=
XAI_API_KEY=

### Optional env vars

# Domain of the site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=

# Rate limit
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=

# Vercel/Upstash KV (short URLs, rate limiting)
KV_REST_API_URL=
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=

# Supabase (auth)
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# PostHog (analytics)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=

### Disabling functionality (when uncommented)

# Disable API key and base URL input in the chat
# NEXT_PUBLIC_NO_API_KEY_INPUT=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_NO_BASE_URL_INPUT=

# Hide local models from the list of available models
# NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_LOCAL_MODELS=
```

### 4. Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build the web app

```
npm run build
```

## Customize

### Adding custom personas

1. Make sure [E2B CLI](https://e2b.dev/docs/cli/installation) is installed and you&#039;re logged in.

2. Add a new folder under [sandbox-templates/](sandbox-templates/)

3. Initialize a new template using E2B CLI:

    ```
    e2b template init
    ```

    This will create a new file called `e2b.Dockerfile`.

4. Adjust the `e2b.Dockerfile`

    Here&#039;s an example streamlit template:

    ```Dockerfile
    # You can use most Debian-based base images
    FROM python:3.19-slim

    RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib requests seaborn plotly

    # Copy the code to the container
    WORKDIR /home/user
    COPY . /home/user
    ```

5. Specify a custom start command in `e2b.toml`:

    ```toml
    start_cmd = &quot;cd /home/user &amp;&amp; streamlit run app.py&quot;
    ```

6. Deploy the template with the E2B CLI

    ```
    e2b template build --name &lt;template-name&gt;
    ```

    After the build has finished, you should get the following message:

    ```
    ✅ Building sandbox template &lt;template-id&gt; &lt;template-name&gt; finished.
    ```

7. Open [lib/templates.json](lib/templates.json) in your code editor.

    Add your new template to the list. Here&#039;s an example for Streamlit:

    ```json
    &quot;streamlit-developer&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Streamlit developer&quot;,
      &quot;lib&quot;: [
        &quot;streamlit&quot;,
        &quot;pandas&quot;,
        &quot;numpy&quot;,
        &quot;matplotlib&quot;,
        &quot;request&quot;,
        &quot;seaborn&quot;,
        &quot;plotly&quot;
      ],
      &quot;file&quot;: &quot;app.py&quot;,
      &quot;instructions&quot;: &quot;A streamlit app that reloads automatically.&quot;,
      &quot;port&quot;: 8501 // can be null
    },
    ```

    Provide a template id (as key), name, list of dependencies, entrypoint and a port (optional). You can also add additional instructions that will be given to the LLM.

4. Optionally, add a new logo under [public/thirdparty/templates](public/thirdparty/templates)

### Adding custom LLM models

1. Open [lib/models.json](lib/models.ts) in your code editor.

2. Add a new entry to the models list:

    ```json
    {
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;mistral-large&quot;,
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mistral Large&quot;,
      &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;Ollama&quot;,
      &quot;providerId&quot;: &quot;ollama&quot;
    }
    ```

    Where id is the model id, name is the model name (visible in the UI), provider is the provider name and providerId is the provider tag (see [adding providers](#adding-custom-llm-providers) below).

### Adding custom LLM providers

1. Open [lib/models.ts](lib/models.ts) in your code editor.

2. Add a new entry to the `providerConfigs` list:

    Example for fireworks:

    ```ts
    fireworks: () =&gt; createOpenAI({ apiKey: apiKey || process.env.FIREWORKS_API_KEY, baseURL: baseURL || &#039;https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1&#039; })(modelNameString),
    ```

3. Optionally, adjust the default structured output mode in the `getDefaultMode` function:

    ```ts
    if (providerId === &#039;fireworks&#039;) {
      return &#039;json&#039;
    }
    ```

4. Optionally, add a new logo under [public/thirdparty/logos](public/thirdparty/logos)

## Zerox OCR

&lt;/a&gt;

A dead simple way of OCR-ing a document for AI ingestion. Documents are meant to be a visual representation after all. With weird layouts, tables, charts, etc. The vision models just make sense!

The general logic:

- Pass in a file (PDF, DOCX, image, etc.)
- Convert that file into a series of images
- Pass each image to GPT and ask nicely for Markdown
- Aggregate the responses and return Markdown

## Node Zerox

(Node.js SDK - supports vision models from different providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, etc.)

### Installation

```sh
npm install zerox
```

Zerox uses `graphicsmagick` and `ghostscript` for the PDF =&gt; image processing step. These should be pulled automatically, but you may need to manually install.

On linux use:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y graphicsmagick
```

## Usage

**With file URL**

```ts
import { zerox } from &quot;zerox&quot;;

const result = await zerox({
  filePath: &quot;https://omni-demo-data.s3.amazonaws.com/test/cs101.pdf&quot;,
  credentials: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

**From local path**

```ts
import { zerox } from &quot;zerox&quot;;
import path from &quot;path&quot;;

const result = await zerox({
  filePath: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;./cs101.pdf&quot;),
  credentials: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

### Parameters

```ts
const result = await zerox({
  // Required
  filePath: &quot;path/to/file&quot;,
  credentials: {
    apiKey: &quot;your-api-key&quot;,
    // Additional provider-specific credentials as needed
  },

  // Optional
  cleanup: true, // Clear images from tmp after run
  concurrency: 10, // Number of pages to run at a time
  correctOrientation: true, // True by default, attempts to identify and correct page orientation
  directImageExtraction: false, // Extract data directly from document images instead of the markdown
  errorMode: ErrorMode.IGNORE, // ErrorMode.THROW or ErrorMode.IGNORE, defaults to ErrorMode.IGNORE
  extractionPrompt: &quot;&quot;, // LLM instructions for extracting data from document
  extractOnly: false, // Set to true to only extract structured data using a schema
  extractPerPage, // Extract data per page instead of the entire document
  imageDensity: 300, // DPI for image conversion
  imageHeight: 2048, // Maximum height for converted images
  llmParams: {}, // Additional parameters to pass to the LLM
  maintainFormat: false, // Slower but helps maintain consistent formatting
  maxImageSize: 15, // Maximum size of images to compress, defaults to 15MB
  maxRetries: 1, // Number of retries to attempt on a failed page, defaults to 1
  maxTesseractWorkers: -1, // Maximum number of Tesseract workers. Zerox will start with a lower number and only reach maxTesseractWorkers if needed
  model: ModelOptions.OPENAI_GPT_4O, // Model to use (supports various models from different providers)
  modelProvider: ModelProvider.OPENAI, // Choose from OPENAI, BEDROCK, GOOGLE, or AZURE
  outputDir: undefined, // Save combined result.md to a file
  pagesToConvertAsImages: -1, // Page numbers to convert to image as array (e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`) or a number (e.g. `1`). Set to -1 to convert all pages
  prompt: &quot;&quot;, // LLM instructions for processing the document
  schema: undefined, // Schema for structured data extraction
  tempDir: &quot;/os/tmp&quot;, // Directory to use for temporary files (default: system temp directory)
  trimEdges: true, // True by default, trims pixels from all edges that contain values similar to the given background color, which defaults to that of the top-left pixel
});
```

The `maintainFormat` option tries to return the markdown in a consistent format by passing the output of a prior page in as additional context for the next page. This requires the requests to run synchronously, so it&#039;s a lot slower. But valuable if your documents have a lot of tabular data, or frequently have tables that cross pages.

```
Request #1 =&gt; page_1_image
Request #2 =&gt; page_1_markdown + page_2_image
Request #3 =&gt; page_2_markdown + page_3_image
```

### Data Extraction

Zerox supports structured data extraction from documents using a schema. This allows you to pull specific information from documents in a structured format instead of getting the full markdown conversion.

Set `extractOnly: true` and provide a `schema` to extract structured data. The schema follows the [JSON Schema standard](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/).

Use `extractPerPage` to extract data per page instead of from the whole document at once.

You can also set `extractionModel`, `extractionModelProvider`, and `extractionCredentials` to use a different model for extraction than OCR. By default, the same model is used.

## Python Zerox

(Python SDK - supports vision models from different providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, etc.)

### Installation

- Install **poppler** on the system, it should be available in path variable. See the [pdf2image documentation](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for instructions by platform.
- Install py-zerox:

```sh
pip install py-zerox
```

The `pyzerox.zerox` function is an asynchronous API that performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to markdown using vision models. It processes PDF files and converts them into markdown format. Make sure to set up the environment variables for the model and the model provider before using this API.

Refer to the [LiteLLM Documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for setting up the environment and passing the correct model name.

### Usage

```python
from pyzerox import zerox
import os
import json
import asyncio

### Model Setup (Use only Vision Models) Refer: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers ###

                    &#039;### 26.3.1. Declaration &amp; Assignment\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;Java is a statically typed language meaning that all variables must be declared before you can use &#039; +
                    &#039;them or refer to them. In addition, when declaring a variable, you must specify both its type and &#039; +
                    &#039;its identifier. For example:\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;```java\n&#039; +
                    &#039;int numUnits;\n&#039; +
                    &#039;double costPerUnit;\n&#039; +
                    &#039;char firstInitial;\n&#039; +
                    &#039;boolean isStudent;\n&#039; +
                    &#039;```\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;Each declaration specifies the variable’s type followed by the identifier and ending with a &#039; +

                    &#039;character. We adopt the modern camelCasing naming convention for variables in our code. In &#039; +
                    &#039;general, variables must be assigned a value before you can use them in an expression. You do not &#039; +
                    &#039;have to immediately assign a value when you declare them (though it is good practice), but some &#039; +
                    &#039;value must be assigned before they can be used or the compiler will issue an error.\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;The assignment operator is a single equal sign, `=` and is a right-to-left assignment. That is, &#039; +
                    &#039;the variable that we wish to assign the value to appears on the left-hand-side while the value &#039; +
                    &#039;(literal, variable or expression) is on the right-hand-side. Using our variables from before, &#039; +
                    &#039;we can assign them values:\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;&gt; 2 Instance variables, that is variables declared as part of an object do have default values. &#039; +
                    &#039;For objects, the default is `null`, for all numeric types, zero is the default value. For the &#039; +
                    &#039;boolean type, `false` is the default, and the default char value is `\\0`, the null-terminating &#039; +

## Overview

**Data Formulator** is an application from Microsoft Research that uses large language models to transform data, expediting the practice of data visualization.

Data Formulator is an AI-powered tool for analysts to iteratively create rich visualizations. Unlike most chat-based AI tools where users need to describe everything in natural language, Data Formulator combines *user interface interactions (UI)* and *natural language (NL) inputs* for easier interaction. This blended approach makes it easier for users to describe their chart designs while delegating data transformation to AI. 

## Get Started

Play with Data Formulator with one of the following options:

- **Option 1: Install via Python PIP**
  
  Use Python PIP for an easy setup experience, running locally (recommend: install it in a virtual environment).
  
  ```bash
  # install data_formulator
  pip install data_formulator

  # start data_formulator
  data_formulator 
  
  # alternatively, you can run data formulator with this command
  python -m data_formulator
  ```

  Data Formulator will be automatically opened in the browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

  *Update: you can specify the port number (e.g., 8080) by `python -m data_formulator --port 8080` if the default port is occupied.*

- **Option 2: Codespaces (5 minutes)**
  
  You can also run Data Formulator in Codespaces; we have everything pre-configured. For more details, see [CODESPACES.md](CODESPACES.md).
  
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/data-formulator?quickstart=1)

- **Option 3: Working in the developer mode**
  
  You can build Data Formulator locally if you prefer full control over your development environment and the ability to customize the setup to your specific needs. For detailed instructions, refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).


## Using Data Formulator

Once you&#039;ve completed the setup using either option, follow these steps to start using Data Formulator:

### The basics of data visualization
* Provide OpenAI keys and select a model (GPT-4o suggested) and choose a dataset.
* Choose a chart type, and then drag-and-drop data fields to chart properties (x, y, color, ...) to specify visual encodings.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fbea012-1d2d-46c3-a923-b1fc5eb5e5b8


### Create visualization beyond the initial dataset (powered by 🤖)
* You can type names of **fields that do not exist in current data** in the encoding shelf:
    - this tells Data Formulator that you want to create visualizations that require computation or transformation from existing data,
    - you can optionally provide a natural language prompt to explain and clarify your intent (not necessary when field names are self-explanatory).
* Click the **Formulate** button.
    - Data Formulator will transform data and instantiate the visualization based on the encoding and prompt.
* Inspect the data, chart and code.
* To create a new chart based on existing ones, follow up in natural language:
    - provide a follow up prompt (e.g., *``show only top 5!&#039;&#039;*),
    - you may also update visual encodings for the new chart.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/160c69d2-f42d-435c-9ff3-b1229b5bddba

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93b3e84-8ca8-49ae-80ea-f91ceef34acb

Repeat this process as needed to explore and understand your data. Your explorations are trackable in the **Data Threads** panel. 

## Developers&#039; Guide

Follow the [developers&#039; instructions](DEVELOPMENT.md) to build your new data analysis tools on top of Data Formulator.

To continue improving your experience, we have to eventually deprecate or remove certain addons in favor of new and better tools.

If you&#039;re using info/notes, we highly recommend you migrate to [docs](code/addons/docs/) instead, and [here is a guide](code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#migrating-from-notesinfo-addons) to help you.

If you&#039;re using contexts, we highly recommend you migrate to [toolbars](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/toolbars) and [here is a guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#deprecated-addon-contexts) to help you.

If you&#039;re using addon-storyshots, we highly recommend you migrate to the Storybook [test-runner](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner) and [here is a guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/storyshots-migration-guide) to help you.

### Development scripts

Storybook is organized as a monorepo. Useful scripts include:

#### `yarn start`

&gt; Runs a sandbox template storybook with test stories

#### `yarn task`

&gt; As above, but gives you options to customize the sandbox (e.g. selecting other frameworks)

#### `yarn lint`

&gt; boolean check if code conforms to linting rules - uses remark &amp; eslint

- `yarn lint:js` - will check js
- `yarn lint:md` - will check markdown + code samples
- `yarn lint:js --fix` - will automatically fix js

#### `yarn test`

&gt; boolean check if unit tests all pass - uses jest

- `yarn run test --core --watch` - will run core tests in watch-mode

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Cloudflare MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [new, standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. In this repository, we provide an installer as well as an MCP Server for [Cloudflare&#039;s API](https://api.cloudflare.com).

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any MCP Client, to use natural language to accomplish things on your Cloudflare account, e.g.:

* `Please deploy me a new Worker with an example durable object.`
* `Can you tell me about the data in my D1 database named &#039;...&#039;?`
* `Can you copy all the entries from my KV namespace &#039;...&#039; into my R2 bucket &#039;...&#039;?`

## Demo

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGajZpl_9yA&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/vGajZpl_9yA/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Demonstrating the newly-released MCP server to explore Cloudflare properties, like Workers, KV, and D1.&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Setup

1. Run `npx @cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare init`

   &gt; **Note:** The MCP server will automatically run `npx wrangler login` if you&#039;re not already authenticated with Cloudflare. You&#039;ll be prompted to complete the authentication process in your browser if needed.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Paid Features

Some features in this MCP server require a paid Cloudflare Workers plan:

- **Observability and Analytics**: The `analytics_get` tool and related analytics features require a paid Workers plan to access these metrics
- Other premium Cloudflare features like advanced D1 database capabilities and higher usage limits also require appropriate paid plans

Ensure your Cloudflare account has the necessary subscription level for the features you intend to use.

## Developing

In the current project folder, run:

```
pnpm install
pnpm build:watch
```

Then, in a second terminal:

```
node dist/index.js init
```

This will link Claude Desktop against your locally-installed version for you to test. If you&#039;re not already authenticated with Wrangler, the server will automatically prompt you to complete the authentication process in your browser.

## Testing

The project uses Vitest as the testing framework with MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking.

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
pnpm test -- tests/tools/queues.test.ts
```

To run tests in watch mode (useful during development):

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

### Test Structure

The test suite is organized as follows:

- `tests/tools/`: Contains tests for each Cloudflare API tool
- `tests/mocks/`: Contains mock data and request handlers
- `tests/utils/`: Contains test helper functions
- `tests/setup.ts`: Global test setup configuration

Each tool test file follows a consistent pattern of testing both successful operations and error handling scenarios.

## Usage outside of Claude

To run the server locally, run `node dist/index run &lt;account-id&gt;`.

If you&#039;re using an alternative MCP Client, or testing things locally, emit the `tools/list` command to get an up-to-date list of all available tools. Then you can call these directly using the `tools/call` command.

  &lt;img width=&quot;380&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/zempur9oh4/badge&quot; alt=&quot;Claude Desktop Commander MCP server&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

This is server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of [MCP Filesystem Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities .

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements

## Installation
First, ensure you&#039;ve downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Installing via Smithery

To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
```

### Option 2: Install trough npx
Just run this in terminal
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander setup
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 3: Add to claude_desktop_config by hand
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Mac, found at ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;desktop-commander&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 4: Checkout locally
1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run setup
```
Restart Claude if running

The setup command will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the server
- Configure Claude&#039;s desktop app
- Add MCP servers to Claude&#039;s config if needed

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes &lt;20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes &gt;20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
console.log(&quot;old message&quot;);
=======
console.log(&quot;new message&quot;);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Model Context Protocol Integration

This project extends the MCP Filesystem Server to enable:
- Local server support in Claude Desktop
- Full system command execution
- Process management
- File operations
- Code editing with search/replace blocks

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Open Canvas

[TRY IT OUT HERE](https://opencanvas.langchain.com/)

![Screenshot of app](./static/screenshot.png)

Open Canvas is an open source web application for collaborating with agents to better write documents. It is inspired by [OpenAI&#039;s &quot;Canvas&quot;](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/), but with a few key differences.

1. **Open Source**: All the code, from the frontend, to the content generation agent, to the reflection agent is open source and MIT licensed.
2. **Built in memory**: Open Canvas ships out of the box with a [reflection agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/reflection/reflection/) which stores style rules and user insights in a [shared memory store](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/). This allows Open Canvas to remember facts about you across sessions.
3. **Start from existing documents**: Open Canvas allows users to start with a blank text, or code editor in the language of their choice, allowing you to start the session with your existing content, instead of being forced to start with a chat interaction. We believe this is an ideal UX because many times you will already have some content to start with, and want to iterate on-top of it.

## Features

- **Memory**: Open Canvas has a built in memory system which will automatically generate reflections and memories on you, and your chat history. These are then included in subsequent chat interactions to give a more personalized experience.
- **Custom quick actions**: Custom quick actions allow you to define your own prompts which are tied to your user, and persist across sessions. These then can be easily invoked through a single click, and apply to the artifact you&#039;re currently viewing.
- **Pre-built quick actions**: There are also a series of pre-built quick actions for common writing and coding tasks that are always available.
- **Artifact versioning**: All artifacts have a &quot;version&quot; tied to them, allowing you to travel back in time and see previous versions of your artifact.
- **Code, Markdown, or both**: The artifact view allows for viewing and editing both code, and markdown. You can even have chats which generate code, and markdown artifacts, and switch between them.
- **Live markdown rendering &amp; editing**: Open Canvas&#039;s markdown editor allows you to view the rendered markdown while you&#039;re editing, without having to toggle back and fourth.

## Setup locally

This guide will cover how to setup and run Open Canvas locally. If you prefer a YouTube video guide, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/sBzcQYPMekc).

### Prerequisites

Open Canvas requires the following API keys and external services:

#### Package Manager

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### APIs

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- (optional) [Google GenAI API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- (optional) [Fireworks AI API key](https://fireworks.ai/login)
- (optional) [Groq AI API key](https://groq.com) - audio/video transcription
- (optional) [FireCrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev) - web scraping
- (optional) [ExaSearch API key](https://exa.ai) - web search


#### Authentication

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for authentication

#### LangGraph Server

- [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/cli/) for running the graph locally

#### LangSmith

- [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for tracing &amp; observability

### Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-canvas.git
cd open-canvas
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

After installing dependencies, copy the contents of both `.env.example` files in the root of the project, and in `apps/web` into `.env` and set the required values:

```bash
# The root `.env` file will be read by the LangGraph server for the agents.
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
# The `apps/web/.env` file will be read by the frontend.
cd apps/web/
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, setup authentication with Supabase.

### Setup Authentication

After creating a Supabase account, visit your [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) and create a new project.

Next, navigate to the `Project Settings` page inside your project, and then to the `API` tag. Copy the `Project URL`, and `anon public` project API key. Paste them into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables in the `apps/web/.env` file.

After this, navigate to the `Authentication` page, and the `Providers` tab. Make sure `Email` is enabled (also ensure you&#039;ve enabled `Confirm Email`). You may also enable `GitHub`, and/or `Google` if you&#039;d like to use those for authentication. (see these pages for documentation on how to setup each provider: [GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github), [Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google))

#### Test authentication

To verify authentication works, run `yarn dev` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This should redirect you to the [login page](http://localhost:3000/auth/login). From here, you can either login with Google or GitHub, or if you did not configure these providers, navigate to the [signup page](http://localhost:3000/auth/signup) and create a new account with an email and password. This should then redirect you to a conformation page, and after confirming your email you should be redirected to the [home page](http://localhost:3000).

### Setup LangGraph Server

The first step to running Open Canvas locally is to build the application. This is because Open Canvas uses a monorepo setup, and requires workspace dependencies to be build so other packages/apps can access them.

Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
yarn build
```

Now we&#039;ll cover how to setup and run the LangGraph server locally.

Navigate to `apps/agents` and run `yarn dev` (this runs `npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev --port 54367`).

```
Ready!
- 🚀 API: http://localhost:54367
- 🎨 Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:54367
```

After your LangGraph server is running, execute the following command inside `apps/web` to start the Open Canvas frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

On initial load, compilation may take a little bit of time.

Then, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and start interacting!

## LLM Models

Open Canvas is designed to be compatible with any LLM model. The current deployment has the following models configured:

- **Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku 👤**: Haiku is Anthropic&#039;s fastest model, great for quick tasks like making edits to your document. Sign up for an Anthropic account [here](https://console.anthropic.com/).
- **Fireworks Llama 3 70B 🦙**: Llama 3 is a SOTA open source model from Meta, powered by [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/). You can sign up for an account [here](https://fireworks.ai/login).
- **OpenAI GPT 4o Mini 💨**: GPT 4o Mini is OpenAI&#039;s newest, smallest model. You can sign up for an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

If you&#039;d like to add a new model, follow these simple steps:

1. Add to or update the model provider variables in `packages/shared/src/models.ts`.
2. Install the necessary package for the provider (e.g. `@langchain/anthropic`) inside `apps/agents`.
3. Update the `getModelConfig` function in `apps/agents/src/agent/utils.ts` to include an `if` statement for your new model name and provider.
4. Manually test by checking you can:
   &gt; - 4a. Generate a new artifact
   &gt; - 4b. Generate a followup message (happens automatically after generating an artifact)
   &gt; - 4c. Update an artifact via a message in chat
   &gt; - 4d. Update an artifact via a quick action
   &gt; - 4e. Repeat for text/code (ensure both work)

### Local Ollama models

Open Canvas supports calling local LLMs running on Ollama. This is not enabled in the hosted version of Open Canvas, but you can use this in your own local/deployed Open Canvas instance.

To use a local Ollama model, first ensure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed, and a model that supports tool calling pulled (the default model is `llama3.3`).

Next, start the Ollama server by running `ollama run llama3.3`.

Then, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`, and the `OLLAMA_API_URL` environment variable to the URL of your Ollama server (defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. If you do not set a custom port when starting your Ollama server, you should not need to set this environment variable).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Open source LLMs are typically not as good at instruction following as proprietary models like GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet. Because of this, you may experience errors or unexpected behavior when using local LLMs.

## Troubleshooting

Below are some common issues you may run into if running Open Canvas yourself:

- **I have the LangGraph server running successfully, and my client can make requests, but no text is being generated:** This can happen if you start &amp; connect to multiple different LangGraph servers locally in the same browser. Try clearing the `oc_thread_id_v2` cookie and refreshing the page. This is because each unique LangGraph server has its own database where threads are stored, so a thread ID from one server will not be found in the database of another server.

- **I&#039;m getting 500 network errors when I try to make requests on the client:** Ensure you have the LangGraph server running, and you&#039;re making requests to the correct port. You can specify the port to use by passing the `--port &lt;PORT&gt;` flag to the `npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev` command, and you can set the URL to make requests to by either setting the `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` environment variable, or by changing the fallback value of the `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` variable in `constants.ts`.

- **I&#039;m getting &quot;thread ID not found&quot; error toasts when I try to make requests on the client:** Ensure you have the LangGraph server running, and you&#039;re making requests to the correct port. You can specify the port to use by passing the `--port &lt;PORT&gt;` flag to the `npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev` command, and you can set the URL to make requests to by either setting the `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` environment variable, or by changing the fallback value of the `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` variable in `constants.ts`.

- **`Model name is missing in config.` error is being thrown when I make requests:** This error occurs when the `customModelName` is not specified in the config. You can resolve this by setting the `customModelName` field inside `config.configurable` to the name of the model you want to use when invoking the graph. See [this doc](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/configuration/) on how to use configurable fields in LangGraph.

## Roadmap

### Features

Below is a list of features we&#039;d like to add to Open Canvas in the near future:

- **Render React in the editor**: Ideally, if you have Open Canvas generate React (or HTML) code, we should be able to render it live in the editor. **Edit**: This is in the planning stage now!
- **Multiple assistants**: Users should be able to create multiple assistants, each having their own memory store.
- **Give assistants custom &#039;tools&#039;**: Once we&#039;ve implemented `RemoteGraph` in LangGraph.js, users should be able to give assistants access to call their own graphs as tools. This means you could customize your assistant to have access to current events, your own personal knowledge graph, etc.

Do you have a feature request? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-canvas/issues/new)!

### Contributing

We&#039;d like to continue developing and improving Open Canvas, and want your help!

To start, there are a handful of GitHub issues with feature requests outlining improvements and additions to make the app&#039;s UX even better.
There are three main labels:

- `frontend`: This label is added to issues which are UI focused, and do not require much if any work on the agent(s).
- `ai`: This label is added to issues which are focused on improving the LLM agent(s).
- `fullstack`: This label is added to issues which require touching both the frontend and agent code.

If you have questions about contributing, please reach out to me via email: `brace(at)langchain(dot)dev`. For general bugs/issues with the code, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-canvas/issues/new).

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production.

## Quick start

&gt; Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
&gt;
&gt; - CPU &gt;= 2 Core
&gt; - RAM &gt;= 4 GiB

&lt;/br&gt;

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [docker compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

#### Seeking help

## Advanced Setup

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [.env.example](docker/.env.example) file and update the corresponding values in your `.env` file. Additionally, you might need to make adjustments to the `docker-compose.yaml` file itself, such as changing image versions, port mappings, or volume mounts, based on your specific deployment environment and requirements. After making any changes, please re-run `docker-compose up -d`. You can find the full list of available environment variables [here](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

If you&#039;d like to configure a highly-available setup, there are community-contributed [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/) and YAML files which allow Dify to be deployed on Kubernetes.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js)

The Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript enables both client-side and server-side JavaScript applications to authenticate users using [Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) for work and school accounts (AAD), Microsoft personal accounts (MSA), and social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft accounts, etc. through [Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview#identity-providers) service. It also enables your app to get tokens to access [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise) services such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).
