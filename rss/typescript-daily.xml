**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone&#039;s hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn&#039;t trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it&#039;s trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you&#039;re using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the [website](https://handy.computer)
2. Install the application following platform-specific instructions
3. Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## Known Issues &amp; Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11            | `xdotool`        | `sudo apt install xdotool`                         |
| Wayland        | `wtype`          | `sudo apt install wtype`                           |
| Both           | `dotool`         | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- You can manage global shortcuts outside of Handy and still control the app via signals. Sending `SIGUSR2` to the Handy process toggles recording on/off, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings. Example (Sway):

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy
  ```

  `pkill` here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don&#039;t meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Roadmap &amp; Active Development

We&#039;re actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### In Progress

**Debug Logging:**

- Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues

**macOS Keyboard Improvements:**

- Support for Globe key as transcription trigger
- A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS&#039;s too.

**Opt-in Analytics:**

- Collect anonymous usage data to help improve Handy
- Privacy-first approach with clear opt-in

**Settings Refactoring:**

- Cleanup and refactor settings system which is becoming bloated and messy
- Implement better abstractions for settings management

**Tauri Commands Cleanup:**

- Abstract and organize Tauri command patterns
- Investigate tauri-specta for improved type safety and organization

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Model Installation (For Proxy Users or Network Restrictions)

If you&#039;re behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handy cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.

#### Step 1: Find Your App Data Directory

1. Open Handy settings
2. Navigate to the **About** section
3. Copy the &quot;App Data Directory&quot; path shown there, or use the shortcuts:
   - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D` to open debug menu
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open debug menu

The typical paths are:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.pais.handy/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.pais.handy\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.pais.handy/`

#### Step 2: Create Models Directory

Inside your app data directory, create a `models` folder if it doesn&#039;t already exist:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.pais.handy/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path &quot;$env:APPDATA\com.pais.handy\models&quot;
```

#### Step 3: Download Model Files

Download the models you want from below

**Whisper Models (single .bin files):**

- Small (487 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin`
- Medium (492 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin`
- Turbo (1600 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`
- Large (1100 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin`

**Parakeet Models (compressed archives):**

- V2 (473 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz`
- V3 (478 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Install Models

**For Whisper Models (.bin files):**

Simply place the `.bin` file directly into the `models` directory:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
```

**For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):**

1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Place the **extracted directory** into the `models` folder
3. The directory must be named exactly as follows:
   - **Parakeet V2**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`
   - **Parakeet V3**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`

Final structure should look like:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
```

**Important Notes:**

- For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name **must** match exactly as shown above
- Do not rename the `.bin` files for Whisper models—use the exact filenames from the download URLs
- After placing the files, restart Handy to detect the new models

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Restart Handy
2. Open Settings → Models
3. Your manually installed models should now appear as &quot;Downloaded&quot;
4. Select the model you want to use and test transcription

## What is Puck?

Puck is a modular, open-source visual editor for React.js. You can use Puck to build custom drag-and-drop experiences with your own application and React components.

Because Puck is just a React component, it plays well with all React.js environments, including Next.js. You own your data and there’s no vendor lock-in.

Puck is also [licensed under MIT](https://github.com/puckeditor/puck?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme), making it suitable for both internal systems and commercial applications.

## Quick start

Install the package:

```sh
npm i @puckeditor/core --save # or npx create-puck-app my-app
```

Render the editor:

```jsx
// Editor.jsx
import { Puck } from &quot;@puckeditor/core&quot;;
import &quot;@puckeditor/core/puck.css&quot;;

// Create Puck component config
const config = {
  components: {
    HeadingBlock: {
      fields: {
        children: {
          type: &quot;text&quot;,
        },
      },
      render: ({ children }) =&gt; {
        return &lt;h1&gt;{children}&lt;/h1&gt;;
      },
    },
  },
};

// Describe the initial data
const initialData = {};

// Save the data to your database
const save = (data) =&gt; {};

// Render Puck editor
export function Editor() {
  return &lt;Puck config={config} data={initialData} onPublish={save} /&gt;;
}
```

Render the page:

```jsx
// Page.jsx
import { Render } from &quot;@puckeditor/core&quot;;

&lt;/details&gt;

## **🚀 Getting Started**

&gt; **🔓 Build in Public** — Eigent is **100% open source** from day one. Every feature, every commit, every decision is transparent. We believe the best AI tools should be built openly with the community, not behind closed doors.

### 🏠 Local Deployment (Recommended)

The recommended way to run Eigent — fully standalone with complete control over your data, no cloud account required.

👉 **[Full Local Deployment Guide](./server/README_EN.md)**

This setup includes:
- Local backend server with full API
- Local model integration (vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- Complete isolation from cloud services
- Zero external dependencies

### ⚡ Quick Start (Cloud-Connected)

For a quick preview using our cloud backend — get started in seconds:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18-22) and npm

#### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eigent-ai/eigent.git
cd eigent
npm install
npm run dev
```

&gt; Note: This mode connects to Eigent cloud services and requires account registration. For a fully standalone experience, use [Local Deployment](#-local-deployment-recommended) instead.

### 🏢 Enterprise

For organizations requiring maximum security, customization, and control:

- **Exclusive Features** (like SSO &amp; custom development)
- **Scalable Enterprise Deployment**
- **Negotiated SLAs** &amp; implementation services

Unlock the full potential of exceptional productivity with Eigent’s powerful features—built for seamless integration, smarter task execution, and boundless automation.

### 🏭 Workforce 
Employs a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. Eigent dynamically breaks down tasks and activates multiple agents to work **in parallel.**

Eigent pre-defined the following agent workers:

- **Developer Agent:** Writes and executes code, runs terminal commands.
- **Search Agent:** Searches the web and extracts content.
- **Document Agent:** Creates and manages documents.
- **Multi-Modal Agent:** Processes images and audio.

![AGENTS.md logo](./public/og.png)

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) is a simple, open format for guiding coding agents.

Think of AGENTS.md as a README for agents: a dedicated, predictable place
to provide context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project.

Below is a minimal example of an AGENTS.md file:

```markdown
# Sample AGENTS.md file

## Dev environment tips
- Use `pnpm dlx turbo run where &lt;project_name&gt;` to jump to a package instead of scanning with `ls`.
- Run `pnpm install --filter &lt;project_name&gt;` to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.
- Use `pnpm create vite@latest &lt;project_name&gt; -- --template react-ts` to spin up a new React + Vite package with TypeScript checks ready.
- Check the name field inside each package&#039;s package.json to confirm the right name—skip the top-level one.

## Testing instructions
- Find the CI plan in the .github/workflows folder.
- Run `pnpm turbo run test --filter &lt;project_name&gt;` to run every check defined for that package.
- From the package root you can just call `pnpm test`. The commit should pass all tests before you merge.
- To focus on one step, add the Vitest pattern: `pnpm vitest run -t &quot;&lt;test name&gt;&quot;`.
- Fix any test or type errors until the whole suite is green.
- After moving files or changing imports, run `pnpm lint --filter &lt;project_name&gt;` to be sure ESLint and TypeScript rules still pass.
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.

## PR instructions
- Title format: [&lt;project_name&gt;] &lt;Title&gt;
- Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before committing.
```

## Website

This repository also includes a basic Next.js website hosted at https://agents.md/
that explains the project’s goals in a simple way, and featuring some examples.

## 👩‍⚖️ License

### The AGPL Formbricks Core

The Formbricks core application is licensed under the [AGPLv3 Open Source License](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/LICENSE). The core application is fully functional and includes everything you need to design &amp; run link surveys, website surveys and in-app surveys. You can use the software for free for personal and commercial use. You&#039;re also allowed to create and distribute modified versions as long as you document the changes you make incl. date. The AGPL license requires you to publish your modified version under the AGPLv3 license as well.

### The Enterprise Edition

Additional to the AGPL licensed Formbricks core, this repository contains code licensed under an Enterprise license. The [code](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/apps/web/modules/ee) and [license](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/web/modules/ee/LICENSE) for the enterprise functionality can be found in the `/apps/web/modules/ee` folder of this repository. This additional functionality is not part of the AGPLv3 licensed Formbricks core and is designed to meet the needs of larger teams and enterprises. This advanced functionality is already included in the Docker images, but you need an [Enterprise License Key](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/enterprise) to unlock it.

### White-Labeling Formbricks and Other Licensing Needs

We currently do not offer Formbricks white-labeled. That means that we don&#039;t sell a license which let&#039;s other companies resell Formbricks to third parties under their name nor take parts (like the survey editor) out of Formbricks to add to their own software products. Any other needs? [Send us an email](mailto:hola@formbricks.com).

### Why charge for Enterprise Features?

The Enterprise Edition allows us to fund the development of Formbricks sustainably. It guarantees that the free and open-source surveying infrastructure we&#039;re building will be around for decades to come.

No more deciding which of the four different values for total revenue is the **_right_** one (you can thank us later 😉).

### 🤝 **Build trust in your data.**

We want everyone at your company to feel like they can trust the data. So, why not **_show_** them that they can?

We bring the context you want around data quality _into_ your BI tool so people know that they can trust the data.

### 🧱 **Give users meaningful building blocks to answer their own data questions.**

With Lightdash, you can leave the SQL to the experts. We give your data team the tools they need to build metrics and dimensions that everyone else can use.

So, anybody in the business can combine, segment, and filter these metrics and dimensions to answer their own questions.

### 📖 **Open source, now and forever**

**Lightdash is built with our community, for our community.**

We think that a BI tool should be affordable, configurable, and secure - and being open source lets us be all three 🙂

### 🤑 **Affordable analytics**

Love Looker, but don&#039;t love Looker&#039;s price tag?

With Lightdash, we offer a free self-hosted service (it&#039;s all just open source!), or an affordable cloud-service option if you&#039;re looking for an easy analytics set up.

## The Lightdash Forest

We&#039;re planting trees with the help of the Lightdash community.

Tree planting is one of the simplest and most cost-effective means of mitigating climate change, by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. So we thought it would be pretty neat to grow a forest while we grow Lightdash.

Want to help us grow our forest?

Just star this repo! We plant a tree for every star we get on Github. ⭐️ ➡️ 🌱

We plant trees with TIST, you can read all about them here: https://program.tist.org/.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Is this software free?

_Yes. This software is completely free.
You do not need an account, login, or subscription.
All you need is an internet connection._

### Can using this software get my Spotify account suspended or banned?

_No.
This software has no connection to your Spotify account.
Spotify data is obtained through reverse engineering of the Spotify Web Player, not through user authentication._

### Where does the audio come from?

_The audio is fetched using third-party APIs._

### Why does metadata fetching sometimes fail?

_This usually happens because your IP address has been rate-limited.
You can wait and try again later, or use a VPN to bypass the rate limit._

### Why does Windows Defender or antivirus flag or delete the file?

_This is a false positive.
It likely happens because the executable is compressed using UPX._

_If you are concerned, you can fork the repository and build the software yourself from source._

            <h2>README</h2><pre># ▲ AI Elements

[AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) is a component library built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to help you build AI-native applications faster.

## Overview

AI Elements provides pre-built, customizable React components specifically designed for AI applications, including conversations, messages, code blocks, reasoning displays, and more. The CLI makes it easy to add these components to your Next.js project.

## Installation

You can use the AI Elements CLI directly with npx, or install it globally:

```bash
# Use directly (recommended)
npx ai-elements@latest

# Or using shadcn cli
npx shadcn@latest add https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/api/registry/all.json
```

## Prerequisites

Before using AI Elements, ensure your project meets these requirements:

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **Next.js** project with [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) installed
- **shadcn/ui** initialized in your project (`npx shadcn@latest init`)
- **Tailwind CSS** configured (AI Elements supports CSS Variables mode only)

## Usage

### Install All Components

Install all available AI Elements components at once:

```bash
npx ai-elements@latest
```

This command will:

- Set up shadcn/ui if not already configured
- Install all AI Elements components to your configured components directory
- Add necessary dependencies to your project

### Install Specific Components

Install individual components using the `add` command:

```bash
npx ai-elements@latest add &lt;component-name&gt;
```

Examples:

```bash
# Install the message component
npx ai-elements@latest add message

# Install the conversation component
npx ai-elements@latest add conversation

# Install the code-block component
npx ai-elements@latest add code-block
```

### Alternative: Use with shadcn CLI

You can also install components using the standard shadcn/ui CLI:

```bash
# Install all components
npx shadcn@latest add https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/api/registry/all.json

# Install a specific component
npx shadcn@latest add https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/api/registry/message.json
```

## Quick Start Example

After installing components, you can use them in your React application:

```tsx
&#039;use client&#039;;

import { useChat } from &#039;@ai-sdk/react&#039;;
import {
  Conversation,
  ConversationContent,
} from &#039;@/components/ai-elements/conversation&#039;;
import {
  Message,
  MessageContent,
  MessageResponse,
} from &#039;@/components/ai-elements/message&#039;;

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat();

  return (
    &lt;Conversation&gt;
      &lt;ConversationContent&gt;
        {messages.map((message, index) =&gt; (
          &lt;Message key={index} from={message.role}&gt;
            &lt;MessageContent&gt;
              &lt;MessageResponse&gt;{message.content}&lt;/MessageResponse&gt;
            &lt;/MessageContent&gt;
          &lt;/Message&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/ConversationContent&gt;
    &lt;/Conversation&gt;
  );
}
```

## How It Works

The AI Elements CLI:

1. **Detects your package manager** (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) automatically
2. **Fetches component registry** from `https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/api/registry/registry.json`
3. **Installs components** using the shadcn/ui CLI under the hood
4. **Adds dependencies** and integrates with your existing shadcn/ui setup

Components are installed to your configured shadcn/ui components directory (typically `@/components/ai-elements/`) and become part of your codebase, allowing for full customization.

## Configuration

AI Elements uses your existing shadcn/ui configuration. Components will be installed to the directory specified in your `components.json` file.

## Recommended Setup

For the best experience, we recommend:

1. **AI Gateway**: Set up [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) and add `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` to your `.env.local`
2. **CSS Variables**: Use shadcn/ui&#039;s CSS Variables mode for theming
3. **TypeScript**: Enable TypeScript for better development experience

## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to contribute to AI Elements, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes to the components in `packages/elements`.
4. Open a PR to the `main` branch.

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt (or [set up a rule](#add-a-rule) to auto-invoke):

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies
and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache
JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM&#039;s context. No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t exist, no outdated code generation.

## Installation

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **API Key Recommended**: Get a free API key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;OAuth Authentication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Context7 MCP server supports OAuth 2.0 authentication for MCP clients that implement the [MCP OAuth specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization).

To use OAuth, change the endpoint from `/mcp` to `/mcp/oauth` in your client configuration:

```diff
- &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mcp.context7.com/mcp&quot;
+ &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth&quot;
```

OAuth is only available for remote HTTP connections. For local MCP connections using stdio transport, use API key authentication instead.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Important Tips

### Add a Rule

To avoid typing `use context7` in every prompt, add a rule to your MCP client to automatically invoke Context7 for code-related questions:

- **Cursor**: `Cursor Settings &gt; Rules`
- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md`
- Or the equivalent in your MCP client

**Example rule:**

```txt
Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
```

### Use Library Id

If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.

```txt
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
```

The slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.

### Specify a Version

To get documentation for a specific library version, just mention the version in your prompt:

```txt
How do I set up Next.js 14 middleware? use context7
```

Context7 will automatically match the appropriate version.

## Available Tools

Context7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `query` (required): The user&#039;s question or task (used to rank results by relevance)
  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for

- `query-docs`: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `libraryId` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
  - `query` (required): The question or task to get relevant documentation for

## Release Notes

Our [blog](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/timeline) is regularly updated with release notes and provides a weekly summary.

## Distinctive features

### 1. Data model-driven, not form/table–driven

Instead of being constrained by forms or tables, NocoBase adopts a data model–driven approach, separating data structure from user interface to unlock unlimited possibilities.

- UI and data structure are fully decoupled
- Multiple blocks and actions can be created for the same table or record in any quantity or form
- Supports the main database, external databases, and third-party APIs as data sources

![model](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/model.png)

### 2. AI employees, integrated into your business systems
Unlike standalone AI demos, NocoBase allows you to embed AI capabilities seamlessly into your interfaces, workflows, and data context, making AI truly useful in real business scenarios.

- Define AI employees for roles such as translator, analyst, researcher, or assistant
- Seamless AI–human collaboration in interfaces and workflows
- Ensure AI usage is secure, transparent, and customizable for your business needs

![AI-employee](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/ai-employee-home.png)

### 3. What you see is what you get, incredibly easy to use

While enabling the development of complex business systems, NocoBase keeps the experience simple and intuitive.

- One-click switch between usage mode and configuration mode
- Pages serve as a canvas to arrange blocks and actions, similar to Notion
- Configuration mode is designed for ordinary users, not just programmers

![wysiwyg](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/wysiwyg.gif)

### 4. Everything is a plugin, designed for extension
Adding more no-code features will never cover every business case. NocoBase is built for extension through its plugin-based microkernel architecture.

- All functionalities are plugins, similar to WordPress
- Plugins are ready to use upon installation
- Pages, blocks, actions, APIs, and data sources can all be extended through custom plugins

![plugins](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/plugins.png)

## Installation

NocoBase supports three installation methods:

- &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.nocobase.com/welcome/getting-started/installation/docker-compose&quot;&gt;Installing With Docker (👍Recommended)&lt;/a&gt;

  Suitable for no-code scenarios, no code to write. When upgrading, just download the latest image and reboot.

- &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.nocobase.com/welcome/getting-started/installation/create-nocobase-app&quot;&gt;Installing from create-nocobase-app CLI&lt;/a&gt;

  The business code of the project is completely independent and supports low-code development.

- &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.nocobase.com/welcome/getting-started/installation/git-clone&quot;&gt;Installing from Git source code&lt;/a&gt;

  If you want to experience the latest unreleased version, or want to participate in the contribution, you need to make changes and debug on the source code, it is recommended to choose this installation method, which requires a high level of development skills, and if the code has been updated, you can git pull the latest code.

## 🏠 Self-Hosting Options

Prefer to run n8n-MCP yourself? Choose your deployment method:

### Option A: npx (Quick Local Setup) 🚀

Get n8n-MCP running in minutes:

[![n8n-mcp Video Quickstart Guide](./thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/5CccjiLLyaY?si=Z62SBGlw9G34IQnQ&amp;t=343)

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation needed!)
npx n8n-mcp
```

Add to Claude Desktop config:

&gt; ⚠️ **Important**: The `MCP_MODE: &quot;stdio&quot;` environment variable is **required** for Claude Desktop. Without it, you will see JSON parsing errors like `&quot;Unexpected token...&quot;` in the UI. This variable ensures that only JSON-RPC messages are sent to stdout, preventing debug logs from interfering with the protocol.

**Basic configuration (documentation tools only):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;n8n-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MCP_MODE&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
        &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
        &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT&quot;: &quot;true&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Full configuration (with n8n management tools):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;n8n-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MCP_MODE&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
        &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
        &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT&quot;: &quot;true&quot;,
        &quot;N8N_API_URL&quot;: &quot;https://your-n8n-instance.com&quot;,
        &quot;N8N_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-api-key&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; **Note**: npx will download and run the latest version automatically. The package includes a pre-built database with all n8n node information.

**Configuration file locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Restart Claude Desktop after updating configuration** - That&#039;s it! 🎉

### Option B: Docker (Isolated &amp; Reproducible) 🐳

**Prerequisites:** Docker installed on your system

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📦 Install Docker&lt;/strong&gt; (click to expand)&lt;/summary&gt;

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install --cask docker

# Or download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Add your user to docker group (optional, to run without sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for this to take effect
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Option 1: Using winget (Windows Package Manager)
winget install Docker.DockerDesktop

# Option 2: Using Chocolatey
choco install docker-desktop

# Option 3: Download installer from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
docker --version
```
&lt;/details&gt;

```bash
# Pull the Docker image (~280MB, no n8n dependencies!)
docker pull ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest
```

&gt; **⚡ Ultra-optimized:** Our Docker image is 82% smaller than typical n8n images because it contains NO n8n dependencies - just the runtime MCP server with a pre-built database!

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Basic configuration (documentation tools only):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;MCP_MODE=stdio&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL=error&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Full configuration (with n8n management tools):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;MCP_MODE=stdio&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL=error&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_API_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

&gt;💡 Tip: If you&#039;re running n8n locally on the same machine (e.g., via Docker), use http://host.docker.internal:5678 as the N8N_API_URL.

&gt; **Note**: The n8n API credentials are optional. Without them, you&#039;ll have access to all documentation and validation tools. With them, you&#039;ll additionally get workflow management capabilities (create, update, execute workflows).

### 🏠 Local n8n Instance Configuration

If you&#039;re running n8n locally (e.g., `http://localhost:5678` or Docker), you need to allow localhost webhooks:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;, &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;--rm&quot;, &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;MCP_MODE=stdio&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL=error&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:5678&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;WEBHOOK_SECURITY_MODE=moderate&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; ⚠️ **Important:** Set `WEBHOOK_SECURITY_MODE=moderate` to allow webhooks to your local n8n instance. This is safe for local development while still blocking private networks and cloud metadata.

**Important:** The `-i` flag is required for MCP stdio communication.

&gt; 🔧 If you encounter any issues with Docker, check our [Docker Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

**Configuration file locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Restart Claude Desktop after updating configuration** - That&#039;s it! 🎉

## 🔐 Privacy &amp; Telemetry

n8n-mcp collects anonymous usage statistics to improve the tool. [View our privacy policy](./PRIVACY.md).

### Opting Out

**For npx users:**
```bash
npx n8n-mcp telemetry disable
```

**For Docker users:**
Add the following environment variable to your Docker configuration:
```json
&quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_MCP_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true&quot;
```

Example in Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;MCP_MODE=stdio&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL=error&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_MCP_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true&quot;,

environment:
  N8N_MCP_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: &quot;true&quot;
```

## ⚙️ Database &amp; Memory Configuration

### Database Adapters

n8n-mcp uses SQLite for storing node documentation. Two adapters are available:

1. **better-sqlite3** (Default in Docker)
   - Native C++ bindings for best performance
   - Direct disk writes (no memory overhead)
   - **Now enabled by default** in Docker images (v2.20.2+)
   - Memory usage: ~100-120 MB stable

2. **sql.js** (Fallback)
   - Pure JavaScript implementation
   - In-memory database with periodic saves
   - Used when better-sqlite3 compilation fails
   - Memory usage: ~150-200 MB stable

### Memory Optimization (sql.js)

If using sql.js fallback, you can configure the save interval to balance between data safety and memory efficiency:

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
SQLJS_SAVE_INTERVAL_MS=5000  # Default: 5000ms (5 seconds)
```

**Usage:**
- Controls how long to wait after database changes before saving to disk
- Lower values = more frequent saves = higher memory churn
- Higher values = less frequent saves = lower memory usage
- Minimum: 100ms
- Recommended: 5000-10000ms for production

**Docker Configuration:**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;SQLJS_SAVE_INTERVAL_MS=10000&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**docker-compose:**
```yaml
environment:
  SQLJS_SAVE_INTERVAL_MS: &quot;10000&quot;
```

## 🤖 Claude Project Setup

For the best results when using n8n-MCP with Claude Projects, use these enhanced system instructions:

````markdown
You are an expert in n8n automation software using n8n-MCP tools. Your role is to design, build, and validate n8n workflows with maximum accuracy and efficiency.

## Core Principles

### 1. Silent Execution
CRITICAL: Execute tools without commentary. Only respond AFTER all tools complete.

❌ BAD: &quot;Let me search for Slack nodes... Great! Now let me get details...&quot;
✅ GOOD: [Execute search_nodes and get_node in parallel, then respond]

### 2. Parallel Execution
When operations are independent, execute them in parallel for maximum performance.

✅ GOOD: Call search_nodes, list_nodes, and search_templates simultaneously
❌ BAD: Sequential tool calls (await each one before the next)

### 3. Templates First
ALWAYS check templates before building from scratch (2,709 available).

### 4. Multi-Level Validation
Use validate_node(mode=&#039;minimal&#039;) → validate_node(mode=&#039;full&#039;) → validate_workflow pattern.

### 5. Never Trust Defaults
⚠️ CRITICAL: Default parameter values are the #1 source of runtime failures.
ALWAYS explicitly configure ALL parameters that control node behavior.

## Workflow Process

1. **Start**: Call `tools_documentation()` for best practices

2. **Template Discovery Phase** (FIRST - parallel when searching multiple)
   - `search_templates({searchMode: &#039;by_metadata&#039;, complexity: &#039;simple&#039;})` - Smart filtering
   - `search_templates({searchMode: &#039;by_task&#039;, task: &#039;webhook_processing&#039;})` - Curated by task
   - `search_templates({query: &#039;slack notification&#039;})` - Text search (default searchMode=&#039;keyword&#039;)
   - `search_templates({searchMode: &#039;by_nodes&#039;, nodeTypes: [&#039;n8n-nodes-base.slack&#039;]})` - By node type

   **Filtering strategies**:
   - Beginners: `complexity: &quot;simple&quot;` + `maxSetupMinutes: 30`
   - By role: `targetAudience: &quot;marketers&quot;` | `&quot;developers&quot;` | `&quot;analysts&quot;`
   - By time: `maxSetupMinutes: 15` for quick wins
   - By service: `requiredService: &quot;openai&quot;` for compatibility

3. **Node Discovery** (if no suitable template - parallel execution)
   - Think deeply about requirements. Ask clarifying questions if unclear.
   - `search_nodes({query: &#039;keyword&#039;, includeExamples: true})` - Parallel for multiple nodes
   - `search_nodes({query: &#039;trigger&#039;})` - Browse triggers
   - `search_nodes({query: &#039;AI agent langchain&#039;})` - AI-capable nodes

4. **Configuration Phase** (parallel for multiple nodes)
   - `get_node({nodeType, detail: &#039;standard&#039;, includeExamples: true})` - Essential properties (default)
   - `get_node({nodeType, detail: &#039;minimal&#039;})` - Basic metadata only (~200 tokens)
   - `get_node({nodeType, detail: &#039;full&#039;})` - Complete information (~3000-8000 tokens)
   - `get_node({nodeType, mode: &#039;search_properties&#039;, propertyQuery: &#039;auth&#039;})` - Find specific properties
   - `get_node({nodeType, mode: &#039;docs&#039;})` - Human-readable markdown documentation
   - Show workflow architecture to user for approval before proceeding

5. **Validation Phase** (parallel for multiple nodes)
   - `validate_node({nodeType, config, mode: &#039;minimal&#039;})` - Quick required fields check
   - `validate_node({nodeType, config, mode: &#039;full&#039;, profile: &#039;runtime&#039;})` - Full validation with fixes
   - Fix ALL errors before proceeding

6. **Building Phase**
   - If using template: `get_template(templateId, {mode: &quot;full&quot;})`
   - **MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION**: &quot;Based on template by **[author.name]** (@[username]). View at: [url]&quot;
   - Build from validated configurations
   - ⚠️ EXPLICITLY set ALL parameters - never rely on defaults
   - Connect nodes with proper structure
   - Add error handling
   - Use n8n expressions: $json, $node[&quot;NodeName&quot;].json
   - Build in artifact (unless deploying to n8n instance)

7. **Workflow Validation** (before deployment)
   - `validate_workflow(workflow)` - Complete validation
   - `validate_workflow_connections(workflow)` - Structure chec
