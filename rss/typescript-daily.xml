**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone&#039;s hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn&#039;t trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it&#039;s trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you&#039;re using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the [website](https://handy.computer)
2. Install the application following platform-specific instructions
3. Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## Known Issues &amp; Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited or no support for Wayland display server
- On Wayland the clipboard-based paste options (`Clipboard (CTRL+V)` / `Clipboard (Shift+Insert)`) copy the transcription once, then try to run [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) (preferred) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) to fire the paste keystroke. Install one of these tools to let Handy drive the compositor-friendly paste shortcut; otherwise it falls back to Enigo-generated key events, which may not work on Wayland.

### Linux Notes

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- You can manage global shortcuts outside of Handy and still control the app via signals. Sending `SIGUSR2` to the Handy process toggles recording on/off, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings. Example (Sway):

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy
  ```

  `pkill` here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don&#039;t meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Roadmap &amp; Active Development

We&#039;re actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### In Progress

**Debug Logging:**

- Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues

**macOS Keyboard Improvements:**

- Support for Globe key as transcription trigger
- A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS&#039;s too.

**Opt-in Analytics:**

- Collect anonymous usage data to help improve Handy
- Privacy-first approach with clear opt-in

**Settings Refactoring:**

- Cleanup and refactor settings system which is becoming bloated and messy
- Implement better abstractions for settings management

**Tauri Commands Cleanup:**

- Abstract and organize Tauri command patterns
- Investigate tauri-specta for improved type safety and organization

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Model Installation (For Proxy Users or Network Restrictions)

If you&#039;re behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handy cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.

#### Step 1: Find Your App Data Directory

1. Open Handy settings
2. Navigate to the **About** section
3. Copy the &quot;App Data Directory&quot; path shown there, or use the shortcuts:
   - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D` to open debug menu
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open debug menu

The typical paths are:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.pais.handy/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.pais.handy\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.pais.handy/`

#### Step 2: Create Models Directory

Inside your app data directory, create a `models` folder if it doesn&#039;t already exist:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.pais.handy/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path &quot;$env:APPDATA\com.pais.handy\models&quot;
```

#### Step 3: Download Model Files

Download the models you want from below

**Whisper Models (single .bin files):**

- Small (487 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin`
- Medium (492 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin`
- Turbo (1600 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`
- Large (1100 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin`

**Parakeet Models (compressed archives):**

- V2 (473 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz`
- V3 (478 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Install Models

**For Whisper Models (.bin files):**

Simply place the `.bin` file directly into the `models` directory:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
```

**For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):**

1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Place the **extracted directory** into the `models` folder
3. The directory must be named exactly as follows:
   - **Parakeet V2**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`
   - **Parakeet V3**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`

Final structure should look like:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
```

**Important Notes:**

- For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name **must** match exactly as shown above
- Do not rename the `.bin` files for Whisper models—use the exact filenames from the download URLs
- After placing the files, restart Handy to detect the new models

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Restart Handy
2. Open Settings → Models
3. Your manually installed models should now appear as &quot;Downloaded&quot;
4. Select the model you want to use and test transcription

### Desktop App (BETA)

OpenCode is also available as a desktop application. Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/sst/opencode/releases) or [opencode.ai/download](https://opencode.ai/download).

| Platform              | Download                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel)         | `opencode-desktop-darwin-x64.dmg`     |
| Windows               | `opencode-desktop-windows-x64.exe`    |
| Linux                 | `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage           |

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask opencode-desktop
```

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between,
you can switch between these using the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

Learn more about [agents](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents).

### Documentation

For more info on how to configure OpenCode [**head over to our docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).

### Contributing

If you&#039;re interested in contributing to OpenCode, please read our [contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that&#039;s related to OpenCode and is using &quot;opencode&quot; as a part of its name; for example, &quot;opencode-dashboard&quot; or &quot;opencode-mobile&quot;, please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It&#039;s very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what&#039;s possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What&#039;s the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).

Sonixd is a cross-platform desktop client built for Subsonic-API (and Jellyfin in 0.8.0+) compatible music servers. This project was inspired by the many existing clients, but aimed to address a few key issues including &lt;strong&gt;scalability&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;library management&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;user experience&lt;/strong&gt;.

- [**Usage documentation &amp; FAQ**](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/15)
- [**Theming documentation**](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/61)

Sonixd has been tested on the following: [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome), [Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic), [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced), [Gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic), [Astiga](https://asti.ga/), [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)

### [Demo Sonixd using Navidrome](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/244)

## Features

- HTML5 audio with crossfading and gapless\* playback
- Drag and drop rows with multi-select
- Modify and save playlists intuitively
- Handles large playlists and queues
- Global mediakeys (and partial MPRIS) support
- Multi-theme support
- Supports all Subsonic/Jellyfin API compatible servers
- Built with Electron, React with the [rsuite v4](https://github.com/rsuite/rsuite) component library

&lt;h5&gt;* Gapless playback is artifically created using the crossfading players so it may not be perfect, YMMV.&lt;/h5&gt;

## Install

You can install sonixd by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/releases) for your specified operating system.

---

### Windows

If you prefer not to download the release binary, you can install using `winget`.

Using your favorite terminal (cmd/pwsh):

```
winget install sonixd
```

---

### Arch Linux

There is an AUR package of the latest AppImage release available [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sonixd-appimage).

To install it you can use your favourite AUR package manager and install the package: `sonixd-appimage`

For example using `yay`:

```
yay -S sonixd-appimage
```

If you encounter any problems please comment on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sonixd-appimage) or contact the [maintainer](mailto:robin@blckct.io) directly before you open an issue here.

---

Once installed, run the application and sign in to your music server with the following details. If you are using [airsonic-advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced), you will need to make sure that you create a `decodable` credential for your login user within the admin control panel.

- Server - `e.g. http://localhost:4040/`
- User name - `e.g. admin`
- Password - `e.g. supersecret!`

If you have any questions, feel free to check out the [Usage Documentation &amp; FAQ](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/15).

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

# Installation

## Docker with SQLite

```bash 
docker run -d \
  --name noco \
  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/nocodb:/usr/app/data/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  nocodb/nocodb:latest
  ```

## Docker with PG
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name noco \
  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/nocodb:/usr/app/data/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NC_DB=&quot;pg://host.docker.internal:5432?u=root&amp;p=password&amp;d=d1&quot; \
  -e NC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=&quot;569a1821-0a93-45e8-87ab-eb857f20a010&quot; \
  nocodb/nocodb:latest
```

## Auto-upstall
Auto-upstall is a single command that sets up NocoDB on a server for production usage.
Behind the scenes it auto-generates docker-compose for you.

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) &lt;(mktemp)
```

Auto-upstall does the following: 🕊
- 🐳 Automatically installs all pre-requisites like docker, docker-compose
- 🚀 Automatically installs NocoDB with PostgreSQL, Redis, Minio, Traefik gateway using Docker Compose. 🐘 🗄️ 🌐
- 🔄 Automatically upgrades NocoDB to the latest version when you run the command again.
- 🔒 Automatically setups SSL and also renews it. Needs a domain or subdomain as input while installation.
&gt; install.nocodb.com/noco.sh script can be found [here in our github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocodb/nocodb/develop/docker-compose/1_Auto_Upstall/noco.sh)

# Why are we building this?

Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, abrupt price changes &amp; most importantly a glass ceiling on what&#039;s possible in the future.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases that is open source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on the internet.

# 🤯 Welcome to Activepieces

All-in-one AI automation designed to be **extensible** through a **type-safe** pieces framework written in **TypeScript**.
When you contribute pieces to Activepieces they become automatically available as MCP servers that you can use with LLMs through Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf!

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

## 🔥 Why Activepieces is Different:

- **💖 Loved by Everyone**: Intuitive interface and great experience for both technical and non-technical users with a quick learning curve.

- **🌐 Open Ecosystem:** All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, **60% of the pieces are contributed by the community**.

- **🛠️ Largest open source MCP toolkit**: All our pieces (280+) are available as MCP that you can use with LLMs on Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf.

- **🛠️  Pieces are written in Typescript**: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including **hot reloading** for **local** piece development on your machine. 😎

&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/resources/create-action.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

- **🤖 AI-First**: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK to help you build flows inside the builder.

- **🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

- **🔒 Secure by Design**: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

- **🧠 Human in the Loop**: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨

- **💻 Human Input Interfaces**: Built-in support for human input triggers like &quot;Chat Interface&quot; 💬 and &quot;Form Interface&quot; 📝

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt (or [set up a rule](#️-installation) to auto-invoke):

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies
and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache
JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM&#039;s context. No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don&#039;t exist, no outdated code generation.

## Installation

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **API Key Recommended**: Get a free API key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install in Cursor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Go to: `Settings` -&gt; `Cursor Settings` -&gt; `MCP` -&gt; `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

&gt; Since Cursor 1.0, you can click the install button below for instant one-click installation.

## Important Tips

### Add a Rule

To avoid typing `use context7` in every prompt, add a rule to your MCP client to automatically invoke Context7 for code-related questions:

- **Cursor**: `Cursor Settings &gt; Rules`
- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md`
- Or the equivalent in your MCP client

**Example rule:**

```txt
Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
```

### Use Library Id

If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.

```txt
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
```

The slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.

### Specify a Version

To get documentation for a specific library version, just mention the version in your prompt:

```txt
How do I set up Next.js 14 middleware? use context7
```

Context7 will automatically match the appropriate version.

## Available Tools

Context7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `query` (required): The user&#039;s question or task (used to rank results by relevance)
  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for

- `query-docs`: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `libraryId` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
  - `query` (required): The question or task to get relevant documentation for
