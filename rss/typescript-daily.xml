**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone&#039;s hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn&#039;t trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it&#039;s trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you&#039;re using

The process is entirely local:
- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the [website](https://handy.computer)
2. Install the application following platform-specific instructions
3. Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

            <h2>README</h2><pre># x402 payments protocol

&gt; &quot;1 line of code to accept digital dollars. No fee, 2 second settlement, $0.001 minimum payment.&quot;

```typescript
app.use(
  // How much you want to charge, and where you want the funds to land
  paymentMiddleware(&quot;0xYourAddress&quot;, { &quot;/your-endpoint&quot;: &quot;$0.01&quot; })
);
// That&#039;s it! See examples/typescript/servers/express.ts for a complete example. Instruction below for running on base-sepolia.
```

## Philosophy

Payments on the internet are fundamentally flawed. Credit Cards are high friction, hard to accept, have minimum payments that are far too high, and don&#039;t fit into the programmatic nature of the internet.
It&#039;s time for an open, internet-native form of payments. A payment rail that doesn&#039;t have high minimums + % based fee. Payments that are amazing for humans and AI agents.

## Principles

- **Open standard:** the x402 protocol will never force reliance on a single party
- **HTTP Native:** x402 is meant to seamlessly complement the existing HTTP request made by traditional web services, it should not mandate additional requests outside the scope of a typical client / server flow.
- **Chain and token agnostic:** we welcome contributions that add support for new chains, signing standards, or schemes, so long as they meet our acceptance criteria laid out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Trust minimizing:** all payment schemes must not allow for the facilitator or resource server to move funds, other than in accordance with client intentions
- **Easy to use:** x402 needs to be 10x better than existing ways to pay on the internet. This means abstracting as many details of crypto as possible away from the client and resource server, and into the facilitator. This means the client/server should not need to think about gas, rpc, etc.

## Ecosystem

The x402 ecosystem is growing! Check out our [ecosystem page](https://x402.org/ecosystem) to see projects building with x402, including:

- Client-side integrations
- Services and endpoints
- Ecosystem infrastructure and tooling
- Learning and community resources

Want to add your project to the ecosystem? See our [demo site README](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/typescript/site#adding-your-project-to-the-ecosystem) for detailed instructions on how to submit your project.

**Roadmap:** see [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

## Terms:

- `resource`: Something on the internet. This could be a webpage, file server, RPC service, API, any resource on the internet that accepts HTTP / HTTPS requests.
- `client`: An entity wanting to pay for a resource.
- `facilitator server`: A server that facilitates verification and execution of on-chain payments.
- `resource server`: An HTTP server that provides an API or other resource for a client.

## Technical Goals:

- Permissionless and secure for clients and servers
- Gasless for client and resource servers
- Minimal integration for the resource server and client (1 line for the server, 1 function for the client)
- Ability to trade off speed of response for guarantee of payment
- Extensible to different payment flows and chains

## V1 Protocol

The `x402` protocol is a chain agnostic standard for payments on top of HTTP, leverage the existing `402 Payment Required` HTTP status code to indicate that a payment is required for access to the resource.

It specifies:

1. A schema for how servers can respond to clients to facilitate payment for a resource (`PaymentRequirements`)
2. A standard header `X-PAYMENT` that is set by clients paying for resources
3. A standard schema and encoding method for data in the `X-PAYMENT` header
4. A recommended flow for how payments should be verified and settled by a resource server
5. A REST specification for how a resource server can perform verification and settlement against a remote 3rd party server (`facilitator`)
6. A specification for a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header that can be used by resource servers to communicate blockchain transactions details to the client in their HTTP response

### V1 Protocol Sequencing

![](./static/x402-protocol-flow.png)

The following outlines the flow of a payment using the `x402` protocol. Note that steps (1) and (2) are optional if the client already knows the payment details accepted for a resource.

1. `Client` makes an HTTP request to a `resource server`.

2. `Resource server` responds with a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

3. `Client` selects one of the `paymentRequirements` returned by the server response and creates a `Payment Payload` based on the `scheme` of the `paymentRequirements` they have selected.

4. `Client` sends the HTTP request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the `Payment Payload` to the resource server.

5. `Resource server` verifies the `Payment Payload` is valid either via local verification or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment Requirements` to the `/verify` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

6. `Facilitator server` performs verification of the object based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload` and returns a `Verification Response`.

7. If the `Verification Response` is valid, the resource server performs the work to fulfill the request. If the `Verification Response` is invalid, the resource server returns a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

8. `Resource server` either settles the payment by interacting with a blockchain directly, or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment PaymentRequirements` to the `/settle` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

9. `Facilitator server` submits the payment to the blockchain based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload`.

10. `Facilitator server` waits for the payment to be confirmed on the blockchain.

11. `Facilitator server` returns a `Payment Execution Response` to the resource server.

12. `Resource server` returns a `200 OK` response to the `Client` with the resource they requested as the body of the HTTP response, and a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing the `Settlement Response` as Base64 encoded JSON if the payment was executed successfully.

### Type Specifications

#### Data types

**Payment Required Response**

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: int,

  // List of payment requirements that the resource server accepts. A resource server may accept on multiple chains, or in multiple currencies.
  accepts: [paymentRequirements]

  // Message from the resource server to the client to communicate errors in processing payment
  error: string
}
```

**paymentRequirements**

```json5
{
  // Scheme of the payment protocol to use
  scheme: string;

  // Network of the blockchain to send payment on
  network: string;

  // Maximum amount required to pay for the resource in atomic units of the asset
  maxAmountRequired: uint256 as string;

  // URL of resource to pay for
  resource: string;

  // Description of the resource
  description: string;

  // MIME type of the resource response
  mimeType: string;

  // Output schema of the resource response
  outputSchema?: object | null;

  // Address to pay value to
  payTo: string;

  // Maximum time in seconds for the resource server to respond
  maxTimeoutSeconds: number;

  // Address of the EIP-3009 compliant ERC20 contract
  asset: string;

  // Extra information about the payment details specific to the scheme
  // For `exact` scheme on a EVM network, expects extra to contain the records `name` and `version` pertaining to asset
  extra: object | null;
}
```

**`Payment Payload`** (included as the `X-PAYMENT` header in base64 encoded json)

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: number;

  // scheme is the scheme value of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  scheme: string;

  // network is the network id of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  network: string;

  // payload is scheme dependent
  payload: &lt;scheme dependent&gt;;
}
```

#### Facilitator Types &amp; Interface

A `facilitator server` is a 3rd party service that can be used by a `resource server` to verify and settle payments, without the `resource server` needing to have access to a blockchain node or wallet.

**POST /verify**. Verify a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:
  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    isValid: boolean;
    invalidReason: string | null;
  }
  ```

**POST /settle**. Settle a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:

  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```

- Response:

  ```json5
  {
    // Whether the payment was successful
    success: boolean;

    // Error message from the facilitator server
    error: string | null;

    // Transaction hash of the settled payment
    txHash: string | null;

    // Network id of the blockchain the payment was settled on
    networkId: string | null;
  }
  ```

**GET /supported**. Get supported payment schemes and networks:

- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    kinds: [
      {
        &quot;scheme&quot;: string,
        &quot;network&quot;: string,
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Schemes

A scheme is a logical way of moving money.

Blockchains allow for a large number of flexible ways to move money. To help facilitate an expanding number of payment use cases, the `x402` protocol is extensible to different ways of settling payments via its `scheme` field.

Each payment scheme may have different operational functionality depending on what actions are necessary to fulfill the payment.
For example `exact`, the first scheme shipping as part of the protocol, would have different behavior than `upto`. `exact` transfers a specific amount (ex: pay $1 to read an article), while a theoretical `upto` would transfer up to an amount, based on the resources consumed during a request (ex: generating tokens from an LLM).

See `specs/schemes` for more details on schemes, and see `specs/schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md` to see the first proposed scheme for exact payment on EVM chains.

### Schemes vs Networks

Because a scheme is a logical way of moving money, the way a scheme is implemented can be different for different blockchains. (ex: the way you need to implement `exact` on Ethereum is very different from the way you need to implement `exact` on Solana).

Clients and facilitators must explicitly support different `(scheme, network)` pairs in order to be able to create proper payloads and verify / settle payments.

## Running example

**Requirements:** Node.js v24 or higher

1. From `examples/typescript` run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to ensure all dependent packages and examples are setup.

2. Select a server, i.e. express, and `cd` into that example. Add your server&#039;s ethereum address to get paid to into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

3. Select a client, i.e. axios, and `cd` into that example. Add your private key for the account making payments into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

You should see activities in the client terminal, which will display a weather report.

## Running tests

1. Navigate to the typescript directory: `cd typescript`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the unit tests: `pnpm test`

This will run the unit tests for the x402 packages.

docker build -t chartdb .
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY&gt; -p 8080:80 chartdb
```

#### Using Custom Inference Server

```bash
# Build
docker build \
  --build-arg VITE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=&lt;YOUR_ENDPOINT&gt; \
  --build-arg VITE_LLM_MODEL_NAME=&lt;YOUR_MODEL_NAME&gt; \
  -t chartdb .

# Run
docker run \
  -e OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=&lt;YOUR_ENDPOINT&gt; \
  -e LLM_MODEL_NAME=&lt;YOUR_MODEL_NAME&gt; \
  -p 8080:80 chartdb
```

&gt; **Privacy Note:** ChartDB includes privacy-focused analytics via Fathom Analytics. You can disable this by adding `-e DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true` to the run command or `--build-arg VITE_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true` when building.

&gt; **Note:** You must configure either Option 1 (OpenAI API key) OR Option 2 (Custom endpoint and model name) for AI capabilities to work. Do not mix the two options.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

Example configuration for a local vLLM server:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/v1
VITE_LLM_MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ
```

## Legal

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply contains user-submitted links to publicly available video stream URLs, which to the best of our knowledge have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/pulls) or opening an [issue](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/new?assignees=freearhey&amp;labels=removal+request&amp;template=--removal-request.yml&amp;title=Remove%3A+). However, note that we have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus this is **not** a valid reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from the web, you should contact the web host that&#039;s actually hosting the content (**not** GitHub, nor the maintainers of this repository).

## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 100,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

#### 1. [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

| **Manage applications in one place**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pangolin provides a unified dashboard where you can monitor, configure, and secure all of your services regardless of where they are hosted.                                                                                                                                                                                    | &lt;img src=&quot;public/screenshots/hero.png&quot; width=500 /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; |
| **Reverse proxy across networks anywhere**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Route traffic via tunnels to any private network. Pangolin works like a reverse proxy that spans multiple networks and handles routing, load balancing, health checking, and more to the right services on the other end.                                                                                                  | &lt;img src=&quot;public/screenshots/sites.png&quot; width=500 /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;          |

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Roblox Creator Documentation

This repository holds source code for the creator documentation at [create.roblox.com/docs](https://create.roblox.com/docs).

**Note**: Currently, the repository has guides, tutorials, educational content, and a read-only version of the Engine API reference.

If you&#039;re unfamiliar with the GitHub contribution process, see [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and the following video.

&lt;https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs/assets/84365734/b5d10495-837a-454f-9d96-e01ed44e32c7&gt;

## Reporting Issues

If you find a problem with the documentation and don&#039;t want to submit a pull request, please let us know by [reporting it on the Roblox developer forums](https://devforum.roblox.com/w/bug-report/).

## Contribution Guidelines

Any addition to the Roblox creator documentation has to fit within the larger whole. In other words, even a comprehensive, accurate, well-written blog post or technical whitepaper might not have a home on the website.

Generally speaking, we look for content that conforms to our existing standards and applies to a wide variety of experiences and use cases. For example, we prefer pages like **Building User Interfaces** to pages like **Creating a Speedometer for a Racing Game**. Consider posting more specialized guides to the [Roblox developer forum](https://devforum.roblox.com/c/resources/71).

When you submit a pull request for review, you must agree to the following:

- This contribution was created in whole or in part by me, and I have the right to submit it under the terms of this repository&#039;s open source licenses.
- I understand and agree that this contribution and a record of it are public, maintained indefinitely, and may be redistributed under the terms of this repository&#039;s open source licenses.
- To the best of my knowledge, all proposed changes are accurate.

## Minor Contributions

For simple changes that only touch a single file, use GitHub&#039;s web-based editor:

1. Find the file in `content/en-us/` and click **Edit this file**.
1. Click **Fork this repository**.
1. Make your changes and click **Commit changes...**.
1. Give your change a descriptive commit message and click **Propose changes**.
1. Ensure that the base repository is `Roblox/creator-docs` and the base branch is `main`. Verify that you&#039;re happy with your changes and click **Create pull request**.
1. Finally, fill out the details in the pull request description and click **Create pull request**.

## Larger Contributions

For larger changes that touch multiple files, we recommend github.dev, a more full-featured text editor based on Visual Studio Code that runs in your browser:

1. Fork the repository.
1. While browsing your fork, press the &lt;kbd&gt;.&lt;/kbd&gt; key to open github.dev.
1. In the **Source Control** menu, click **...** &gt; **Branch** &gt; **Create Branch...**.
1. Give the branch a name and click **Switch to Branch**.
1. Use the **Explorer** menu to find the files you want to update in `content/en-us`, and make your desired changes.
1. In the **Source Control** menu, verify that you&#039;re happy with your changes.
1. Add a commit message and click **Commit &amp; Push**.
1. In a new browser tab, navigate to [github.com/Roblox/creator-docs](https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs).
1. Click **Compare &amp; pull request**.
1. Verify that the base repository is `Roblox/creator-docs` and the base branch is `main`. The head repository should be your fork and your branch.
1. Finally, fill out the details in the pull request description and click **Create pull request**.

Alternatively, you can use the **GitHub** or **GitHub Pull Request** menus in github.dev to submit the pull request. For documentation on using github.dev, see [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor).

## Offline Workflow

This repository is extremely large, so we recommend using the online options whenever possible. However, if you&#039;re already familiar with the general GitHub workflow and want to use an offline text editor, here are the basic steps for contributing to the documentation:

1. Set up [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) and [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage). Alternatively, install a Git client like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
1. Fork this repository.
1. Clone your fork.
1. Navigate to the repository root.
1. Create a new branch.
1. Make your desired changes.
1. Commit, push to your fork, and submit your pull request against this repository&#039;s `main` branch.

For more detailed steps, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Document Types

The Roblox documentation has three main document types:

- Conceptual and task-based guides in `.md` files in [content/en-us/](./content/en-us/)

  Guides teach you about a feature or workflow without being overly prescriptive about the end result. They introduce concepts and features and cover the tasks you can accomplish using various tools or other approaches.

  Guides benefit massively from practical, real-world use cases, images, code snippets, and diagrams. Most task-based content should include a numbered list.

- Tutorials in `.md` files in [content/en-us/tutorials](./content/en-us/tutorials)

  Compared to task-based guides, tutorials are more self-contained and take you from _nothing_ to _something_. This focus on creating something specific means they&#039;re typically much more prescriptive than guides. Tutorials often touch multiple features and concepts at the same time, demonstrating the connections between tools and strategies.

- API reference docs in `.yaml` files in [content/en-us/reference](./content/en-us/reference)

  We provide these files so that you can view the source and use them in your own projects, but we **no longer** accept pull requests on the reference `.yaml` files.

If your contribution doesn&#039;t fit within these categories or covers a particularly narrow subject, it might not be a good fit for the documentation. Consider posting it to the [Roblox developer forum](https://devforum.roblox.com/c/resources/71).

## Contribution Basics

Try to limit your edits to one class or feature so that the pull request is easier to review. Bug fixes and smaller improvements have a higher likelihood of fast approval. Large guides often require significant back-and-forth before publication.

To avoid formatting issues, we recommend text editors like github.dev that let you preview Markdown as you write it. For prose, try to follow the guidelines in [STYLE.md](STYLE.md). For code samples, use the [Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/).

To view a page fully formatted per what we see on the `main` branch, replace the entire URL from `content/` and before. Files with the basename `index` should have that name removed. For example, the page for &quot;https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs/blob/main/content/en-us/avatar/index.md&quot; is rendered at &quot;https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/avatar&quot;.

## Licenses

- Code samples are available under the MIT License. For full license text, see [LICENSE-CODE](LICENSE-CODE).

## Beta releases

Beta releases are generated by the [pkg.pr.new](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/pkg.pr.new) tool and are updated on every commit pushed to the `main` branch.

&gt; [!Warning]
&gt; These beta releases get updated over time, so they are ill suited to be used as stable versions for a project (and the proper npm released should be used instead). These should be used only for quick testing of not yet released features/fixes.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Next.js SaaS Starter

This is a starter template for building a SaaS application using **Next.js** with support for authentication, Stripe integration for payments, and a dashboard for logged-in users.

**Demo: [https://next-saas-start.vercel.app/](https://next-saas-start.vercel.app/)**

## Features

- Marketing landing page (`/`) with animated Terminal element
- Pricing page (`/pricing`) which connects to Stripe Checkout
- Dashboard pages with CRUD operations on users/teams
- Basic RBAC with Owner and Member roles
- Subscription management with Stripe Customer Portal
- Email/password authentication with JWTs stored to cookies
- Global middleware to protect logged-in routes
- Local middleware to protect Server Actions or validate Zod schemas
- Activity logging system for any user events

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- **UI Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter
cd saas-starter
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

[Install](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) and log in to your Stripe account:

```bash
stripe login
```

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can also create new users through the `/sign-up` route.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can listen for Stripe webhooks locally through their CLI to handle subscription change events:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

## Testing Payments

To test Stripe payments, use the following test card details:

- Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiration: Any future date
- CVC: Any 3-digit number

## Going to Production

When you&#039;re ready to deploy your SaaS application to production, follow these steps:

### Set up a production Stripe webhook

1. Go to the Stripe Dashboard and create a new webhook for your production environment.
2. Set the endpoint URL to your production API route (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`).
3. Select the events you want to listen for (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`).

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and deploy it.
3. Follow the Vercel deployment process, which will guide you through setting up your project.

### Add environment variables

In your Vercel project settings (or during deployment), add all the necessary environment variables. Make sure to update the values for the production environment, including:

1. `BASE_URL`: Set this to your production domain.
2. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Use your Stripe secret key for the production environment.
3. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Use the webhook secret from the production webhook you created in step 1.
4. `POSTGRES_URL`: Set this to your production database URL.
5. `AUTH_SECRET`: Set this to a random string. `openssl rand -base64 32` will generate one.

## Notification Workflows as Code
For API documentation and reference, please visit [Echo API Reference](https://docs.novu.co/echo/quickstart?utm_campaign=github-readme).

```ts

client.workflow(&#039;comment-on-post&#039;, async ({step, subscriber}) =&gt; {
  const inAppResponse = await step.inApp(&#039;in-app-step&#039;, async (inputs) =&gt; {
    return {
      body: renderReactComponent(inputs)
    };
  }, {
    inputSchema: {
      // ...JSON Schema or ZOD/Ajv/Class Validators definition
    }
  });

  // Novu Worker Engine will manage the state and durability of each step in isolation
  const { events } = await step.digest(&#039;1 day&#039;);

  await step.email(&#039;email-step&#039;, async () =&gt; {
    return {
      subject: &#039;E-mail Subject&#039;,
      body: renderReactEmail(&lt;ReactEmailComponent events={digestedEvents} /&gt;);
    }
  }, {
    // Step-level inputs defined in code and controlled in the novu Cloud UI by a Non-Technical Team member
    inputSchema: {
      // ...JSON Schema
    },
    providers: {
      sendgrid: async (inputs) =&gt; {
        // Echo runs as part of your application, so you have access to your database or resources

        return {
          to: email,
          ipPoolName: &#039;custom-pool&#039;
        };
      }
    },
    skip: () =&gt; {
      // Write custom skip logic
      return inAppResponse.seen || subscriber.isOnline;
    }
  });
// Define your workflow trigger payload using json schema and custom validation;
}, {
  payloadSchema: {
    // ...JSON Schema
  }
});

```

## Embeddable Notification Center

Using the Novu API and admin panel, you can easily add a real-time notification center to your web app without building it yourself. You can use our [React](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/react/get-started?utm_campaign=github-readme) / [Vue](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/vue?utm_campaign=github-readme) / [Angular](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/angular?utm_campaign=github-readme) components or an [iframe embed](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/iframe?utm_campaign=github-readme), as well as a [Web component](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/web-component?utm_campaign=github-readme).

&lt;a name=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
  - At least 20.19.0
  - When using v22 then at least v22.12.0
  - Otherwise any version 23+

```shell
node -v
```

- A MongoDB connection string or Atlas API credentials, **_the Server will not start unless configured_**.
  - **_Service Accounts Atlas API credentials_** are required to use the Atlas tools. You can create a service account in MongoDB Atlas and use its credentials for authentication. See [Atlas API Access](#atlas-api-access) for more details.
  - If you have a MongoDB connection string, you can use it directly to connect to your MongoDB instance.

## Setup

### Quick Start

&gt; **🔒 Security Recommendation 1:** When using Atlas API credentials, be sure to assign only the minimum required permissions to your service account. See [Atlas API Permissions](#atlas-api-permissions) for details.

&gt; **🔒 Security Recommendation 2:** For enhanced security, we strongly recommend using environment variables to pass sensitive configuration such as connection strings and API credentials instead of command line arguments. Command line arguments can be visible in process lists and logged in various system locations, potentially exposing your secrets. Environment variables provide a more secure way to handle sensitive information.

Most MCP clients require a configuration file to be created or modified to add the MCP server.

Note: The configuration file syntax can be different across clients. Please refer to the following links for the latest expected syntax:

- **Windsurf**: https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/mcp
- **VSCode**: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers
- **Claude Desktop**: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user
- **Cursor**: https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol

&gt; **Default Safety Notice:** All examples below include `--readOnly` by default to ensure safe, read-only access to your data. Remove `--readOnly` if you need to enable write operations.

#### Option 1: Connection String

You can pass your connection string via environment variables, make sure to use a valid username and password.

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;MongoDB&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;mongodb-mcp-server@latest&quot;, &quot;--readOnly&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING&quot;: &quot;mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: The connection string can be configured to connect to any MongoDB cluster, whether it&#039;s a local instance or an Atlas cluster.

#### Option 2: Atlas API Credentials

Use your Atlas API Service Accounts credentials. Must follow all the steps in [Atlas API Access](#atlas-api-access) section.

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;MongoDB&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;mongodb-mcp-server@latest&quot;, &quot;--readOnly&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID&quot;: &quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-id&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET&quot;: &quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-secret&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Standalone Service using environment variables and command line arguments

You can source environment variables defined in a config file or explicitly set them like we do in the example below and run the server via npx.

```shell
# Set your credentials as environment variables first
export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID=&quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-id&quot;
export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET=&quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-secret&quot;

# Then start the server
npx -y mongodb-mcp-server@latest --readOnly
```

&gt; **💡 Platform Note:** The examples above use Unix/Linux/macOS syntax. For Windows users, see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for platform-specific instructions.

- For a complete list of configuration options see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)
- To configure your Atlas Service Accounts credentials please refer to [Atlas API Access](#atlas-api-access)
- Connection String via environment variables in the MCP file [example](#connection-string-with-environment-variables)
- Atlas API credentials via environment variables in the MCP file [example](#atlas-api-credentials-with-environment-variables)

#### Option 4: Using Docker

You can run the MongoDB MCP Server in a Docker container, which provides isolation and doesn&#039;t require a local Node.js installation.

#### Run with Environment Variables

You may provide either a MongoDB connection string OR Atlas API credentials:

##### Option A: No configuration

```shell
docker run --rm -i \
  mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:latest
```

##### Option B: With MongoDB connection string

```shell
# Set your credentials as environment variables first
export MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING=&quot;mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/myDatabase&quot;

# Then start the docker container
docker run --rm -i \
  -e MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING \
  -e MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=&quot;true&quot; \
  mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:latest
```

&gt; **💡 Platform Note:** The examples above use Unix/Linux/macOS syntax. For Windows users, see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for platform-specific instructions.

##### Option C: With Atlas API credentials

```shell
# Set your credentials as environment variables first
export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID=&quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-id&quot;
export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET=&quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-secret&quot;

# Then start the docker container
docker run --rm -i \
  -e MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID \
  -e MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -e MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=&quot;true&quot; \
  mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:latest
```

&gt; **💡 Platform Note:** The examples above use Unix/Linux/macOS syntax. For Windows users, see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for platform-specific instructions.

##### Docker in MCP Configuration File

Without options:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;MongoDB&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=true&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

With connection string:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;MongoDB&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=true&quot;,
        &quot;mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:latest&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING&quot;: &quot;mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/myDatabase&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With Atlas API credentials:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;MongoDB&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=true&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET&quot;,
        &quot;mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:latest&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID&quot;: &quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-id&quot;,
        &quot;MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET&quot;: &quot;your-atlas-service-accounts-client-secret&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 5: Running as an HTTP Server

&gt; **⚠️ Security Notice:** This server now supports Streamable HTTP transport for remote connections. **HTTP transport is NOT recommended for production use without implementing proper authentication and security measures.**

**Suggested Security Measures Examples:**

- Implement authentication (e.g., API gateway, reverse proxy)
- Use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Deploy behind a firewall or in private networks
- Implement rate limiting
- Never expose directly to the internet

For more details, see [MCP Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#security-considerations).

You can run the MongoDB MCP Server as an HTTP server instead of the default stdio transport. This is useful if you want to interact with the server over HTTP, for example from a web client or to expose the server on a specific port.

To start the server with HTTP transport, use the `--transport http` option:

```shell
npx -y mongodb-mcp-server@latest --transport http
```

By default, the server will listen on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. You can customize the host and port using the `--httpHost` and `--httpPort` options:

```shell
npx -y mongodb-mcp-server@latest --transport http --httpHost=0.0.0.0 --httpPort=8080
```

- `--httpHost` (default: 127.0.0.1): The host to bind the HTTP server.
- `--httpPort` (default: 3000): The port number for the HTTP server.

&gt; **Note:** The default transport is `stdio`, which is suitable for integration with most MCP clients. Use `http` transport if you need to interact with the server over HTTP.

- `debug` - Debugging information for MongoDB connectivity issues. Tracks the last connectivity attempt and error information. The resource can be accessed under URI `debug://mongodb`.
- `exported-data` - A resource template to access the data exported using the export tool. The template can be accessed under URI `exported-data://{exportName}` where `exportName` is the unique name for an export generated by the export tool.

## Configuration

&gt; **🔒 Security Best Practice:** We strongly recommend using environment variables for sensitive configuration such as API credentials (`MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID`, `MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET`) and connection strings (`MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING`) instead of command-line arguments. Environment variables are not visible in process lists and provide better security for your sensitive data.

The MongoDB MCP Server can be configured using multiple methods, with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Command-line arguments

    &lt;h1&gt;Zigbee2MQTT  🌉 🐝&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Allows you to use your Zigbee devices &lt;b&gt;without&lt;/b&gt; the vendor&#039;s bridge or gateway.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via MQTT. In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## [Getting started](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/getting-started)

The [documentation](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) provides you all the information needed to get up and running! Make sure you don&#039;t skip sections if this is your first visit, as there might be important details in there for you.

If you aren&#039;t familiar with **Zigbee** terminology make sure you [read this](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/zigbee/01_zigbee_network.html) to help you out.

## [Integrations](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/integrations.html)

Zigbee2MQTT integrates well with (almost) every home automation solution because it uses MQTT. However the following integrations are worth mentioning:

### [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;75px&quot; width=&quot;75px&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7738048/40914297-49e6e560-6800-11e8-8904-36cce896e5a8.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br clear=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

[Home Assistant OS](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) using [the official addon](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt) ([other installations](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/integrations/home_assistant.html))

## Architecture

![Architecture](images/architecture-new.png)

### Internal Architecture

Zigbee2MQTT is made up of three modules, each developed in its own Github project. Starting from the hardware (adapter) and moving up; [zigbee-herdsman](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman) connects to your adapter to handle Zigbee communication and makes an API available to the higher levels of the stack. For e.g. Texas Instruments hardware, zigbee-herdsman uses the [TI zStack monitoring and test API](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/wiki/References#texas-instruments-zstack) to communicate with the adapter. The module [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters) handles the mapping from individual device models to the Zigbee clusters they support. [Zigbee clusters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/wiki/References#csa-zigbee-alliance-spec) are the layers of the Zigbee protocol on top of the base protocol that define things like how lights, sensors and switches talk to each other over the Zigbee network. Finally, the Zigbee2MQTT module drives zigbee-herdsman and maps the zigbee messages to MQTT messages. Zigbee2MQTT also keeps track of the state of the system. It uses a `database.db` file to store this state; a text file with a JSON database of connected devices and their capabilities. Zigbee2MQTT provides several web-based interfaces ([zigbee2mqtt-frontend](https://github.com/nurikk/zigbee2mqtt-frontend), [zigbee2mqtt-windfront](https://github.com/Nerivec/zigbee2mqtt-windfront)) that allows monitoring and configuration.

### Developing

Zigbee2MQTT uses TypeScript. Therefore after making changes to files in the `lib/` directory you need to recompile Zigbee2MQTT. This can be done by executing `pnpm run build`. For faster development instead of running `pnpm run build` you can run `pnpm run build-watch` in another terminal session, this will recompile as you change files.

Before running any of the commands, you&#039;ll first need to run `pnpm install --include=dev`.
Before submitting changes run `pnpm run check:w` then `pnpm run test:coverage`.

## Supported devices

See [Supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices) to check whether your device is supported. There is quite an extensive list, including devices from vendors like [Xiaomi](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Xiaomi), [Ikea](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=IKEA), [Philips](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Philips), [OSRAM](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=OSRAM) and more.

If it&#039;s not listed in [Supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices), support can be added (fairly) easily, see [How to support new devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/support-new-devices/01_support_new_devices.html).

## Support &amp; help

If you need assistance you can check [opened issues](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues). Feel free to help with Pull Requests when you were able to fix things or add new devices or just share the love on social media.
