## What is a Desktop Agent?

A desktop agent is an AI that has its own computer. Unlike browser-only agents or traditional RPA tools, Bytebot comes with a full virtual desktop where it can:

- Use any application (browsers, email clients, office tools, IDEs)
- Download and organize files with its own file system
- Log into websites and applications using password managers
- Read and process documents, PDFs, and spreadsheets
- Complete complex multi-step workflows across different programs

Think of it as a virtual employee with their own computer who can see the screen, move the mouse, type on the keyboard, and complete tasks just like a human would.

## Why Give AI Its Own Computer?

When AI has access to a complete desktop environment, it unlocks capabilities that aren&#039;t possible with browser-only agents or API integrations:

### Complete Task Autonomy

Give Bytebot a task like &quot;Download all invoices from our vendor portals and organize them into a folder&quot; and it will:

- Open the browser
- Navigate to each portal
- Handle authentication (including 2FA via password managers)
- Download the files to its local file system
- Organize them into a folder

### Process Documents

Upload files directly to Bytebot&#039;s desktop and it can:

- Read entire PDFs into its context
- Extract data from complex documents
- Cross-reference information across multiple files
- Create new documents based on analysis
- Handle formats that APIs can&#039;t access

### Use Real Applications

Bytebot isn&#039;t limited to web interfaces. It can:

- Use desktop applications like text editors, VS Code, or email clients
- Run scripts and command-line tools
- Install new software as needed
- Configure applications for specific workflows

## Quick Start

### Deploy in 2 Minutes

**Option 1: Railway (Easiest)**
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/bytebot?referralCode=L9lKXQ)

Just click and add your AI provider API key.

**Option 2: Docker Compose**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytebot-ai/bytebot.git
cd bytebot

# Add your AI provider key (choose one)
echo &quot;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...&quot; &gt; docker/.env
# Or: echo &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...&quot; &gt; docker/.env
# Or: echo &quot;GEMINI_API_KEY=...&quot; &gt; docker/.env

docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Open http://localhost:9992
```

[Full deployment guide ‚Üí](https://docs.bytebot.ai/quickstart)

## How It Works

Bytebot consists of four integrated components:

1. **Virtual Desktop**: A complete Ubuntu Linux environment with pre-installed applications
2. **AI Agent**: Understands your tasks and controls the desktop to complete them
3. **Task Interface**: Web UI where you create tasks and watch Bytebot work
4. **APIs**: REST endpoints for programmatic task creation and desktop control

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Tasks**: Just describe what you need done
- **File Uploads**: Drop files onto tasks for Bytebot to process
- **Live Desktop View**: Watch Bytebot work in real-time
- **Takeover Mode**: Take control when you need to help or configure something
- **Password Manager Support**: Install 1Password, Bitwarden, etc. for automatic authentication
- **Persistent Environment**: Install programs and they stay available for future tasks

## Example Tasks

### Basic Examples

```
&quot;Go to Wikipedia and create a summary of quantum computing&quot;
&quot;Research flights from NYC to London and create a comparison document&quot;
&quot;Take screenshots of the top 5 news websites&quot;
```

### Document Processing

```
&quot;Read the uploaded contracts.pdf and extract all payment terms and deadlines&quot;
&quot;Process these 5 invoice PDFs and create a summary report&quot;
&quot;Download and analyze the latest financial report and answer: What were the key risks mentioned?&quot;
```

### Multi-Application Workflows

```
&quot;Download last month&#039;s bank statements from our three banks and consolidate them&quot;
&quot;Check all our vendor portals for new invoices and create a summary report&quot;
&quot;Log into our CRM, export the customer list, and update records in the ERP system&quot;
```

## Programmatic Control

### Create Tasks via API

```python
import requests

# Simple task
response = requests.post(&#039;http://localhost:9991/tasks&#039;, json={
    &#039;description&#039;: &#039;Download the latest sales report and create a summary&#039;
})

# Task with file upload
files = {&#039;files&#039;: open(&#039;contracts.pdf&#039;, &#039;rb&#039;)}
response = requests.post(&#039;http://localhost:9991/tasks&#039;,
    data={&#039;description&#039;: &#039;Review these contracts for important dates&#039;},
    files=files
)
```

### Direct Desktop Control

```bash
# Take a screenshot
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/computer-use \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;screenshot&quot;}&#039;

# Click at specific coordinates
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/computer-use \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -d &#039;{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;click_mouse&quot;, &quot;coordinate&quot;: [500, 300]}&#039;
```

## Evolution API

Evolution API began as a WhatsApp controller API based on [CodeChat](https://github.com/code-chat-br/whatsapp-api), which in turn implemented the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library. While originally focused on WhatsApp, Evolution API has grown into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple messaging services and integrations. We continue to acknowledge CodeChat for laying the groundwork.

Today, Evolution API is not limited to WhatsApp. It integrates with various platforms such as Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, and OpenAI, offering a broad array of functionalities beyond messaging. Evolution API supports both the Baileys-based WhatsApp API and the official WhatsApp Business API, with upcoming support for Instagram and Messenger.

## Looking for a Lightweight Version?
For those who need a more streamlined and performance-optimized version, check out [Evolution API Lite](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api-lite). It&#039;s designed specifically for microservices, focusing solely on connectivity without integrations or audio conversion features. Ideal for environments that prioritize simplicity and efficiency.

## Types of Connections

Evolution API supports multiple types of connections to WhatsApp, enabling flexible and powerful integration options:

- *WhatsApp API - Baileys*:
  - A free API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).
  - This connection type allows control over WhatsApp Web functionalities through a RESTful API, suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, and other WhatsApp-integrated systems.
  - Note: This method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.

- *WhatsApp Cloud API*:
  - The official API provided by Meta (formerly Facebook).
  - This connection type offers a robust and reliable solution designed for businesses needing higher volumes of messaging and better integration support.
  - The Cloud API supports features such as end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive customer service tools.
  - To use this API, you must comply with Meta&#039;s policies and potentially pay for usage based on message volume and other factors.

## Integrations

Evolution API supports various integrations to enhance its functionality. Below is a list of available integrations and their uses:

- [Typebot](https://typebot.io/):
  - Build conversational bots using Typebot, integrated directly into Evolution with trigger management.

- [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/):
  - Direct integration with Chatwoot for handling customer service for your business.

- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/):
  - Receive events from the Evolution API via RabbitMQ.

- [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/sqs/):
  - Receive events from the Evolution API via Amazon SQS.

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/):
  - Receive events from the Evolution API via WebSocket.

- [Dify](https://dify.ai/):
  - Integrate your Evolution API directly with Dify AI for seamless trigger management and multiple agents.

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/):
  - Integrate your Evolution API with OpenAI for AI capabilities, including audio-to-text conversion, available across all Evolution integrations.

- Amazon S3 / Minio:
  - Store media files received in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/) or [Minio](https://min.io/).

## Telemetry Notice

To continuously improve our services, we have implemented telemetry that collects data on the routes used, the most accessed routes, and the version of the API in use. We would like to assure you that no sensitive or personal data is collected during this process. The telemetry helps us identify improvements and provide a better experience for users.

Dify is an open-source platform for developing LLM applications. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflows, RAG pipelines, agent capabilities, model management, observability features, and more‚Äîallowing you to quickly move from prototype to production.

## Quick start

&gt; Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
&gt;
&gt; - CPU &gt;= 2 Core
&gt; - RAM &gt;= 4 GiB

&lt;/br&gt;

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [Docker Compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

#### Seeking help

## How To Use It

You can **just fork or clone** this repository and use it as is.

‚ú® It just works. ‚ú®

### How to Use a Private Repository

If you want to have a private repository, GitHub won&#039;t allow you to simply fork it as it doesn&#039;t allow changing the visibility of forks.

But you can do the following:

- Create a new GitHub repo, for example `my-full-stack`.
- Clone this repository manually, set the name with the name of the project you want to use, for example `my-full-stack`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git my-full-stack
```

- Enter into the new directory:

```bash
cd my-full-stack
```

- Set the new origin to your new repository, copy it from the GitHub interface, for example:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git
```

- Add this repo as another &quot;remote&quot; to allow you to get updates later:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git
```

- Push the code to your new repository:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Update From the Original Template

After cloning the repository, and after doing changes, you might want to get the latest changes from this original template.

- Make sure you added the original repository as a remote, you can check it with:

```bash
git remote -v

origin    git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git (push)
```

- Pull the latest changes without merging:

```bash
git pull --no-commit upstream master
```

This will download the latest changes from this template without committing them, that way you can check everything is right before committing.

- If there are conflicts, solve them in your editor.

- Once you are done, commit the changes:

```bash
git merge --continue
```

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c &quot;import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))&quot;
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

## How To Use It - Alternative With Copier

This repository also supports generating a new project using [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io).

It will copy all the files, ask you configuration questions, and update the `.env` files with your answers.

### Install Copier

You can install Copier with:

```bash
pip install copier
```

Or better, if you have [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/), you can run it with:

```bash
pipx install copier
```

**Note**: If you have `pipx`, installing copier is optional, you could run it directly.

### Generate a Project With Copier

Decide a name for your new project&#039;s directory, you will use it below. For example, `my-awesome-project`.

Go to the directory that will be the parent of your project, and run the command with your project&#039;s name:

```bash
copier copy https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template my-awesome-project --trust
```

If you have `pipx` and you didn&#039;t install `copier`, you can run it directly:

```bash
pipx run copier copy https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template my-awesome-project --trust
```

**Note** the `--trust` option is necessary to be able to execute a [post-creation script](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/.copier/update_dotenv.py) that updates your `.env` files.

### Input Variables

Copier will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project.

But don&#039;t worry, you can just update any of that in the `.env` files afterwards.

The input variables, with their default values (some auto generated) are:

- `project_name`: (default: `&quot;FastAPI Project&quot;`) The name of the project, shown to API users (in .env).
- `stack_name`: (default: `&quot;fastapi-project&quot;`) The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name (no spaces, no periods) (in .env).
- `secret_key`: (default: `&quot;changethis&quot;`) The secret key for the project, used for security, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above.
- `first_superuser`: (default: `&quot;admin@example.com&quot;`) The email of the first superuser (in .env).
- `first_superuser_password`: (default: `&quot;changethis&quot;`) The password of the first superuser (in .env).
- `smtp_host`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The SMTP server host to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `smtp_user`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The SMTP server user to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `smtp_password`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The SMTP server password to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `emails_from_email`: (default: `&quot;info@example.com&quot;`) The email account to send emails from, you can set it later in .env.
- `postgres_password`: (default: `&quot;changethis&quot;`) The password for the PostgreSQL database, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above.
- `sentry_dsn`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it, you can set it later in .env.

# Frigate - NVR With Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras

&lt;a href=&quot;https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/frigate-nvr/&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/frigate-nvr/language-badge.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Translation status&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

\[English\] | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/dev/README_CN.md)

A complete and local NVR designed for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a GPU or AI accelerator such as a [Google Coral](https://coral.ai/products/) or [Hailo](https://hailo.ai/) is highly recommended. AI accelerators will outperform even the best CPUs with very little overhead.

- Tight integration with Home Assistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
- WebRTC &amp; MSE support for low-latency live view

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Grist

Grist is a modern relational spreadsheet. It combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the robustness of a database.

* `grist-core` (this repo) has what you need to run a powerful server for hosting spreadsheets.

* [`grist-desktop`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop) is a Linux/macOS/Windows desktop app for viewing and editing spreadsheets stored locally.
* [`grist-static`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-static) is a fully in-browser build of Grist for displaying spreadsheets on a website without back-end support.

Grist is developed by [Grist Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grist-labs/), an NYC-based company üá∫üá∏üóΩ. The French government üá´üá∑ organizations [ANCT Donn√©es et Territoires](https://donnees.incubateur.anct.gouv.fr/toolbox/grist) and [DINUM (Direction Interminist√©rielle du Num√©rique)](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/dinum/) have also made significant contributions to the codebase.

The `grist-core`, `grist-desktop`, and `grist-static` repositories are all open source (Apache License, Version 2.0).
Grist Labs offers free and paid hosted services at [getgrist.com](https://getgrist.com), sells an Enterprise product,
and offers [cloud packaging](https://support.getgrist.com/install/grist-builder-edition/).

## Features in `grist-core`

To see exactly what is present in `grist-core`, you can run the [desktop app](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop), or use [`docker`](#using-grist). The absolute fastest way to try Grist out is to visit [docs.getgrist.com](https://docs.getgrist.com) and play with a spreadsheet there immediately ‚Äì¬†though if you do, please read the list of [extra extensions](#features-not-in-grist-core) that are not in `grist-core`.

However you try it, you&#039;ll quickly see that Grist is a hybrid database/spreadsheet, meaning that:

  - Columns work like they do in databases: they are named, and they hold one kind of data.
  - Columns can be filled by formula, spreadsheet-style, with automatic updates when referenced cells change.

This difference can confuse people coming directly from Excel or Google Sheets. Give it a chance! There&#039;s also a [Grist for Spreadsheet Users](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-for-spreadsheet-users/) article to help get you oriented. If you&#039;re coming from Airtable, you&#039;ll find the model familiar (and there&#039;s also our [Grist vs Airtable](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-v-airtable/) article for a direct comparison).

Here are some specific feature highlights of Grist:

  * Python formulas.
    - Full [Python syntax is supported](https://support.getgrist.com/formulas/#python), including the standard library.
    - Many [Excel functions](https://support.getgrist.com/functions/) also available.
    - An [AI Assistant](https://www.getgrist.com/ai-formula-assistant/) specifically tuned for formula generation (using OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo or [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python&quot;&gt;llama-cpp-python&lt;/a&gt;).
  * A portable, self-contained format.
    - Based on SQLite, the most widely deployed database engine.
    - Any tool that can read SQLite can read numeric and text data from a Grist file.
    - Enables [backups](https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document) that you can confidently restore in full.
    - Great for moving between different hosts.
  * Can be displayed on a static website with [`grist-static`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-static) ‚Äì no special server needed.
  * A self-contained desktop app for viewing and editing locally: [`grist-desktop`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop).
  * Convenient editing and formatting features.
    - Choices and [choice lists](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#choice-list-columns), for adding colorful tags to records.
    - [References](https://support.getgrist.com/col-refs/#creating-a-new-reference-list-column) and reference lists, for cross-referencing records in other tables.
    - [Attachments](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns), to include media or document files in records.
    - Dates and times, toggles, and special numerics such as currency all have specialized editors and formatting options.
    - [Conditional Formatting](https://support.getgrist.com/conditional-formatting/), letting you control the style of cells with formulas to draw attention to important information.
  * Drag-and-drop dashboards.
    - [Charts](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-chart/), [card views](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-card/) and a [calendar widget](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-calendar/) for visualization.
    - [Summary tables](https://support.getgrist.com/summary-tables/) for summing and counting across groups.
    - [Widget linking](https://support.getgrist.com/linking-widgets/) streamlines filtering and editing data.
    Grist has a unique approach to visualization, where you can lay out and link distinct widgets to show together,
    without cramming mixed material into a table.
    - [Filter bar](https://support.getgrist.com/search-sort-filter/#filter-buttons) for quick slicing and dicing.
  * [Incremental imports](https://support.getgrist.com/imports/#updating-existing-records).
    - Import a CSV of the last three months activity from your bank...
    - ...and import new activity a month later without fuss or duplication.

## Features not in `grist-core`

If you evaluate Grist by using the hosted version at [getgrist.com](https://getgrist.com), be aware that it includes some extensions to Grist that aren&#039;t present in `grist-core`. To be sure you&#039;re seeing exactly what is present in `grist-core`, you can run the [desktop app](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-desktop), or use [`docker`](#using-grist). Here is a list of features you may see in Grist Labs&#039; hosting or Enterprise offerings that are not in `grist-core`, in chronological order of creation. If self-hosting, you can get access to a free trial of all of them using the Enterprise toggle on the [Admin Panel](https://support.getgrist.com/admin-panel/).

  * [GristConnect](https://support.getgrist.com/install/grist-connect/) (2022)
    - Any site that has plugins for letting Discourse use its logins (such as WordPress) can also let Grist use its logins.
    - GristConnect is a niche feature built for a specific client which you probably don&#039;t care about ‚Äì `OIDC` and `SAML` support *is* part of `grist-core` and covers most authentication use cases.
  * [Azure back-end for document storage](https://support.getgrist.com/install/cloud-storage/#azure) (2022)
    - With `grist-core` you can store document versions in anything S3-compatible, which covers a lot of services, but not Azure specifically. The Azure back-end fills that gap.
    - Unless you are a Microsoft shop you probably don&#039;t care about this.
  * [Audit log streaming](https://support.getgrist.com/install/audit-log-streaming/) (2024)
    - With `grist-core` a lot of useful information is logged, but not organized specifically with auditing in mind. Audit log streaming supplies that organization, and a UI for setting things up.
    - Enterprises may care about this.
  * [Advanced Admin Controls](https://support.getgrist.com/admin-controls/) (2025)
    - This is a special page for a Grist installation administrator to monitor and edit user access to resources.
	- It uses a special set of administrative endpoints not present on `grist-core`.
	- If you&#039;re going to be running a large Grist installation, with employees coming and going, you may care about this.
  * [Grist Assistant](https://support.getgrist.com/assistant/#assistant) (2025)
    - An AI Formula Assistant - limited to working with formulas - is present in `grist-core`, but the newer Assistant can help with a wider range of tasks like building tables and dashboards and modifying data.
    - If you have many users who need help building documents or working with data, you may care about this one.
  * [Invite Notifications](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-set-up-email-notifications) (2025)
    - When a user is added to a document, or a workspace, or a site, with email notifications they will get emailed a link to access the resource.
	- This link isn&#039;t special, with `grist-core` you can just send a link yourself or a colleague.
	- For a big Grist installation with users who aren&#039;t in close communication, emails might be nice? Hard to guess if you&#039;ll care about this one.
  * [Document Change and Comment Notifications](https://support.getgrist.com/document-settings/#notifications) (2025)
    - You can achieve change notifications in `grist-core` using webhooks, but it is less convenient.
	- People have been asking for this one for years. If you need an excuse to get your boss to pay for Grist, this might finally be the one that works?

## Using Grist

To get the default version of `grist-core` running on your computer
with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), do:

```sh
docker pull gristlabs/grist
docker run -p 8484:8484 -it gristlabs/grist
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8484` in your browser. You&#039;ll be able to create, edit, import,
and export documents. To preserve your work across docker runs, share a directory as `/persist`:

```sh
docker run -p 8484:8484 -v $PWD/persist:/persist -it gristlabs/grist
```

Get templates at [templates.getgrist.com](https://templates.getgrist.com) for payroll,
inventory management, invoicing, D&amp;D encounter tracking, and a lot
more, or use any document you&#039;ve created on
[docs.getgrist.com](https://docs.getgrist.com).

If you need to change the port Grist runs on, set a `PORT` variable, don&#039;t just change the
port mapping:

```
docker run --env PORT=9999 -p 9999:9999 -v $PWD/persist:/persist -it gristlabs/grist
```

To enable gVisor sandboxing, set `--env GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=gvisor`.
This should work with default docker settings, but may not work in all
environments.

You can find a lot more about configuring Grist, setting up authentication,
and running it on a public server in our
[Self-Managed Grist](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/) handbook.

## Using Grist with OpenRouter for Model Agnostic and Claude Support

(Instructions contributed by @lshalon)

Grist&#039;s AI Formula Assistant can be configured to use OpenRouter instead of connecting directly to OpenAI, allowing you to access a wide range of AI models including Anthropic&#039;s Claude models. This isn&#039;t the only way to use Claude models, but it&#039;s a good option if you want to use Claude models with Grist or intend to use other cheaper, faster, or potentially newer models. That&#039;s because this configuration gives you more flexibility in choosing the AI model that works best for your formula generation needs.
To set up OpenRouter integration, configure the following environment variables:

### Required: Set the endpoint to OpenRouter&#039;s API

```
ASSISTANT_CHAT_COMPLETION_ENDPOINT=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
```

### Required: Your OpenRouter API key

```
ASSISTANT_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

Sign up for an OpenRouter API key at &lt;https://openrouter.ai/&gt;

### Optional: Specify which model to use (examples below)

```
ASSISTANT_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
```

### or other options like

```
ASSISTANT_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-r1-zero:free
```

```
ASSISTANT_MODEL=qwen/qwq-32b:free
```

```
ASSISTANT_MODEL=mistralai/mistral-saba
```

### Optional: Set a larger context model for fallback

```
ASSISTANT_LONGER_CONTEXT_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229
```

With this configuration, Grist&#039;s AI Formula Assistant will route requests through OpenRouter to your specified model. This allows you to:

Access Anthropic&#039;s Claude models which excel at understanding context and generating accurate formulas
Switch between different AI models without changing your Grist configuration
Take advantage of OpenRouter&#039;s routing capabilities to optimize for cost, speed, or quality

You can find the available models and their identifiers on the OpenRouter website.
Note: Make sure not to set the OPENAI_API_KEY variable when using OpenRouter, as this would override the OpenRouter configuration.


## Available Docker images

The default Docker image is `gristlabs/grist`. This contains all of
the standard Grist functionality, as well as extra source-available
code for enterprise customers taken from the
[grist-ee](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-ee) repository. This
extra code is not under a free or open source license. By default,
however, the code from the `grist-ee` repository is completely inert
and inactive. This code becomes active only when enabled from the
administrator panel.

If you would rather use an image that contains exclusively free and
open source code, the `gristlabs/grist-oss` Docker image is available
for this purpose. It is by default functionally equivalent to the
`gristlabs/grist` image.

## The administrator panel

You can turn on a special admininistrator panel to inspect the status
of your installation. Just visit `/admin` on your Grist server for
instructions. Since it is useful for the admin panel to be
available even when authentication isn&#039;t set up, you can give it a
special access key by setting `GRIST_BOOT_KEY`.

```
docker run -p 8484:8484 -e GRIST_BOOT_KEY=secret -it gristlabs/grist
```

The boot page should then be available at
`/admin?boot-key=&lt;GRIST_BOOT_KEY&gt;`. We are collecting probes for
common problems there. If you hit a problem that isn&#039;t covered, it
would be great if you could add a probe for it in
[BootProbes](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/blob/main/app/server/lib/BootProbes.ts).
You may instead file an issue so someone else can add it.

## Building from source

To build Grist from source, follow these steps:

    yarn install
    yarn run build
    yarn run install:python
    yarn start
    # Grist will be available at http://localhost:8484/

Grist formulas in documents will be run using Python executed directly on your
machine. You can configure sandboxing using a `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR`
environment variable.

 * On macOS, `export GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=macSandboxExec`
   uses the native `sandbox-exec` command for sandboxing.
 * On Linux with [gVisor&#039;s runsc](https://github.com/google/gvisor)
   installed, `export GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=gvisor` is an option.
 * On any OS including Windows, `export GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=pyodide` is available.

These sandboxing methods have been written for our own use at Grist Labs and
may need tweaking to work in your own environment - pull requests
very welcome here!

## Logins

Like git, Grist has features to track document revision history. So for full operation,
Grist expects to know who the user modifying a document is. Until it does, it operates
in a limited anonymous mode. To get you going, the docker image is configured so that
when you click on the &quot;sign in&quot; button Grist will attribute your work to `you@example.com`.
Change this by setting `GRIST_DEFAULT_EMAIL`:

```
docker run --env GRIST_DEFAULT_EMAIL=my@email -p 8484:8484 -v $PWD/persist:/persist -it gristlabs/grist
```

You can change your name in `Profile Settings` in
the [User Menu](https://support.getgrist.com/glossary/#user-menu).

For multi-user operation, or if you wish to access Grist across the
public internet, you&#039;ll want to connect it to your own Single Sign-On service.
There are a lot of ways to do this, including [SAML and forward authentication](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-set-up-authentication).
Grist has been tested with [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/),
and Google/Microsoft sign-ins via [Dex](https://dexidp.io/).

## Why free and open source software

This repository, `grist-core`, is maintained by Grist Labs. Our flagship product available at [getgrist.com](https://www.getgrist.com) is built from the code you see here, combined with business-specific software designed to scale to many users, handle billing, etc.

Grist Labs is an open-core company. We offer Grist hosting as a service, with free and paid plans. We also develop and sell features related to Grist using a proprietary license, targeted at the needs of enterprises with large self-managed installations.

We see data portability and autonomy as a key value, and `grist-core` is an essential part of that. We are committed to maintaining and improving the `grist-core` codebase, and to be thoughtful about how proprietary offerings impact data portability and autonomy.

By opening its source code and offering an [OSI](https://opensource.org/)-approved free license, Grist benefits its users:

- **Developer community.** The freedom to examine source code, make bug fixes, and develop
  new features is a big deal for a general-purpose spreadsheet-like product, where there is a
  very long tail of features vital to someone somewhere.
- **Increased trust.** Because anyo

## Development Resources

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application, written in the TypeScript programming language. It builds on the `atproto` TypeScript packages (like [`@atproto/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api)), which are also open source, but in [a different git repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto).

There is a small amount of Go language source code (in `./bskyweb/`), for a web service that returns the React Native Web application.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with the app itself.

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (&quot;AT Protocol&quot; or &quot;atproto&quot;) is a decentralized social media protocol. You don&#039;t *need* to understand AT Protocol to work with this application, but it can help. Learn more at:

- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions) üëà Great place to ask questions
- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)
- [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

The Bluesky Social application encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol framework. The namespace for these &quot;Lexicons&quot; is `app.bsky.*`.

Mastra is the Typescript framework for building AI agents and assistants. It‚Äôs used by some of the largest companies in the world to build internal AI automation tooling and customer-facing agents.

You can run Mastra on your local machine, bundle it into a Node.js server with Hono, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

The main Mastra features are:

| Features                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LLM Models                                             | Mastra uses the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) for model routing, providing a unified interface to interact with any LLM provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. You can choose the specific model and provider, and decide whether to stream the response. |
| [Agents](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview)       | Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions. In Mastra, agents provide LLM models with tools, workflows, and synced data. Agents can call your own functions or APIs of third-party integrations and access knowledge bases you build.                                   |
| [Tools](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/adding-tools)    | Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.                               |
| [Workflows](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview) | Workflows are durable graph-based state machines. They have loops, branching, wait for human input, embed other workflows, do error handling, retries, parsing and so on. They can be built in code or with a visual editor. Each step in a workflow has built-in OpenTelemetry tracing.               |
| [RAG](https://mastra.ai/docs/rag/overview)             | Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) lets you construct a knowledge base for agents. RAG is an ETL pipeline with specific querying techniques, including chunking, embedding, and vector search.                                                                                                       |
| [Integrations](https://mastra.ai/docs/integrations)    | In Mastra, integrations are auto-generated, type-safe API clients for third-party services that can be used as tools for agents or steps in workflows.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Evals](https://mastra.ai/docs/08-running-evals)       | Evals are automated tests that evaluate LLM outputs using model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods. Each eval returns a normalized score between 0-1 that can be logged and compared. Evals can be customized with your own prompts and scoring functions.                                    |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.0+)

## Get an LLM provider API key

If you don&#039;t have an API key for an LLM provider, you can get one from the following services:

If you don&#039;t have an account with these providers, you can sign up and get an API key. Anthropic require a credit card to get an API key. Some OpenAI models and Gemini do not and have a generous free tier for its API.

## Create a new project

The easiest way to get started with Mastra is by using `create-mastra`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Mastra application, with everything set up for you.

```bash
npx create-mastra@latest
```

### Run the script

Finally, run `mastra dev` to open the Mastra playground.

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

If you&#039;re using Anthropic, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If you&#039;re using Gemini, set the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`.

# MCP Server ([@mastra/mcp-docs-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mastra/mcp-docs-server))

Use our MCP server [@mastra/mcp-docs-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mastra/mcp-docs-server) to teach your LLM how to use Mastra.

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with direct access to Mastra.ai&#039;s complete knowledge base.

## In Cursor

Create or update .cursor/mcp.json in your project root:

### MacOS/Linux

```
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;mastra&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@mastra/mcp-docs-server&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows

```
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;mastra&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;cmd&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;/c&quot;, &quot;npx&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@mastra/mcp-docs-server&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

This will make all Mastra documentation tools available in your Cursor workspace. Note that the MCP server wont be enabled by default. You&#039;ll need to go to Cursor settings -&gt; MCP settings and click &quot;enable&quot; on the Mastra MCP server.

## In Windsurf

Create or update ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json:

### MacOS/Linux

```
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;mastra&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@mastra/mcp-docs-server&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

**POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language)** is a novel markup language designed to bring structure, maintainability, and versatility to advanced prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses common challenges in prompt development, such as lack of structure, complex data integration, format sensitivity, and inadequate tooling. POML provides a systematic way to organize prompt components, integrate diverse data types seamlessly, and manage presentation variations, empowering developers to create more sophisticated and reliable LLM applications.

## Demo Video

[![The 5-minute guide to POML](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/b9WDcFsKixo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/b9WDcFsKixo)

## Key Features

- **Structured Prompting Markup**: Employs an HTML-like syntax with semantic components such as `&lt;role&gt;`, `&lt;task&gt;`, and `&lt;example&gt;` to encourage modular design, enhancing prompt readability, reusability, and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Data Handling**: Incorporates specialized data components (e.g., `&lt;document&gt;`, `&lt;table&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;`) that seamlessly embed or reference external data sources like text files, spreadsheets, and images, with customizable formatting options.
- **Decoupled Presentation Styling**: Features a CSS-like styling system that separates content from presentation. This allows developers to modify styling (e.g., verbosity, syntax format) via `&lt;stylesheet&gt;` definitions or inline attributes without altering core prompt logic, mitigating LLM format sensitivity.
- **Integrated Templating Engine**: Includes a built-in templating engine with support for variables (`{{ }}`), loops (`for`), conditionals (`if`), and variable definitions (`&lt;let&gt;`) for dynamically generating complex, data-driven prompts.
- **Rich Development Toolkit**:
  - **IDE Extension (Visual Studio Code)**: Provides essential development aids like syntax highlighting, context-aware auto-completion, hover documentation, real-time previews, inline diagnostics for error checking, and integrated interactive testing.
  - **Software Development Kits (SDKs)**: Offers SDKs for Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) and Python for seamless integration into various application workflows and popular LLM frameworks.

## Quick Start

Here&#039;s a very simple POML example. Please put it in a file named `example.poml`. Make sure it resides in the same directory as the `photosynthesis_diagram.png` image file.

```xml
&lt;poml&gt;
  &lt;role&gt;You are a patient teacher explaining concepts to a 10-year-old.&lt;/role&gt;
  &lt;task&gt;Explain the concept of photosynthesis using the provided image as a reference.&lt;/task&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;photosynthesis_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of photosynthesis&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;output-format&gt;
    Keep the explanation simple, engaging, and under 100 words.
    Start with &quot;Hey there, future scientist!&quot;.
  &lt;/output-format&gt;
&lt;/poml&gt;
```

This example defines a role and task for the LLM, includes an image for context, and specifies the desired output format. With the POML toolkit, the prompt can be easily rendered with a flexible format, and tested with a vision LLM.

## Installation

### Visual Studio Code Extension

Install from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=poml-team.poml).

You can also install the extension manually by downloading the `.vsix` file from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/poml/releases) and installing it in VS Code via the Extensions view.

Before testing prompts with the POML toolkit, make sure you have configured your preferred LLM model, API key, and endpoint. If these are not set, prompt testing will not work.

**To configure in Visual Studio Code:**

- Open the extension settings (open &quot;Settings&quot; and search for &quot;POML&quot;).
- Set your model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Google), API key, and endpoint URL in the POML section.
- Alternatively, you can add these settings directly to your `settings.json` file.

### Node.js (via npm)

```bash
npm install pomljs
```

### Python (via pip)

```bash
pip install poml
```

For development or local installation, you might use `pip install -e .` from a cloned repository.

**Refer to the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/poml) for more details on installing the nightly build.**

## Getting started with React

&gt; Note: Lexical is not only limited to React. Lexical can support any underlying DOM based library once bindings for that library have been created.

Install `lexical` and `@lexical/react`:

```
npm install --save lexical @lexical/react
```

Below is an example of a basic plain text editor using `lexical` and `@lexical/react` ([try it yourself](https://stackblitz.com/github/facebook/lexical/tree/main/examples/react-plain-text?embed=1&amp;file=src%2FApp.tsx&amp;terminalHeight=0&amp;ctl=1&amp;showSidebar=0&amp;devtoolsheight=0&amp;view=preview)).

```jsx
import {$getRoot, $getSelection} from &#039;lexical&#039;;
import {useEffect} from &#039;react&#039;;

import {LexicalComposer} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalComposer&#039;;
import {PlainTextPlugin} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalPlainTextPlugin&#039;;
import {ContentEditable} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalContentEditable&#039;;
import {HistoryPlugin} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalHistoryPlugin&#039;;
import {OnChangePlugin} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalOnChangePlugin&#039;;
import {useLexicalComposerContext} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext&#039;;
import {LexicalErrorBoundary} from &#039;@lexical/react/LexicalErrorBoundary&#039;;

const theme = {
  // Theme styling goes here
  // ...
}

// When the editor changes, you can get notified via the
// LexicalOnChangePlugin!
function onChange(editorState) {
  editorState.read(() =&gt; {
    // Read the contents of the EditorState here.
    const root = $getRoot();
    const selection = $getSelection();

    console.log(root, selection);
  });
}

// Lexical React plugins are React components, which makes them
// highly composable. Furthermore, you can lazy load plugins if
// desired, so you don&#039;t pay the cost for plugins until you
// actually use them.
function MyCustomAutoFocusPlugin() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // Focus the editor when the effect fires!
    editor.focus();
  }, [editor]);

  return null;
}

// Catch any errors that occur during Lexical updates and log them
// or throw them as needed. If you don&#039;t throw them, Lexical will
// try to recover gracefully without losing user data.
function onError(error) {
  console.error(error);
}

function Editor() {
  const initialConfig = {
    namespace: &#039;MyEditor&#039;,
    theme,
    onError,
  };

  return (
    &lt;LexicalComposer initialConfig={initialConfig}&gt;
      &lt;PlainTextPlugin
        contentEditable={
          &lt;ContentEditable
            aria-placeholder={&#039;Enter some text...&#039;}
            placeholder={&lt;div&gt;Enter some text...&lt;/div&gt;}
          /&gt;
        }
        ErrorBoundary={LexicalErrorBoundary}
      /&gt;
      &lt;OnChangePlugin onChange={onChange} /&gt;
      &lt;HistoryPlugin /&gt;
      &lt;MyCustomAutoFocusPlugin /&gt;
    &lt;/LexicalComposer&gt;
  );
}
```

## Lexical is a framework

The core of Lexical is a dependency-free text editor framework that allows developers to build powerful, simple and complex,
editor surfaces. Lexical has a few concepts that are worth exploring:

### Editor instances

Editor instances are the core thing that wires everything together. You can attach a contenteditable DOM element to editor instances, and also
register listeners and commands. Most importantly, the editor allows for updates to its `EditorState`. You can create an editor instance
using the `createEditor()` API, however you normally don&#039;t have to worry when using framework bindings such as `@lexical/react` as this
is handled for you.

### Editor States

An Editor State is the underlying data model that represents what you want to show on the DOM. Editor States contain two parts:

- a Lexical node tree
- a Lexical selection object

Editor States are immutable once created, and in order to create one, you must do so via `editor.update(() =&gt; {...})`. However, you
can also &quot;hook&quot; into an existing update using node transforms or command handlers ‚Äì which are invoked as part of an existing update
workflow to prevent cascading/waterfalling of updates. You can retrieve the current editor state using `editor.getEditorState()`.

Editor States are also fully serializable to JSON and can easily be serialized back into the editor using `editor.parseEditorState()`.

### Reading and Updating Editor State

When you want to read and/or update the Lexical node tree, you must do it via `editor.update(() =&gt; {...})`. You may also do
read-only operations with the editor state via `editor.read(() =&gt; {...})` or `editor.getEditorState().read(() =&gt; {...})`.
The closure passed to the update or read call is important, and must be synchronous. It&#039;s the only place where you have full
&quot;lexical&quot; context of the active editor state, and providing you with access to the Editor State&#039;s node tree. We promote using
the convention of using `$` prefixed functions (such as `$getRoot()`) to convey that these functions must be called in this
context. Attempting to use them outside of a read or update will trigger a runtime error.

For those familiar with React Hooks, you can think of these $functions as having similar functionality:
| *Feature* | React Hooks | Lexical $functions |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Naming Convention | `useFunction` | `$function` |
| Context Required | Can only be called while rendering | Can only be called while in an update or read |
| Can be composed | Hooks can call other hooks | $functions can call other $functions |
| Must be synchronous | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Other rules | ‚ùå Must be called unconditionally in the same order | ‚úÖ None |

Node Transforms and Command Listeners are called with an implicit `editor.update(() =&gt; {...})` context.

It is permitted to do nested updates, or nested reads, but an update should not be nested in a read
or vice versa. For example, `editor.update(() =&gt; editor.update(() =&gt; {...}))` is allowed. It is permitted
to nest an `editor.read` at the end of an `editor.update`, but this will immediately flush the update
and any additional update in that callback will throw an error.

All Lexical Nodes are dependent on the associated Editor State. With few exceptions, you should only call methods
and access properties of a Lexical Node while in a read or update call (just like `$` functions). Methods
on Lexical Nodes will first attempt to locate the latest (and possibly a writable) version of the node from the
active editor state using the node&#039;s unique key. All versions of a logical node have the same key. These keys
are managed by the Editor, are only present at runtime (not serialized), and should be considered to be random and
opaque (do not write tests that assume hard-coded values for keys).

This is done because the editor state&#039;s node tree is recursively frozen after reconciliation to
support efficient time travel (undo/redo and similar use cases). Methods that update nodes
first call `node.getWritable()`, which will create a writable clone of a frozen node. This would normally
mean that any existing references (such as local variables) would refer to a stale version of the node, but
having Lexical Nodes always refer to the editor state allows for a simpler and less error-prone data model.

:::tip

If you use `editor.read(() =&gt; { /* callback */ })` it will first flush any pending updates, so you will
always see a consistent state. When you are in an `editor.update`, you will always be working with the
pending state, where node transforms and DOM reconciliation may not have run yet.
`editor.getEditorState().read()` will use the latest reconciled `EditorState` (after any node transforms,
DOM reconciliation, etc. have already run), any pending `editor.update` mutations will not yet be visible.

:::

### DOM Reconciler

Lexical has its own DOM reconciler that takes a set of Editor States (always the &quot;current&quot; and the &quot;pending&quot;) and applies a &quot;diff&quot;
on them. It then uses this diff to update only the parts of the DOM that need changing. You can think of this as a kind-of virtual DOM,
except Lexical is able to skip doing much of the diffing work, as it knows what was mutated in a given update. The DOM reconciler
adopts performance optimizations that benefit the typical heuristics of a content editable ‚Äì and is able to ensure consistency for
LTR and RTL languages automatically.

### Listeners, Node Transforms and Commands

Outside of invoking updates, the bulk of work done with Lexical is via listeners, node transforms and commands. These all stem from
the editor and are prefixed with `register`. Another important feature is that all the register methods return a function to easily unsubscribe them. For example here is how you listen to an update to a Lexical editor:

```js
const unregisterListener = editor.registerUpdateListener(({editorState}) =&gt; {
  // An update has occurred!
  console.log(editorState);
});

// Ensure we remove the listener later!
unregisterListener();
```

Commands are the communication system used to wire everything together in Lexical. Custom commands can be created using `createCommand()` and
dispatched to an editor using `editor.dispatchCommand(command, payload)`. Lexical dispatches commands internally when key presses are triggered
and when other important signals occur. Commands can also be handled using `editor.registerCommand(handler, priority)`, and incoming commands are
propagated through all handlers by priority until a handler stops the propagation (in a similar way to event propagation in the browser).

## Working with Lexical

This section covers how to use Lexical, independently of any framework or library. For those intending to use Lexical in their React applications,
it&#039;s advisable to [check out the source-code for the hooks that are shipped in `@lexical/react`](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/tree/main/packages/lexical-react/src).

### Creating an editor and using it

When you work with Lexical, you normally work with a single editor instance. An editor instance can be thought of as the one responsible
for wiring up an EditorState with the DOM. The editor is also the place where you can register custom nodes, add listeners, and transforms.

An editor instance can be created from the `lexical` package and accepts an optional configuration object that allows for theming and other options:

```js
import {createEditor} from &#039;lexical&#039;;

const config = {
  namespace: &#039;MyEditor&#039;,
  theme: {
    ...
  },
};

const editor = createEditor(config);
```

Once you have an editor instance, when ready, you can associate the editor instance with a content editable `&lt;div&gt;` element in your document:

```js
const contentEditableElement = document.getElementById(&#039;editor&#039;);

editor.setRootElement(contentEditableElement);
```

If you want to clear the editor instance from the element, you can pass `null`. Alternatively, you can switch to another element if need be,
just pass an alternative element reference to `setRootElement()`.

### Working with Editor States

With Lexical, the source of truth is not the DOM, but rather an underlying state model
that Lexical maintains and associates with an editor instance. You can get the latest
editor state from an editor by calling `editor.getEditorState()`.

Editor states are serializable to JSON, and the editor instance provides a useful method
to deserialize stringified editor states.

```js
const stringifiedEditorState = JSON.stringify(editor.getEditorState().toJSON());

const newEditorState = editor.parseEditorState(stringifiedEditorState);
```

### Updating an editor

There are a few ways to update an editor instance:

- Trigger an update with `editor.update()`
- Setting the editor state via `editor.setEditorState()`
- Applying a change as part of an existing update via `editor.registerNodeTransform()`
- Using a command listener with `editor.registerCommand(EXAMPLE_COMMAND, () =&gt; {...}, priority)`

The most common way to update the editor is to use `editor.update()`. Calling this function
requires a function to be passed in that will provide access to mutate the underlying
editor state. When starting a fresh update, the current editor state is cloned and
used as the starting point. From a technical perspective, this means that Lexical leverages a technique
called double-buffering during updates. There&#039;s an editor state to represent what is current on
the screen, and another work-in-progress editor state that represents future changes.

Reconciling an update is typically an async process that allows Lexical to batch multiple synchronous
updates of the editor state together in a single update to the DOM ‚Äì improving performance. When
Lexical is ready to commit the update to the DOM, the underlying mutations and changes in the update
batch will form a new immutable editor state. Calling `editor.getEditorState()` will then return the
latest editor state based on the changes from the update.

Here&#039;s an example of how you can update an editor instance:

```js
import {$getRoot, $getSelection, $createParagraphNode} from &#039;lexical&#039;;

// Inside the `editor.update` you can use special $ prefixed helper functions.
// These functions cannot be used outside the closure, and will error if you try.
// (If you&#039;re familiar with React, you can imagine these to be a bit like using a hook
// outside of a React function component).
editor.update(() =&gt; {
  // Get the RootNode from the EditorState
  const root = $getRoot();

  // Get the selection from the EditorState
  const selection = $getSelection();

  // Create a new ParagraphNode
  const paragraphNode = $createParagraphNode();

  // Create a new TextNode
  const textNode = $createTextNode(&#039;Hello world&#039;);

  // Append the text node to the paragraph
  paragraphNode.append(textNode);

  // Finally, append the paragraph to the root
  root.append(paragraphNode);
});
```

If you want to know when the editor updates so you can react to the changes, you can add an update
listener to the editor, as shown below:

```js
editor.registerUpdateListener(({editorState}) =&gt; {
  // The latest EditorState can be found as `editorState`.
  // To read the contents of the EditorState, use the following API:

  editorState.read(() =&gt; {
    // Just like editor.update(), .read() expects a closure where you can use
    // the $ prefixed helper functions.
  });
});
```

## Usage 

To get started with Amplication, the hosted version of the product can be used. You can get started immediately at [app.amplication.com](https://app.amplication.com). After the login page, you will be guided through creating your first service. The [website](https://amplication.com) provides an overview of the application, additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://docs.amplication.com).

- [To-do application using Amplication and React](https://docs.amplication.com/tutorials/react-todos)
&lt;/details&gt;

## Development

Alternatively, instead of using the hosted version of the product, Amplication can be run locally for code generation purposes or contributions - if so, please refer to our [contributing](#contributing_anchor) section.

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Pre-requisites
&lt;/summary&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
To be able to start development on Amplication, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

###

- Node.js
- Docker
- Git
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
Running Amplication
&lt;/summary&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&gt; **Note**
&gt; It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `&lt; &gt; Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.

Amplication is using a monorepo architecture - powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://nx.dev&quot;&gt;Nx Workspaces&lt;/a&gt; - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To setup a local development environment the following steps can be followed:

**BEFORE** you run the following steps make sure:
1. You have typescript installed locally on you machine ```npm install -g typescript```
2. You are using a supported node version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
3. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))
4. You have `docker` installed and running on your machine


1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/amplication/amplication.git &amp;&amp; cd amplication &amp;&amp; npm install
```

2. Run the setup script, which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages, and setting up the workspace:
```shell
npm run setup:dev
```

3. Option 1: Running the required infrastructure - view infrastructure component logs


```shell
npm run docker:dev
```
3. Option 2: Running the required infrastructure - run the infrastructure components in background
```shell
npm run docker:dev -- -d
```

4. Apply database migrations
```shell
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

5. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `serve:[application]` scripts of the package.json.

```shell
# running the server component
npm run serve:server

# running the client component
npm run serve:client

# running the data-service-generator component
npm run serve:dsg

# running the git-sync-manager component
npm run serve:git

# running the plugin-api component
npm run serve:plugins
```

&gt; **Note**
&gt; In order to run the Amplication client properly, both the client and server need to be started by the `npm run serve:[application]` command, as well as an additional component for development on a specific component.

The development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application components can be found under packages/`[application]`/README.md file. Happy hacking! üëæ
&lt;/details&gt;
