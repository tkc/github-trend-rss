### Onlook for Desktop (aka Onlook Alpha)

We&#039;re in early preview for Onlook Web. If you&#039;re looking for the downloadable desktop electron app, it&#039;s moved to [Onlook Desktop](https://github.com/onlook-dev/desktop).

Why are we moving to the web? Read about our decision: 
[Migrating from Electron to Web](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/electron-to-web-migration)

## Getting Started

Available soon with a [hosted app](https://onlook.com) or
[run locally](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/running-locally).

### Usage

Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project
through into Onlook or start from scratch within the editor.

Use the AI chat to create or edit a project you&#039;re working on. At any time, you can
always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element in
code.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad9f411-b172-4430-81ef-650f4f314666&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Draw-in new divs and re-arrange them within their parent containers by dragging-and-dropping.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/insert-div.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Preview the code side-by-side with your site design.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/code-connect.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Use Onlook&#039;s editor toolbar to adjust Tailwind styles, directly manipulate objects, and experiment with layouts.

## Documentation

For full documentation, visit [docs.onlook.com](https://docs.onlook.com)

To see how to Contribute, visit
[Contributing to Onlook](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/contributing) in our docs.

## How it works

&lt;img width=&quot;676&quot; alt=&quot;architecture&quot; src=&quot;assets/architecture.png&quot;&gt;

1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container
2. The container runs and serves the code
3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame
4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container
5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code
6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code
7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code

This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that
displays DOM elements declaratively (e.g. jsx/tsx/html). We are focused on making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS for now.

For a full walkthrough, check out our
[Architecture Docs](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/architecture).

# SurfSense
While tools like NotebookLM and Perplexity are impressive and highly effective for conducting research on any topic/query, SurfSense elevates this capability by integrating with your personal knowledge base. It is a highly customizable AI research agent, connected to external sources such as search engines (Tavily, LinkUp), Slack, Linear, Notion, YouTube, GitHub, Discord and more to come.

# Zero

An Open-Source Gmail Alternative for the Future of Email

## What is Zero?

Zero is an open-source AI email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to modernize and improve emails through AI agents to truly modernize emails.

## Why Zero?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**.
0.email is different:

- ✅ **Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, fully transparent.
- 🦾 **AI Driven** - Enhance your emails with Agents &amp; LLMs.
- 🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your emails, your data. Zero does not track, collect, or sell your data in any way. Please note: while we integrate with external services, the data passed through them is not under our control and falls under their respective privacy policies and terms of service.
- ⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own email app with ease.
- 📬 **Unified Inbox** – Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.
- 🎨 **Customizable UI &amp; Features** – Tailor your email experience the way you want it.
- 🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Tech Stack

Zero is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth
&lt;!-- - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library --&gt;

### Environment Variables

Run `pnpm nizzy env` to setup your environment variables. It will copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables for you.
For local development a connection string example is provided in the `.env.example` file located in the same folder as the database.

### Database Setup

Zero uses PostgreSQL for storing data. Here&#039;s how to set it up:

1. **Start the Database**

   Run this command to start a local PostgreSQL instance:

   ```bash
   pnpm docker:db:up
   ```

   This creates a database with:

   - Name: `zerodotemail`
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `postgres`
   - Port: `5432`

2. **Set Up Database Connection**

   Make sure your database connection string is in `.env` file. And you have ran `pnpm nizzy sync` to sync the latest env.

   For local development use:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&quot;postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/zerodotemail&quot;
   ```

3. **Database Commands**

   - **Set up database tables**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:push
     ```

   - **Create migration files** (after schema changes):

     ```bash
     pnpm db:generate
     ```

   - **Apply migrations**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:migrate
     ```

   - **View database content**:
     ```bash
     pnpm db:studio
     ```
     &gt; If you run `pnpm dev` in your terminal, the studio command should be automatically running with the app.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Install and initialize project
npx promptfoo@latest init

# Run your first evaluation
npx promptfoo eval
```

See [Getting Started](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/getting-started/) (evals) or [Red Teaming](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/) (vulnerability scanning) for more.

## What can you do with Promptfoo?

- **Test your prompts and models** with [automated evaluations](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- **Secure your LLM apps** with [red teaming](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/) and vulnerability scanning
- **Compare models** side-by-side (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, Ollama, and [more](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/providers/))
- **Automate checks** in [CI/CD](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/integrations/ci-cd/)
- **Share results** with your team

Here&#039;s what it looks like in action:

## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker&lt;nobr&gt; microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

Using Appwrite, you can easily integrate your app with user authentication and multiple sign-in methods, a database for storing and querying users and team data, storage and file management, image manipulation, Cloud Functions, messaging, and [more services](https://appwrite.io/docs).

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with Appwrite is by [signing up for Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/). While Appwrite Cloud is in public beta, you can build with Appwrite completely free, and we won&#039;t collect you credit card information. 

## Self-Hosting

Appwrite is designed to run in a containerized environment. Running your server is as easy as running one command from your terminal. You can either run Appwrite on your localhost using docker-compose or on any other container orchestration tool, such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/).

Before running the installation command, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine:

### Unix

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --volume &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \
    --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; \
    appwrite/appwrite:1.7.3
```

### Windows

#### CMD

```cmd
docker run -it --rm ^
    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    --volume &quot;%cd%&quot;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^
    --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; ^
    appwrite/appwrite:1.7.3
```

#### PowerShell

```powershell
docker run -it --rm `
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
    --volume ${pwd}/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw `
    --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; `
    appwrite/appwrite:1.7.3
```

Once the Docker installation is complete, go to http://localhost to access the Appwrite console from your browser. Please note that on non-Linux native hosts, the server might take a few minutes to start after completing the installation.

For advanced production and custom installation, check out our Docker [environment variables](https://appwrite.io/docs/environment-variables) docs. You can also use our public [docker-compose.yml](https://appwrite.io/install/compose) and [.env](https://appwrite.io/install/env) files to manually set up an environment.

### Upgrade from an Older Version

If you are upgrading your Appwrite server from an older version, you should use the Appwrite migration tool once your setup is completed. For more information regarding this, check out the [Installation Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting).

## One-Click Setups

In addition to running Appwrite locally, you can also launch Appwrite using a pre-configured setup. This allows you to get up and running quickly with Appwrite without installing Docker on your local machine.

Choose from one of the providers below:

## Architecture

![Appwrite Architecture showing how Appwrite is built and the services and tools it uses](docs/specs/overview.drawio.svg)

Appwrite uses a microservices architecture that was designed for easy scaling and delegation of responsibilities. In addition, Appwrite supports multiple APIs, such as REST, WebSocket, and GraphQL to allow you to interact with your resources by leveraging your existing knowledge and protocols of choice.

The Appwrite API layer was designed to be extremely fast by leveraging in-memory caching and delegating any heavy-lifting tasks to the Appwrite background workers. The background workers also allow you to precisely control your compute capacity and costs using a message queue to handle the load. You can learn more about our architecture in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture-1).

## Contributing

All code contributions, including those of people having commit access, must go through a pull request and be approved by a core developer before being merged. This is to ensure a proper review of all the code.

We truly :heart: pull requests! If you wish to help, you can learn more about how you can contribute to this project in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

&gt; An ecosystem of tools to build robust applications in TypeScript

## Introduction

Welcome to Effect, a powerful TypeScript framework that provides a fully-fledged functional effect system with a rich standard library.

Effect consists of several packages that work together to help build robust TypeScript applications. The core package, `effect`, serves as the foundation of the framework, offering primitives for managing side effects, ensuring type safety, and supporting concurrency.

The Effect monorepo is organized into multiple packages, each extending the core functionality. Below is an overview of the packages included:

| Package                           | Description                                                                                 |                                                                                                    |

# Contributing via Pull Requests

We welcome contributions via pull requests! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Setting Up Your Environment

Begin by forking the repository and clone it to your local machine.

Navigate into the cloned repository and create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

Ensure all required dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
pnpm install  # Requires pnpm version 10.4.0
```

## Making Changes

### Implement Your Changes

Make the changes you propose to the codebase. If your changes impact functionality, please **add corresponding tests** to validate your updates.

### Validate Your Changes

Run the following commands to ensure your changes do not introduce any issues:

- `pnpm codegen` (optional): Re-generate the package entrypoints in case you have changed the structure of a package or introduced a new module.
- `pnpm check`: Confirm that the code compiles without errors.
- `pnpm test`: Execute all unit tests to ensure your changes haven&#039;t broken existing functionality.
- `pnpm circular`: Check for any circular dependencies in imports.
- `pnpm lint`: Ensure the code adheres to our coding standards.
  - If you encounter style issues, use `pnpm lint-fix` to automatically correct some of these.
- `pnpm test-types`: Run type-level tests. Tests are written using [tstyche](https://tstyche.org/).
- `pnpm docgen`: Ensure the documentation generates correctly and reflects any changes made.

### Document Your Changes

#### JSDoc Comments

When adding a new feature, it&#039;s important to document your code using JSDoc comments. This helps other developers understand the purpose and usage of your changes. Include at least the following in your JSDoc comments:

- **A Short Description**: Summarize the purpose and functionality of the feature.
- **Example**: Provide a usage example under the `@example` tag to demonstrate how to use the feature.
- **Since Version**: Use the `@since` tag to indicate the version in which the feature was introduced. If you&#039;re unsure about the version, please consult with a project maintainer.
- **Category (Optional)**: You can categorize the feature with the `@category` tag to help organize the documentation. If you&#039;re unsure about what category to assign, ask a project maintainer.

**Note**: A HTML utility file, [`code2jsdoc-example.html`](/scripts/jsdocs/code2jsdoc-example.html), has been added to assist with creating JSDoc `@example` comments. This web-based interface includes two text areas:

1. An input textarea for pasting example code.
2. An output textarea that dynamically generates formatted JSDoc `@example` comments.

This utility helps ensure consistent formatting and streamlines the process of documenting examples. See the following example of its usage:

Example Input:

```ts
import { Effect } from &quot;effect&quot;

console.log(Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.succeed(1)))
/*
Output:
{
  _id: &quot;Exit&quot;,
  _tag: &quot;Success&quot;,
  value: 1
}
*/
```

Output:

````
*
* @example
* ```ts
* import { Effect } from &quot;effect&quot;
*
* console.log(Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.succeed(1)))
* // Output:
* // {
* //   _id: &quot;Exit&quot;,
* //   _tag: &quot;Success&quot;,
* //   value: 1
* // }
* ```
*
````

By using this utility, you can save time and maintain consistency in your JSDoc comments, especially for complex examples.

#### Changeset Documentation

Before committing your changes, document them with a changeset. This process helps in tracking modifications and effectively communicating them to the project team and users:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

During the changeset creation process, you will be prompted to select the appropriate level for your changes:

- **patch**: Opt for this if you are making small fixes or minor changes that do not affect the library&#039;s overall functionality.
- **minor**: Choose this for new features that enhance functionality but do not disrupt existing features.
- **major**: Select this for any changes that result in backward-incompatible modifications to the library.

## Finalizing Your Contribution

### Commit Your Changes

Once you have documented your changes with a changeset, it’s time to commit them to the repository. Use a clear and descriptive commit message, which could be the same message you used in your changeset:

```bash
git commit -am &#039;Add some feature&#039;
```

#### Linking to Issues

If your commit addresses an open issue, reference the issue number directly in your commit message. This helps to link your contribution clearly to specific tasks or bug reports. Additionally, if your commit resolves the issue, you can indicate this by adding a phrase like `&quot;, closes #&lt;issue-number&gt;&quot;`. For example:

```bash
git commit -am &#039;Add some feature, closes #123&#039;
```

This practice not only helps in tracking the progress of issues but also automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged, streamlining project management.

### Push to Your Fork

Push the changes up to your GitHub fork:

```bash
git push origin my-branch
```

### Create a Pull Request

Open a pull request against the appropriate branch on the original repository:

- `main` branch: For minor patches or bug fixes.
- `next-minor` branch: For new features that are non-breaking.
- `next-major` branch: For changes that introduce breaking modifications.

Please be patient! We will do our best to review your pull request as soon as possible.

## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is an open source platform and SDK which allows you to create long-running background jobs. Write normal async code, deploy, and never hit a timeout.

### Key features:

- JavaScript and TypeScript SDK
- No timeouts
- Retries (with exponential backoff)
- Queues and concurrency controls
- Schedules and crons
- Full Observability; logs, live trace views, advanced filtering
- React hooks to interact with the Trigger API from your React app
- Pipe LLM streams straight to your users through the Realtime API
- Trigger tasks and display the run status and metadata anywhere in your app
- Custom alerts, get notified by email, Slack or webhooks
- No infrastructure to manage
- Elastic (scaling)
- Works with your existing tech stack

## In your codebase

Create tasks where they belong: in your codebase. Version control, localhost, test and review like you&#039;re already used to.

```ts
import { task } from &quot;@trigger.dev/sdk/v3&quot;;

//1. You need to export each task
export const helloWorld = task({
  //2. Use a unique id for each task
  id: &quot;hello-world&quot;,
  //3. The run function is the main function of the task
  run: async (payload: { message: string }) =&gt; {
    //4. You can write code that runs for a long time here, there are no timeouts
    console.log(payload.message);
  },
});
```

## Deployment

Use our SDK to write tasks in your codebase. There&#039;s no infrastructure to manage, your tasks automatically scale and connect to our cloud. Or you can always self-host.

## Environments

We support `Development`, `Staging`, and `Production` environments, allowing you to test your tasks before deploying them to production.

## Full visibility of every job run

View every task in every run so you can tell exactly what happened. We provide a full trace view of every task run so you can see what happened at every step.

Mastra is an opinionated TypeScript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

The main Mastra features are:

| Features                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LLM Models                                             | Mastra uses the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) for model routing, providing a unified interface to interact with any LLM provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. You can choose the specific model and provider, and decide whether to stream the response. |
| [Agents](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview)       | Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions. In Mastra, agents provide LLM models with tools, workflows, and synced data. Agents can call your own functions or APIs of third-party integrations and access knowledge bases you build.                                   |
| [Tools](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/adding-tools)    | Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.                               |
| [Workflows](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview) | Workflows are durable graph-based state machines. They have loops, branching, wait for human input, embed other workflows, do error handling, retries, parsing and so on. They can be built in code or with a visual editor. Each step in a workflow has built-in OpenTelemetry tracing.               |
| [RAG](https://mastra.ai/docs/rag/overview)             | Retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) lets you construct a knowledge base for agents. RAG is an ETL pipeline with specific querying techniques, including chunking, embedding, and vector search.                                                                                                      |
| [Integrations](https://mastra.ai/docs/integrations)    | In Mastra, integrations are auto-generated, type-safe API clients for third-party services that can be used as tools for agents or steps in workflows.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Evals](https://mastra.ai/docs/08-running-evals)       | Evals are automated tests that evaluate LLM outputs using model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods. Each eval returns a normalized score between 0-1 that can be logged and compared. Evals can be customized with your own prompts and scoring functions.                                    |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.0+)

## Get an LLM provider API key

If you don&#039;t have an API key for an LLM provider, you can get one from the following services:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)
- [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview)
- [Cerebras](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/introduction)

If you don&#039;t have an account with these providers, you can sign up and get an API key. Anthropic require a credit card to get an API key. Some OpenAI models and Gemini do not and have a generous free tier for its API.

## Create a new project

The easiest way to get started with Mastra is by using `create-mastra`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Mastra application, with everything set up for you.

```bash
npx create-mastra@latest
```

### Run the script

Finally, run `mastra dev` to open the Mastra playground.

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

If you&#039;re using Anthropic, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If you&#039;re using Gemini, set the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`.

## Contributing

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

## Contribution

Better Auth is free and open source project licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md). You are free to do whatever you want with it.

You could help continuing its development by:

- [Contribute to the source code](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Suggest new features and report issues](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues)

## Security

&lt;/div&gt;

[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/) is a suite of advanced React UI components for a wide range of complex use cases.
Each component provides best-in-class UX and DX, with sophisticated UX workflows for data-rich applications.
Components include the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree View.

MUI X extends the core functionality of [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/), but the advanced components also stand on their own and can be fully customized to meet the needs of any design system.

MUI X is **open-core**: [Community](#community-plan) components are MIT-licensed and free forever, while more advanced features and components require a [Pro](#pro-plan) or [Premium](#premium-plan) commercial license.
See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.

## Licensing

The MUI X team has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, starting with Material UI, and we&#039;re committed to the continued advancement of our open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
Learn more about [our stewardship ethos](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced components and features that can&#039;t reasonably be maintained by the open-source community alone.
These licenses make it possible for us to support a full-time staff of engineers.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it&#039;s only because we believe you won&#039;t find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

### Plans

#### Community plan

The free Community version of MUI X contains components and features that we believe are maintainable by contributions from the open-source community.

    &lt;h1&gt;Zigbee2MQTT  🌉 🐝&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Allows you to use your Zigbee devices &lt;b&gt;without&lt;/b&gt; the vendor&#039;s bridge or gateway.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via MQTT. In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## [Getting started](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/getting-started)

The [documentation](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) provides you all the information needed to get up and running! Make sure you don&#039;t skip sections if this is your first visit, as there might be important details in there for you.

If you aren&#039;t familiar with **Zigbee** terminology make sure you [read this](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/zigbee/01_zigbee_network.html) to help you out.

## [Integrations](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/integrations.html)

Zigbee2MQTT integrates well with (almost) every home automation solution because it uses MQTT. However the following integrations are worth mentioning:

## Architecture

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)

### Internal Architecture

Zigbee2MQTT is made up of three modules, each developed in its own Github project. Starting from the hardware (adapter) and moving up; [zigbee-herdsman](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman) connects to your Zigbee adapter and makes an API available to the higher levels of the stack. For e.g. Texas Instruments hardware, zigbee-herdsman uses the [TI zStack monitoring and test API](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/raw/master/docs/Z-Stack%20Monitor%20and%20Test%20API.pdf) to communicate with the adapter. Zigbee-herdsman handles the core Zigbee communication. The module [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters) handles the mapping from individual device models to the Zigbee clusters they support. [Zigbee clusters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/blob/master/docs/07-5123-08-Zigbee-Cluster-Library.pdf) are the layers of the Zigbee protocol on top of the base protocol that define things like how lights, sensors and switches talk to each other over the Zigbee network. Finally, the Zigbee2MQTT module drives zigbee-herdsman and maps the zigbee messages to MQTT messages. Zigbee2MQTT also keeps track of the state of the system. It uses a `database.db` file to store this state; a text file with a JSON database of connected devices and their capabilities. Zigbee2MQTT provides a [web-based interface](https://github.com/nurikk/zigbee2mqtt-frontend) that allows monitoring and configuration.

### Developing

Zigbee2MQTT uses TypeScript (partially for now). Therefore after making changes to files in the `lib/` directory you need to recompile Zigbee2MQTT. This can be done by executing `pnpm run build`. For faster development instead of running `pnpm run build` you can run `pnpm run build-watch` in another terminal session, this will recompile as you change files.

Before running any of the commands, you&#039;ll first need to run `pnpm install --include=dev`.
Before submitting changes run `pnpm run check:w` then `pnpm run test:coverage`.

## Supported devices

See [Supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices) to check whether your device is supported. There is quite an extensive list, including devices from vendors like [Xiaomi](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Xiaomi), [Ikea](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=IKEA), [Philips](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Philips), [OSRAM](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=OSRAM) and more.

If it&#039;s not listed in [Supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices), support can be added (fairly) easily, see [How to support new devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/support-new-devices/01_support_new_devices.html).

## Support &amp; help

If you need assistance you can check [opened issues](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues). Feel free to help with Pull Requests when you were able to fix things or add new devices or just share the love on social media.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

# Bolt.new: AI-Powered Full-Stack Web Development in the Browser

Bolt.new is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser—no local setup required. If you&#039;re here to build your own AI-powered web dev agent using the Bolt open source codebase, [click here to get started!](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## What Makes Bolt.new Different

Claude, v0, etc are incredible- but you can&#039;t install packages, run backends or edit code. That’s where Bolt.new stands out:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Bolt.new integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by **StackBlitz’s WebContainers**. This allows you to:
  - Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Interact with third-party APIs
  - Deploy to production from chat
  - Share your work via a URL

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Bolt.new gives AI models **complete control** over the entire  environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.

Whether you’re an experienced developer, a PM or designer, Bolt.new allows you to build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

For developers interested in building their own AI-powered development tools with WebContainers, check out the open-source Bolt codebase in this repo!

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips to get the most out of Bolt.new:

- **Be specific about your stack**: If you want to use specific frameworks or libraries (like Astro, Tailwind, ShadCN, or any other popular JavaScript framework), mention them in your initial prompt to ensure Bolt scaffolds the project accordingly.

- **Use the enhance prompt icon**: Before sending your prompt, try clicking the &#039;enhance&#039; icon to have the AI model help you refine your prompt, then edit the results before submitting.

- **Scaffold the basics first, then add features**: Make sure the basic structure of your application is in place before diving into more advanced functionality. This helps Bolt understand the foundation of your project and ensure everything is wired up right before building out more advanced functionality.

- **Batch simple instructions**: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Bolt to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and restart the dev server, all in one go saving you time and reducing API credit consumption significantly.
