## 🎯 What is Shannon?

Shannon is an AI pentester that delivers actual exploits, not just alerts.

Shannon&#039;s goal is to break your web app before someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.

**What Problem Does Shannon Solve?**

Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a *massive* security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.

Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester. It doesn&#039;t just find potential issues. It executes real exploits, providing concrete proof of vulnerabilities. This lets you ship with confidence, knowing every build can be secured.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **From Autonomous Pentesting to Automated Compliance**
&gt;
&gt; Shannon is a core component of the **Keygraph Security and Compliance Platform**.
&gt;
&gt; While Shannon automates the critical task of penetration testing for your application, our broader platform automates your entire compliance journey—from evidence collection to audit readiness. We&#039;re building the &quot;Rippling for Cybersecurity,&quot; a single platform to manage your security posture and streamline compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and HIPAA.

## 🚀 Setup &amp; Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **AI Provider Credentials** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API key** (recommended) - Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
  - **Claude Code OAuth token**
  - **[EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Alternative providers via Router Mode** - OpenAI or Google Gemini via OpenRouter (see [Router Mode](#experimental---unsupported-router-mode-alternative-providers))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone Shannon
git clone https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon.git
cd shannon

# 2. Configure credentials (choose one method)

# Option A: Export environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;              # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000           # recommended

# Option B: Create a .env file
cat &gt; .env &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
EOF

# 3. Run a pentest
./shannon start URL=https://your-app.com REPO=/path/to/your/repo
```

Shannon will build the containers, start the workflow, and return a workflow ID. The pentest runs in the background.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# View real-time worker logs
./shannon logs

# Query a specific workflow&#039;s progress
./shannon query ID=shannon-1234567890

# Open the Temporal Web UI for detailed monitoring
open http://localhost:8233
```

### Stopping Shannon

```bash
# Stop all containers (preserves workflow data)
./shannon stop

# Full cleanup (removes all data)
./shannon stop CLEAN=true
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic pentest
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo

# With a configuration file
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo CONFIG=./configs/my-config.yaml

# Custom output directory
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo OUTPUT=./my-reports
```

### Prepare Your Repository

Shannon is designed for **web application security testing** and expects all application code to be available in a single directory structure. This works well for:

- **Monorepos** - Single repository containing all components
- **Consolidated setups** - Multiple repositories organized in a shared folder

**For monorepos:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-monorepo.git /path/to/your-app
```

**For multi-repository applications** (e.g., separate frontend/backend):

```bash
mkdir /path/to/your-app
cd /path/to/your-app
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/api.git
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Linux (Native Docker):**

You may need to run commands with `sudo` depending on your Docker setup. If you encounter permission issues with output files, ensure your user has access to the Docker socket.

**For macOS:**

Works out of the box with Docker Desktop installed.

**Testing Local Applications:**

Docker containers cannot reach `localhost` on your host machine. Use `host.docker.internal` in place of `localhost`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 REPO=/path/to/repo
```

### Configuration (Optional)

While you can run without a config file, creating one enables authenticated testing and customized analysis.

#### Create Configuration File

Copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
cp configs/example-config.yaml configs/my-app-config.yaml
```

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
authentication:
  login_type: form
  login_url: &quot;https://your-app.com/login&quot;
  credentials:
    username: &quot;test@example.com&quot;
    password: &quot;yourpassword&quot;
    totp_secret: &quot;LB2E2RX7XFHSTGCK&quot;  # Optional for 2FA

  login_flow:
    - &quot;Type $username into the email field&quot;
    - &quot;Type $password into the password field&quot;
    - &quot;Click the &#039;Sign In&#039; button&quot;

  success_condition:
    type: url_contains
    value: &quot;/dashboard&quot;

rules:
  avoid:
    - description: &quot;AI should avoid testing logout functionality&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/logout&quot;

  focus:
    - description: &quot;AI should emphasize testing API endpoints&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/api&quot;
```

#### TOTP Setup for 2FA

If your application uses two-factor authentication, simply add the TOTP secret to your config file. The AI will automatically generate the required codes during testing.

### [EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Router Mode (Alternative Providers)

Shannon can experimentally route requests through alternative AI providers using claude-code-router. This mode is not officially supported and is intended primarily for:

* **Model experimentation** — try Shannon with GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3–family models

#### Quick Setup

1. Add your provider API key to `.env`:

```bash
# Choose one provider:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Set default model:
ROUTER_DEFAULT=openai,gpt-5.2  # provider,model format
```

2. Run with `ROUTER=true`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo ROUTER=true
```

#### Experimental Models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-5.2, gpt-5-mini |
| OpenRouter | google/gemini-3-flash-preview |

#### Disclaimer

This feature is experimental and unsupported. Output quality depends heavily on the model. Shannon is built on top of the Anthropic Agent SDK and is optimized and primarily tested with Anthropic Claude models. Alternative providers may produce inconsistent results (including failing early phases like Recon) depending on the model and routing setup.

### Output and Results

All results are saved to `./audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/` by default. Use `--output &lt;path&gt;` to specify a custom directory.

Output structure:
```
audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/
├── session.json          # Metrics and session data
├── agents/               # Per-agent execution logs
├── prompts/              # Prompt snapshots for reproducibility
└── deliverables/
    └── comprehensive_security_assessment_report.md   # Final comprehensive security report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shannon emulates a human penetration tester&#039;s methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. It combines white-box source code analysis with black-box dynamic exploitation across four distinct phases:

```

### Architectural Overview

Shannon is engineered to emulate the methodology of a human penetration tester. It leverages Anthropic&#039;s Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of **white-box source code analysis** with the real-world validation of **black-box dynamic exploitation**, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.

---

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application&#039;s attack surface. Shannon analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.

#### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of **hypothesized exploitable paths** that are passed on for validation.

#### **Phase 3: Exploitation**

Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict **&quot;No Exploit, No Report&quot;** policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.

#### **Phase 4: Reporting**

The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with **reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts**, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.


## 📋 Coverage and Roadmap

For detailed information about Shannon&#039;s security testing coverage and development roadmap, see our [Coverage and Roadmap](./COVERAGE.md) documentation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

### Important Usage Guidelines &amp; Disclaimers

Please review the following guidelines carefully before using Shannon (Lite). As a user, you are responsible for your actions and assume all liability.

#### **1. Potential for Mutative Effects &amp; Environment Selection**

This is not a passive scanner. The exploitation agents are designed to **actively execute attacks** to confirm vulnerabilities. This process can have mutative effects on the target application and its data.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; **⚠️ DO NOT run Shannon on production environments.**

## What is LikeC4? Why &quot;like&quot;?

LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture and tools to generate diagrams from the model.

LikeC4 is inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), but provides some flexibility.
You customize or define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in architecture model.\
Perfectly tailored to your needs.

## What does LikeC4 look like?

            <h2>README</h2><pre># GitHub Copilot - Your AI peer programmer

**[GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)** is an AI peer programming tool that helps you write code faster and smarter.

GitHub Copilot adapts to your unique needs allowing you to select the best model for your project, customize chat responses with custom instructions, and utilize agent mode for AI-powered, seamlessly integrated peer programming sessions.

**Sign up for [GitHub Copilot Free](https://github.com/settings/copilot?utm_source=vscode-chat-readme&amp;utm_medium=first&amp;utm_campaign=2025mar-em-MSFT-signup)!**

![Working with GitHub Copilot agent mode to make edits to code in your workspace](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/blob/main/images/hero-dark.png?raw=true)

When you install Copilot in Visual Studio Code, you get two extensions:
* **[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)** - Provides inline coding suggestions as you type.
* **[GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)** (this extension) - A companion extension that provides conversational AI assistance.

## Getting access to GitHub Copilot

Sign up for [GitHub Copilot Free](https://github.com/settings/copilot?utm_source=vscode-chat-readme&amp;utm_medium=second&amp;utm_campaign=2025mar-em-MSFT-signup), or request access from your enterprise admin.

To access GitHub Copilot, an active GitHub Copilot subscription is required. You can read more about our business and individual offerings at [github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=vscode-chat&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=2025mar-em-MSFT-signup).

## AI-powered coding sessions

**Start an AI-powered coding session tailored to your workflow**. Copilot Edits allows you to quickly iterate on code changes directly in the editor, across multiple files using natural language. For a more autonomous peer programmer experience,
[agent mode](https://aka.ms/vscode-copilot-agent) performs multi-step coding tasks at your command. It automatically handles compile and lint errors, monitors terminal and test output, and iterates until the task is complete. [Edit mode](https://aka.ms/vscode-copilot-edit) offers a conversational, step-by-step coding experience. Engage in multi-turn chat conversations while Copilot applies edits directly to your codebase, allowing you to review changes in context and maintain full control.

![Agent mode in Copilot Chat creating a new Vue application](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/blob/main/images/agent-mode-readme.gif?raw=true)

## Inline suggestions in the editor

**Automatically receive inline suggestions in the editor** from [ghost text suggestions](https://aka.ms/vscode-completions) and [next edit suggestions](https://aka.ms/vscode-nes) to help you write code faster. Ghost text suggestions provide suggestions at the current location, tailored to your coding style and your existing code. Copilot next edit suggestions (Copilot NES) takes it a step further and predicts what and where your next logical code change will be. Use the Tab key to navigate and accept changes in quick succession.

![Copilot next edit suggestions](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-point.gif)

## Ask and learn about your code with chat

**Ask Copilot for help with any task or question** in the [Chat view](https://aka.ms/vscode-chat), bringing in code from your current files. Rather than giving you a generic answer, it can give answers that are relevant for your codebase using information provided by [participants](https://aka.ms/vscode-chat-participants), [variables](https://aka.ms/vscode-chat-variables), and [slash commands](https://aka.ms/vscode-chat-commands).

![Using the workspace chat participant](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/blob/main/images/participants-workspace.gif?raw=true)

**Apply Copilot&#039;s AI suggestions directly to your code** using [Inline chat](https://aka.ms/vscode-inline-chat), staying in the flow. Need help with refactoring a method, adding error handling, or explaining a complex algorithm - just launch Copilot in the editor!

![Inline chat in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-chat/inline-chat-question-example.png)

### Supported languages and frameworks

GitHub Copilot works on any language, including Java, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, C#, or C++. Because it’s been trained on languages in public repositories, it works for most popular languages, libraries and frameworks.

### Version compatibility

As Copilot Chat releases in lockstep with VS Code due to its deep UI integration, every new version of Copilot Chat is only compatible with the latest and newest release of VS Code. This means that if you are using an older version of VS Code, you will not be able to use the latest Copilot Chat.

Only the latest Copilot Chat versions will use the latest models provided by the Copilot service, as even minor model upgrades require prompt changes and fixes in the extension.

### Privacy and preview terms

By using Copilot Chat you agree to [GitHub Copilot chat preview terms](https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/copilot/github-copilot-chat-technical-preview-license-terms). Review the [transparency note](https://aka.ms/CopilotChatTransparencyNote) to understand about usage, limitations and ways to improve Copilot Chat during the technical preview.

Your code is yours. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) to ensure that your code snippets will not be used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.

To get the latest security fixes, please use the latest version of the Copilot extension and VS Code.

## 快速开始

### 1. 使用在线版本（推荐）

直接访问：[https://prompt.always200.com](https://prompt.always200.com)

项目是纯前端项目，所有数据只存储在浏览器本地，不会上传至任何服务器，因此直接使用在线版本也是安全可靠的

### 2. Vercel部署
方式1：一键部署到自己的Vercel(方便，但后续无法自动更新)：
   [![部署到 Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flinshenkx%2Fprompt-optimizer)

方式2: Fork项目后在Vercel中导入（推荐，但需参考部署文档进行手动设置）：
   - 先Fork项目到自己的GitHub
   - 然后在Vercel中导入该项目
   - 可跟踪源项目更新，便于同步最新功能和修复
- 配置环境变量：
  - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`：设置访问密码，启用访问限制
  - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`等：配置各AI服务商的API密钥

更多详细的部署步骤和注意事项，请查看：
- [Vercel部署指南](docs/user/deployment/vercel.md)

### 3. 下载桌面应用
从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer/releases) 下载最新版本。我们为各平台提供**安装程序**和**压缩包**两种格式。

- **安装程序 (推荐)**: 如 `*.exe`, `*.dmg`, `*.AppImage` 等。**强烈推荐使用此方式，因为它支持自动更新**。
- **压缩包**: 如 `*.zip`。解压即用，但无法自动更新。

**桌面应用核心优势**:
- ✅ **无跨域限制**：作为原生桌面应用，它能彻底摆脱浏览器跨域（CORS）问题的困扰。这意味着您可以直接连接任何AI服务提供商的API，包括本地部署的Ollama或有严格安全策略的商业API，获得最完整、最稳定的功能体验。
- ✅ **自动更新**：通过安装程序（如 `.exe`, `.dmg`）安装的版本，能够自动检查并更新到最新版。
- ✅ **独立运行**：无需依赖浏览器，提供更快的响应和更佳的性能。

```
&lt;/details&gt;

你还可以直接编辑docker-compose.yml文件，自定义配置：
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看 docker-compose.yml 示例&lt;/summary&gt;

```yaml
services:
  prompt-optimizer:
    # 使用Docker Hub镜像
    image: linshen/prompt-optimizer:latest
    # 或使用阿里云镜像（国内用户推荐）
    # image: registry.cn-guangzhou.aliyuncs.com/prompt-optimizer/prompt-optimizer:latest
    container_name: prompt-optimizer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &quot;8081:80&quot;  # Web应用端口（包含MCP服务器，通过/mcp路径访问）
    environment:
      # API密钥配置
      - VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
      - VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
      # 访问控制（可选）
      - ACCESS_USERNAME=admin
      - ACCESS_PASSWORD=your_password
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### 7. MCP Server 使用说明
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看 MCP Server 使用说明&lt;/summary&gt;

Prompt Optimizer 现在支持 Model Context Protocol (MCP) 协议，可以与 Claude Desktop 等支持 MCP 的 AI 应用集成。

当通过 Docker 运行时，MCP Server 会自动启动，并可通过 `http://ip:port/mcp` 访问。

#### 环境变量配置

MCP Server 需要配置 API 密钥才能正常工作。主要的 MCP 专属配置：

```bash
# MCP 服务器配置
MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai  # 可选值：openai, gemini, deepseek, siliconflow, zhipu, custom
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info                 # 日志级别
```

#### Docker 环境下使用 MCP

在 Docker 环境中，MCP Server 会与 Web 应用一起运行，您可以通过 Web 应用的相同端口访问 MCP 服务，路径为 `/mcp`。

例如，如果您将容器的 80 端口映射到主机的 8081 端口：
```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:80 \
  -e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key \
  -e MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai \
  --name prompt-optimizer \
  linshen/prompt-optimizer
```

那么 MCP Server 将可以通过 `http://localhost:8081/mcp` 访问。

#### Claude Desktop 集成示例

要在 Claude Desktop 中使用 Prompt Optimizer，您需要在 Claude Desktop 的配置文件中添加服务配置。

1. 找到 Claude Desktop 的配置目录：
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\services`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/services`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/services`

2. 编辑或创建 `services.json` 文件，添加以下内容：

```json
{
  &quot;services&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Prompt Optimizer&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8081/mcp&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

请确保将 `localhost:8081` 替换为您实际部署 Prompt Optimizer 的地址和端口。

#### 可用工具

- **optimize-user-prompt**: 优化用户提示词以提高 LLM 性能
- **optimize-system-prompt**: 优化系统提示词以提高 LLM 性能
- **iterate-prompt**: 对已经成熟/完善的提示词进行定向迭代优化

更多详细信息，请查看 [MCP 服务器用户指南](docs/user/mcp-server.md)。
&lt;/details&gt;

## ⚙️ API密钥配置

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看API密钥配置方法&lt;/summary&gt;

### 方式一：通过界面配置（推荐）
1. 点击界面右上角的&quot;⚙️设置&quot;按钮

## 常见问题

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看常见问题解答&lt;/summary&gt;

### API连接问题

#### Q1: 为什么配置好API密钥后仍然无法连接到模型服务？
**A**: 大多数连接失败是由**跨域问题**（CORS）导致的。由于本项目是纯前端应用，浏览器出于安全考虑会阻止直接访问不同源的API服务。模型服务如未正确配置CORS策略，会拒绝来自浏览器的直接请求。

#### Q2: 如何解决本地Ollama的连接问题？
**A**: Ollama完全支持OpenAI标准接口，只需配置正确的跨域策略：
1. 设置环境变量 `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` 允许任意来源的请求
2. 如仍有问题，设置 `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` 监听任意IP地址

#### Q3: 如何解决商业API（如Nvidia的DS API、字节跳动的火山API）的跨域问题？
**A**: 这些平台通常有严格的跨域限制，推荐以下解决方案：

1. **使用桌面版应用**（最推荐）
   - 桌面应用作为原生应用，完全没有跨域限制
   - 可以直接连接任何API服务，包括本地部署的模型
   - 提供最完整、最稳定的功能体验
   - 从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer/releases) 下载

2. **使用自部署的API中转服务**（专业方案）
   - 部署如OneAPI、NewAPI等开源API聚合/代理工具
   - 在设置中配置为自定义API端点
   - 请求流向：浏览器→中转服务→模型服务提供商
   - 完全控制安全策略和访问权限

**注意**：Web版（包括在线版、Vercel部署、Docker部署）都是纯前端应用，都会受到浏览器CORS限制。只有桌面版或使用API中转服务才能解决跨域问题。

#### Q4: 我已正确配置本地模型（如Ollama）的跨域策略，为什么使用在线版依然无法连接？
**A**: 这是由浏览器的**混合内容（Mixed Content）安全策略**导致的。出于安全考虑，浏览器会阻止安全的HTTPS页面（如在线版）向不安全的HTTP地址（如您的本地Ollama服务）发送请求。

**解决方案**：
为了绕过此限制，您需要让应用和API处于同一种协议下（例如，都是HTTP）。推荐以下方式：
1. **使用桌面版**：桌面应用没有浏览器限制，是连接本地模型最稳定可靠的方式
2. **使用Docker部署（HTTP）**：通过 `http://localhost:8081` 访问，与本地Ollama都是HTTP
3. **使用Chrome插件**：插件在某些情况下也可以绕过部分安全限制

### macOS 桌面应用问题

#### Q5: macOS 打开应用时提示「已损坏」或「无法验证开发者」怎么办？
**A**: 这是因为应用未经过 Apple 签名认证。由于 Apple 开发者账号费用较高，目前桌面应用暂未进行签名。

**解决方案**：
在终端中执行以下命令移除安全隔离属性：

```bash
# 对于已安装的应用
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PromptOptimizer.app

# 对于下载的 .dmg 文件（安装前执行）
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/PromptOptimizer-*.dmg
```

执行后重新打开应用即可正常使用。

&lt;/details&gt;

## Why Refly?

Most AI Agents fail in production because they rely on &quot;Vibe-coded&quot; scripts and fragile, black-box logic. As the ecosystem moves toward agentic frameworks like Claude Code, AutoGen, and MCP, the bottleneck is no longer the LLM—it&#039;s the lack of standardized, reliable actions.

Refly bridges the gap between raw APIs and intelligent agents. We allow you to codify messy business logic into structured, version-controlled Agent skills that any agent can invoke with 100% reliability.

**Stop hard-coding tools.** Build modular skills once in Refly&#039;s visual IDE and deploy them as MCP servers, standard APIs, or portable SDKs to any agent framework. &lt;a href=&quot;https://refly.ai/workspace&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Try it Now&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## Core Capabilities

### 🎯 Construct with Vibe (Copilot-led Builder)

Describe your business logic in natural language, and Refly&#039;s Model-Native DSL compiles your intent into a high-performance skill.

- **Intent-Driven Construction**: Describe the work once; Refly turns intent into deterministic, reusable, and composable skills.
- **Efficiency at Scale**: Streamlined DSL optimized for LLMs, ensuring fast execution and significantly lower token costs.
- **3-Minute Deployment**: Transition from a static enterprise SOP to a production-ready agent skill in under 3 minutes.

### ⚡ Execute with Control (Intervenable Runtime)

Break the &quot;black box&quot; of AI execution with a stateful runtime designed for deterministic reliability.

- **Intervenable Runtime**: Pause, audit, and re-steer agent logic mid-run to ensure 100% operational compliance.
- **Deterministic Guarantees**: Enforce strict business rules that minimize hallucinations and handle failure recovery.

### 🚀 Ship to Production (Unified Agent Stack)

Unify MCP integrations, tools, models, and reusable skills into a single execution layer.

- **Universal Delivery**: Export as APIs for Lovable, webhooks for Slack or Lark/Feishu, or native tools for Claude Code and Cursor.
- **Stable Scheduling**: Run workflows reliably on schedule with managed execution.

### 🏛️ Govern as Assets (Skill Registry)

Transform fragile scripts into governed, shared infrastructure across your organization.

- **Central Skill Registry**: Securely manage, version, and share agent capabilities.
- **Team Workspace Collaboration**: Build together with native version control and audit logs.

## Why Teams Choose Refly

### For Builders: From Vibe to Production

Most agent tooling today falls into two categories:

- Workflow builders (n8n, Dify): Great for orchestration, but workflows are fragile, trigger-only &quot;black boxes,&quot; and hard to reuse.
- Agent frameworks (LangChain): Powerful primitives, but require heavy engineering, manual boilerplate, and high maintenance to keep running.
Refly eliminates the friction of manual configuration, giving you the fastest path from a &quot;vibe&quot; to a usable agent tool. By using our Streamlined DSL, you get the speed of a GUI with the precision of code.

| Dimension | Legacy Automation &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(n8n, Dify)&lt;/sub&gt; | Code-First SDKs &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(LangChain)&lt;/sub&gt; | **Refly Skills** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction Depth** | Trigger-only &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Black box&lt;/sub&gt; | Programmatic &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Code changes&lt;/sub&gt; | **Intervenable runtime**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Steer logic mid-run&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Construction** | Manual API wiring &amp; JSON | Manual Python/TS boilerplate | **Copilot-led**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Describe intent → skills generated&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Recovery** | Fail = restart from scratch | Debug → redeploy → rerun | **Hot-fix**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Repair workflows during execution&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Portability** | Hard to reuse across environments | Framework-specific | **Export everywhere**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;To Claude Code, Cursor, Manus&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Deployment** | Limited function tools | Custom microservices | **Production Ready**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Stateful, validated APIs&lt;/sub&gt; |
### For Enterprise: Scalable Skills Governance

Workflow tools like n8n are great for basic connectivity, and frameworks like LangChain offer powerful primitives — but neither provides the governed, production-ready capability layer required for enterprise agent infrastructure.

Refly acts as the Agent skills builder, providing the governance and reliability infrastructure required to deploy AI across the entire organization.

| Enterprise Requirement | Legacy Tools &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(Workflow-first)&lt;/sub&gt; | SDKs &lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(Code-first)&lt;/sub&gt; | **Refly (Skill OS)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance &amp; Reuse** | Templates are copied and&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;reconfigured per instance&lt;/sub&gt; | No native registry&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;for sharing logic&lt;/sub&gt; | **Central skill registry**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Versioned, shareable capability assets&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Operational Reliability** | Trigger-based&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;limited recovery&lt;/sub&gt; | Custom handling required | **Stateful runtime**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;With validation + failure recovery&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **SOP Enforcement** | Workflows drift&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;across copies&lt;/sub&gt; | Depends on manual&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;engineering discipline&lt;/sub&gt; | **SOP-grade deterministic skills**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;With controlled execution&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Deployment** | Instance-bound workflows | Code maintained manually&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;per team&lt;/sub&gt; | **Local-first, on-prem ready**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Open-source infrastructure&lt;/sub&gt; |
| **Total Cost (TCO)** | Overhead grows with&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;workflow complexity&lt;/sub&gt; | High engineering&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;maintenance costs&lt;/sub&gt; | **Minimal DSL**&lt;br&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Reduces token spend&lt;/sub&gt; |

[![npm chrome-devtools-mcp package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/chrome-devtools-mcp.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/chrome-devtools-mcp)

`chrome-devtools-mcp` lets your coding agent (such as Gemini, Claude, Cursor or Copilot)
control and inspect a live Chrome browser. It acts as a Model-Context-Protocol
(MCP) server, giving your AI coding assistant access to the full power of
Chrome DevTools for reliable automation, in-depth debugging, and performance analysis.

## [Tool reference](./docs/tool-reference.md) | [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) | [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) | [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md) | [Design Principles](./docs/design-principles.md)

## Key features

- **Get performance insights**: Uses [Chrome
  DevTools](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend) to record
  traces and extract actionable performance insights.
- **Advanced browser debugging**: Analyze network requests, take screenshots and
  check browser console messages (with source-mapped stack traces).
- **Reliable automation**. Uses
  [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to automate actions in
  Chrome and automatically wait for action results.

## Disclaimers

`chrome-devtools-mcp` exposes content of the browser instance to the MCP clients
allowing them to inspect, debug, and modify any data in the browser or DevTools.
Avoid sharing sensitive or personal information that you don&#039;t want to share with
MCP clients.

Performance tools may send trace URLs to the Google CrUX API to fetch real-user
experience data. This helps provide a holistic performance picture by
presenting field data alongside lab data. This data is collected by the [Chrome
User Experience Report (CrUX)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux). To disable
this, run with the `--no-performance-crux` flag.

## **Usage statistics**

Google collects usage statistics (such as tool invocation success rates, latency, and environment information) to improve the reliability and performance of Chrome DevTools MCP.

Data collection is **enabled by default**. You can opt-out by passing the `--no-usage-statistics` flag when starting the server:

```json
&quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;, &quot;--no-usage-statistics&quot;]
```

Google handles this data in accordance with the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Google&#039;s collection of usage statistics for Chrome DevTools MCP is independent from the Chrome browser&#039;s usage statistics. Opting out of Chrome metrics does not automatically opt you out of this tool, and vice-versa.

Collection is disabled if CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_USAGE_STATISTICS or CI env variables are set.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.19 or a newer [latest maintenance LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) version.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) current stable version or newer.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Getting started

Add the following config to your MCP client:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;chrome-devtools&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Using `chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` ensures that your MCP client will always use the latest version of the Chrome DevTools MCP server.

### MCP Client configuration

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Amp&lt;/summary&gt;
  Follow https://ampcode.com/manual#mcp and use the config provided above. You can also install the Chrome DevTools MCP server using the CLI:

```bash
amp mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Antigravity&lt;/summary&gt;

To use the Chrome DevTools MCP server follow the instructions from &lt;a href=&quot;https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp&quot;&gt;Antigravity&#039;s docs&lt;/a&gt; to install a custom MCP server. Add the following config to the MCP servers config:

```bash
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;chrome-devtools&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;,
        &quot;--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9222&quot;,
        &quot;-y&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This will make the Chrome DevTools MCP server automatically connect to the browser that Antigravity is using. If you are not using port 9222, make sure to adjust accordingly.

Chrome DevTools MCP will not start the browser instance automatically using this approach as as the Chrome DevTools MCP server runs in Antigravity&#039;s built-in browser. If the browser is not already running, you have to start it first by clicking the Chrome icon at the top right corner.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Claude Code&lt;/summary&gt;
    Use the Claude Code CLI to add the Chrome DevTools MCP server (&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;):

```bash
claude mcp add chrome-devtools --scope user npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Cline&lt;/summary&gt;
  Follow https://docs.cline.bot/mcp/configuring-mcp-servers and use the config provided above.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Codex&lt;/summary&gt;
  Follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#model-context-protocol-mcp&quot;&gt;configure MCP guide&lt;/a&gt;
  using the standard config from above. You can also install the Chrome DevTools MCP server using the Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

**On Windows 11**

Configure the Chrome install location and increase the startup timeout by updating `.codex/config.toml` and adding the following `env` and `startup_timeout_ms` parameters:

```
[mcp_servers.chrome-devtools]
command = &quot;cmd&quot;
args = [
    &quot;/c&quot;,
    &quot;npx&quot;,
    &quot;-y&quot;,
    &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;,
]
env = { SystemRoot=&quot;C:\\Windows&quot;, PROGRAMFILES=&quot;C:\\Program Files&quot; }
startup_timeout_ms = 20_000
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Copilot CLI&lt;/summary&gt;

Start Copilot CLI:

```
copilot
```

Start the dialog to add a new MCP server by running:

```
/mcp add
```

Configure the following fields and press `CTRL+S` to save the configuration:

- **Server name:** `chrome-devtools`
- **Server Type:** `[1] Local`

### Your first prompt

Enter the following prompt in your MCP Client to check if everything is working:

```
Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com
```

Your MCP client should open the browser and record a performance trace.

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; The MCP server will start the browser automatically once the MCP client uses a tool that requires a running browser instance. Connecting to the Chrome DevTools MCP server on its own will not automatically start the browser.

## Configuration

The Chrome DevTools MCP server supports the following configuration option:

&lt;!-- BEGIN AUTO GENERATED OPTIONS --&gt;

- **`--autoConnect`/ `--auto-connect`**
  If specified, automatically connects to a browser (Chrome 144+) running in the user data directory identified by the channel param. Requires the remoted debugging server to be started in the Chrome instance via chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging.

  - **Type:** boolean
  - **Default:** `true`

&lt;!-- END AUTO GENERATED OPTIONS --&gt;

Pass them via the `args` property in the JSON configuration. For example:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;chrome-devtools&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;,
        &quot;--channel=canary&quot;,
        &quot;--headless=true&quot;,
        &quot;--isolated=true&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting via WebSocket with custom headers

You can connect directly to a Chrome WebSocket endpoint and include custom headers (e.g., for authentication):

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;chrome-devtools&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;,
        &quot;--wsEndpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/&lt;id&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;--wsHeaders={\&quot;Authorization\&quot;:\&quot;Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\&quot;}&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To get the WebSocket endpoint from a running Chrome instance, visit `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version` and look for the `webSocketDebuggerUrl` field.

You can also run `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --help` to see all available configuration options.

## Concepts

### User data directory

`chrome-devtools-mcp` starts a Chrome&#039;s stable channel instance using the following user
data directory:

- Linux / macOS: `$HOME/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile-$CHANNEL`
- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile-$CHANNEL`

The user data directory is not cleared between runs and shared across
all instances of `chrome-devtools-mcp`. Set the `isolated` option to `true`
to use a temporary user data dir instead which will be cleared automatically after
the browser is closed.

### Connecting to a running Chrome instance

By default, the Chrome DevTools MCP server will start a new Chrome instance with a dedicated profile. This might not be ideal in al

This project comes as a pre-built docker image that enables you to easily forward to your websites
running at home or otherwise, including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx or Letsencrypt.

- [Screenshots](https://nginxproxymanager.com/screenshots/)

## Project Goal

I created this project to fill a personal need to provide users with an easy way to accomplish reverse
proxying hosts with SSL termination and it had to be so easy that a monkey could do it. This goal hasn&#039;t changed.
While there might be advanced options they are optional and the project should be as simple as possible
so that the barrier for entry here is low.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jc21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://public.jc21.com/github/by-me-a-coffee.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; style=&quot;height: 51px !important;width: 217px !important;&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;


## Features

- Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on [Tabler](https://tabler.github.io/)
- Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx
- Free SSL using Let&#039;s Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates
- Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts
- Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users
- User management, permissions and audit log


## Hosting your home network

I won&#039;t go in to too much detail here but here are the basics for someone new to this self-hosted world.

1. Your home router will have a Port Forwarding section somewhere. Log in and find it
2. Add port forwarding for port 80 and 443 to the server hosting this project
3. Configure your domain name details to point to your home, either with a static ip or a service like DuckDNS or [Amazon Route53](https://github.com/jc21/route53-ddns)
4. Use the Nginx Proxy Manager as your gateway to forward to your other web based services

## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: &#039;docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest&#039;
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &#039;80:80&#039;
      - &#039;81:81&#039;
      - &#039;443:443&#039;
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

This is the bare minimum configuration required. See the [documentation](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/) for more.

3. Bring up your stack by running

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Handy

**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone&#039;s hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn&#039;t trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it&#039;s trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you&#039;re using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the [website](https://handy.computer)
   - **macOS**: Also available via [Homebrew cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/handy): `brew install --cask handy`
2. Install the application
3. Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## Known Issues &amp; Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11            | `xdotool`        | `sudo apt install xdotool`                         |
| Wayland        | `wtype`          | `sudo apt install wtype`                           |
| Both           | `dotool`         | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- You can manage global shortcuts outside of Handy and still control the app via signals. Sending `SIGUSR2` to the Handy process toggles recording on/off, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings. Example (Sway):

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy
  ```

  `pkill` here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don&#039;t meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Roadmap &amp; Active Development

We&#039;re actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### In Progress

**Debug Logging:**

- Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues

**macOS Keyboard Improvements:**

- Support for Globe key as transcription trigger
- A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS&#039;s too.

**Opt-in Analytics:**

- Collect anonymous usage data to help improve Handy
- Privacy-first approach with clear opt-in

**Settings Refactoring:**

- Cleanup and refactor settings system which is becoming bloated and messy
- Implement better abstractions for settings management

**Tauri Commands Cleanup:**

- Abstract and organize Tauri command patterns
- Investigate tauri-specta for improved type safety and organization

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Model Installation (For Proxy Users or Network Restrictions)

If you&#039;re behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handy cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.

#### Step 1: Find Your App Data Directory

1. Open Handy settings
2. Navigate to the **About** section
3. Copy the &quot;App Data Directory&quot; path shown there, or use the shortcuts:
   - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D` to open debug menu
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open debug menu

The typical paths are:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.pais.handy/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.pais.handy\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.pais.handy/`

#### Step 2: Create Models Directory

Inside your app data directory, create a `models` folder if it doesn&#039;t already exist:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.pais.handy/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path &quot;$env:APPDATA\com.pais.handy\models&quot;
```

#### Step 3: Download Model Files

Download the models you want from below

**Whisper Models (single .bin files):**

- Small (487 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin`
- Medium (492 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin`
- Turbo (1600 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`
- Large (1100 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin`

**Parakeet Models (compressed archives):**

- V2 (473 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz`
- V3 (478 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Install Models

**For Whisper Models (.bin files):**

Simply place the `.bin` file directly into the `models` directory:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
```

**For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):**

1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Place the **extracted directory** into the `models` folder
3. The directory must be named exactly as follows:
   - **Parakeet V2**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`
   - **Parakeet V3**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`

Final structure should look like:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
```

**Important Notes:**

- For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name **must** match exactly as shown above
- Do not rename the `.bin` files for Whisper models—use the exact filenames from the download URLs
- After placing the files, restart Handy to detect the new models

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Restart Handy
2. Open Settings → Models
3. Your manually installed models should now appear as &quot;Downloaded&quot;
4. Select the model you want to use and test transcription

### How to Contribute

1. **Check existing issues** at [github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues)
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Test thoroughly** on your target platform
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description of changes
5. **Join the discussion** - reach out at [contact@handy.computer](mailto:contact@handy.computer)

The goal is to create both a useful tool and a foundation for others to build upon—a well-patterned, simple codebase that serves the community.

# 👨‍💻 Installation

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; You&#039;ll need a Vulkan compatible GPU (Graphics Card) to upscale images. Many iGPUs (integrated graphics) do not work but, no harm in trying :)

# 🤓 FAQ

- **How does Upscayl work?**
  - Upscayl uses AI models to enhance your images by guessing what the details could be. It uses Real-ESRGAN and Vulkan architecture to achieve this. [Our backend](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn) is fully open-source under the AGPLv3 license.
- **I don&#039;t see a drastic change in my upscaled image. Why is that?**
  - Upscayl can enhance low resolution images and images that are pixelated but it cannot de-blur or do focus adjustment on your image. If your image is out-of-focus or totally blurred, Upscayl is not the right tool for it. Please use images that are similar to the [examples we&#039;ve given here.](COMPARISONS.MD)
- **Is there a CLI available?**
  - The CLI tool is called [upscayl-ncnn](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn).
- **Do I need a GPU for this to work?**
  - Yes, unfortunately. NCNN Vulkan requires a Vulkan-compatible GPU. Upscayl won&#039;t work with **most** iGPUs or CPUs. But hey, no harm in trying ;)
    - @Wyrdgirn has contributed a workaround for Windows and Linux in [#390](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/issues/390)! Nobody knows how to manipulate the macOS and Haiku frameworks...
- **I stopped the magic Batch Upscayl and my images haven&#039;t been processed, compressed, or are in the wrong scale!**
  - When a model doesn&#039;t support an action, Upscayl will finish upscayling all the images first before post-processing them. What this means is that you should simply **wait** for the process to finish.
- **How can I contribute?**
  - You can report issues, fix code and add features by submitting PRs, or donate! 😊
- **What&#039;s the GPU ID for?**
  - It is for selecting which GPU to use. The specific procedure is detailed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/wiki/Guide).
    - Note that for Windows systems, if Upscayl is not set to performance mode, the system may override this setting.
- **Where do I find more models?**
  -  More models can be taken from here: https://github.com/upscayl/custom-models

## Quick Start

```sh
# Install and initialize project
npx promptfoo@latest init

# Run your first evaluation
npx promptfoo eval
```

See [Getting Started](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/getting-started/) (evals) or [Red Teaming](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/) (vulnerability scanning) for more.

## What can you do with Promptfoo?

- **Test your prompts and models** with [automated evaluations](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- **Secure your LLM apps** with [red teaming](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/) and vulnerability scanning
- **Compare models** side-by-side (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, Ollama, and [more](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/providers/))
- **Automate checks** in [CI/CD](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/integrations/ci-cd/)
- **Review pull requests** for LLM-related security and compliance issues with [code scanning](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/code-scanning/)
- **Share results** with your team

Here&#039;s what it looks like in action:

![prompt evaluation matrix - web viewer](https://www.promptfoo.dev/img/claude-vs-gpt-example@2x.png)

It works on the command line too:

[Demo Video](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/assets/50181239/5348e44a-29a5-4280-a06b-fe1429a8d99e)


## 👨‍🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with AgentGPT is automatic setup CLI bundled with the project.
The cli sets up the following for AgentGPT:
- 🔐 [Environment variables](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/blob/main/.env.example) (and API Keys)
- 🗂️ [Database](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/tree/main/db) (Mysql)
- 🤖 [Backend](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/tree/main/platform) (FastAPI)
- 🎨 [Frontend](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/tree/main/next) (Nextjs)

## Prerequisites :point_up:

Before you get started, please make sure you have the following installed:

- An editor of your choice. For example, [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). After installation, please create an account, open up the Docker application, and sign in.
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- A [Serper API Key](https://serper.dev/signup) (optional)
- A [Replicate API Token](https://replicate.com/signin) (optional)

## Getting Started :rocket:
1. **Open your editor**

2. **Open the Terminal** - Typically, you can do this from a &#039;Terminal&#039; tab or by using a shortcut
   (e.g., `Ctrl + ~` for Windows or `Control + ~` for Mac in VS Code).

3. **Clone the Repository and Navigate into the Directory** - Once your terminal is open, you can clone the repository and move into the directory by running the commands below.

   **For Mac/Linux users** :apple: :penguin:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT.git
   cd AgentGPT
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   **For Windows users** :windows:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT.git
   cd AgentGPT
   ./setup.bat
   ```
4. **Follow the setup instructions from the script** - add the appropriate API keys, and once all of the services are running, travel to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your web-browser.

Happy hacking! :tada:

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Node Banana

&gt; **Important note:** This is in early development, it probably has some issues. Use Chrome. For support or raising any issues join the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/89Nr6EKkTf). See the [docs](https://node-banana-docs.vercel.app/) for help, installation guides, and user guides.

Node Banana is node-based workflow application for generating images with Nano Banana Pro. Build image generation pipelines by connecting nodes on a visual canvas. Recent Fal and Replicate integration allows for complex image and video pipelines from any provider, but be aware this is still in testing. 

Built mainly with Opus 4.5.

## Features

- **Prompt to Workflow** - Generate complete workflows from natural language descriptions or choose from preset templates (Gemini only for now)
- **Visual Node Editor** - Drag-and-drop nodes onto an infinite canvas with pan and zoom
- **Image Annotation** - Full-screen editor with drawing tools (rectangles, circles, arrows, freehand, text)
- **AI Image Generation** - Generate images using Google Gemini models
- **Text Generation** - Generate text using Google Gemini or OpenAI models
- **Workflow Chaining** - Connect multiple nodes to create complex pipelines
- **Save/Load Workflows** - Export and import workflows as JSON files
- **Group Locking** - Lock node groups to skip them during execution

## Multi-Provider Support (Beta)

In addition to Google Gemini, Node Banana now supports:
- **Replicate** - Access thousands of open-source models
- **fal.ai** - Fast inference for image and video generation

Configure API keys in Project Settings to enable these providers.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Node Editor**: @xyflow/react (React Flow)
- **Canvas**: Konva.js / react-konva
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API, OpenAI API, Replicate (Beta), fal.ai (Beta)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key      # Optional, for OpenAI LLM provider
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key  # Optional, beta
FAL_API_KEY=your_fal_api_key              # Optional, beta
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Example Workflows

The `/examples` directory contains some example workflow files from my personal projects. To try them:

1. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
2. Drag any `.json` file from the `/examples` folder into the browser window
3. Make sure you review each of the prompts before starting, these are fairly targetted to the examples. 

## Usage

1. **Add nodes** - Click the floating action bar to add nodes to the canvas
2. **Connect nodes** - Drag from output handles to input handles (matching types only)
3. **Configure nodes** - Adjust settings like model, aspect ratio, or drawing tools
4. **Run workflow** - Click the Run button to execute the pipeline
5. **Save/Load** - Use the header menu to save or load workflows

## Connection Rules

- **Image** handles connect to **Image** handles only
- **Text** handles connect to **Text** handles only
- Image inputs on generation nodes accept multiple connections
- Text inputs accept single connections

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test              # Watch mode
npm run test:run      # Single run
npm run test:coverage # With coverage report
```

## Contributions
PRs are welcome, please pull the latest changes from develop before creating a PR and make it to the develop branch, not master. Not that I&#039;m primarily making this for my own workflows, if the PR conflicts with my own plans I&#039;ll politely reject it. If you want to collaborate, consider joining the Discord and we can hash something out.
