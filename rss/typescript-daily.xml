This is server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of [MCP Filesystem Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities .

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements
  - vscode-ripgrep based recursive code or text search in folders

## Installation
First, ensure you&#039;ve downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Installing via Smithery

To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
```

### Option 2: Install trough npx
Just run this in terminal
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander setup
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 3: Add to claude_desktop_config by hand
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Mac, found at ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;desktop-commander&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 4: Checkout locally
1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run setup
```
Restart Claude if running

The setup command will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the server
- Configure Claude&#039;s desktop app
- Add MCP servers to Claude&#039;s config if needed

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata
- `code_search`: Recursive ripgrep based text and code search

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes &lt;20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes &gt;20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
console.log(&quot;old message&quot;);
=======
console.log(&quot;new message&quot;);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Model Context Protocol Integration

This project extends the MCP Filesystem Server to enable:
- Local server support in Claude Desktop
- Full system command execution
- Process management
- File operations
- Code editing with search/replace blocks

## Testimonials

[![It&#039;s a life saver! I paid Claude + Cursor currently which I always feel it&#039;s kind of duplicated. This solves the problem ultimately. I am so happy. Thanks so much. Plus today Claude has added the web search support. With this MCP + Internet search, it writes the code with the latest updates. It&#039;s so good when Cursor doesn&#039;t work sometimes or all the fast requests are used.](testemonials/img.png) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg
)

[![This is the first comment I&#039;ve ever left on a youtube video, THANK YOU! I&#039;ve been struggling to update an old Flutter app in Cursor from an old pre null-safety version to a current version and implemented null-safety using Claude 3.7. I got most of the way but had critical BLE errors that I spent days trying to resolve with no luck. I tried Augment Code but it didn&#039;t get it either. I implemented your MCP in Claude desktop and was able to compare the old and new codebase fully, accounting for the updates in the code, and fix the issues in a couple of hours. A word of advice to people trying this, be sure to stage changes and commit when appropriate to be able to undo unwanted changes. Amazing!](testemonials/img_1.png)

)

[![Great! I just used Windsurf, bought license a week ago, for upgrading old fullstack socket project and it works many times good or ok but also many times runs away in cascade and have to revert all changes loosing hundereds of cascade tokens. In just a week down to less than 100 tokens and do not want to buy only 300 tokens for 10$. This Claude MCP ,bought claude Pro finally needed but wanted very good reason to also have next to ChatGPT, and now can code as much as I want not worrying about token cost.
Also this is much more than code editing it is much more thank you for great video!](testemonials/img_2.png)

[![it is a great tool, thank you, I like using it, as it gives claude an ability to do surgical edits, making it more like a human developer.](testemonials/img_3.png)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=Ugy4-exy166_Ma7TH-h4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=Ugy4-exy166_Ma7TH-h4AaABAg)

[![You sir are my hero. You&#039;ve pretty much summed up and described my experiences of late, much better than I could have. Cursor and Windsurf both had me frustrated to the point where I was almost yelling at my computer screen. Out of whimsy, I thought to myself why not just ask Claude directly, and haven&#039;t looked back since.
Claude first to keep my sanity in check, then if necessary, engage with other IDEs, frameworks, etc. I thought I was the only one, glad to see I&#039;m not lol.

## 🤝 Contributing

If you are eligible to use Follow, you are welcome to join the open source community to build together.

Before you start, make sure you have enabled [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Corepack makes sure you are using the correct version (`packageManager` field in `package.json`) for package manager when you run corresponding commands.

```sh
corepack enable
```

Install dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Develop in the browser

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Then the browser opens `https://app.follow.is/__debug_proxy`，you can access the online API environment to development and debugging.

### Develop in the electron

You need to fill in the required environment variables first.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://api.follow.is` and run:

```sh
pnpm run dev:electron
```

Since it is not very convenient to develop in Electron, the first way to develop and contribute is recommended at this stage.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you can&#039;t log in to the app, copy the `__Secure-better-auth.session_token` in the cookie from your browser into the app.

const { visibleMessages, appendMessage, setMessages, ... } = useCopilotChat();

// Pre-built components with deep customization options (CSS + pass custom sub-components)
&lt;CopilotPopup 
  instructions={&quot;You are assisting the user as best as you can. Answer in the best way possible given the data you have.&quot;} 
  labels={{ title: &quot;Popup Assistant&quot;, initial: &quot;Need any help?&quot; }} 
/&gt;

    value: { rows: spreadsheet.rows.map((row) =&gt; ({ cells: row })) },
    enabled: !!activeCell &amp;&amp; !spreadsheetIsEmpty,
  },
  [activeCell, spreadsheet]
);
```

# Code Samples (CoAgents: in-app LangGraph Agents)

```ts
// Share state between app and agent
const { agentState } = useCoAgent({ 
  name: &quot;basic_agent&quot;, 
  initialState: { input: &quot;NYC&quot; } 
});

// agentic generative UI
useCoAgentStateRender({
  name: &quot;basic_agent&quot;,
  render: ({ state }) =&gt; &lt;WeatherDisplay {...state.final_response} /&gt;,
});

// Human in the Loop (Approval)
useCopilotAction({
    name: &quot;email_tool&quot;,
    parameters: [{ name: &quot;email_draft&quot;, type: &quot;string&quot;, description: &quot;The email content&quot;, required: true }],
    renderAndWaitForResponse: ({ args, status, respond }) =&gt; (
      &lt;EmailConfirmation
        emailContent={args.email_draft || &quot;&quot;}
        isExecuting={status === &quot;executing&quot;}
        onCancel={() =&gt; respond?.({ approved: false })}
        onSend={() =&gt; respond?.({ approved: true, metadata: { sentAt: new Date().toISOString() } })}
      /&gt;
    ),
  });

// ---

// intermediate agent state streaming (supports both LangGraph.js + LangGraph python)
const modifiedConfig = copilotKitCustomizeConfig(config, {
  emitIntermediateState: [{ 
    stateKey: &quot;outline&quot;, 
    tool: &quot;set_outline&quot;, 
    toolArgument: &quot;outline&quot; 
  }],

# how it works?

- we record everything 24/7, 100% locally, uses 10% CPU, 4 GB ram, 15 gb/m
- we index it into an api
- dev build ai apps w user&#039;s full context, desktop native, nextjs, publish, monetize

&lt;img src=&quot;./content/diagram2.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da5b8583-550f-4a1f-b211-058e7869bc91&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;



# why?

- ai models are commoditized 
- ai is as good as its context
- the most valuable context is all contained in your screen


## get started

macos, linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL get.screenpi.pe/cli | sh
```

or on windows

```bash
iwr get.screenpi.pe/cli.ps1 | iex
```

then

```bash
screenpipe
```

make sure to allow permissions on macos (screen, mic)

- [get the desktop app](https://screenpi.pe/)
- [docs &amp; build from source](https://docs.screenpi.pe/docs/getting-started)

## create plugins

```bash
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe create
```

screenpipe has a plugin system called &quot;pipe&quot; which lets you create desktop app in nextjs in a sandboxed environment within our Rust code, [read more](https://docs.screenpi.pe/docs/plugins)

you can then publish these to our store and make money:

```bash
cd foo
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe register --name foo [--paid --price 50] # subscription
bun run build
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe publish --name foo
```

***Elegant reading of real-time and hottest news***

## Features
- Elegant design for a pleasant reading experience, keeping you up-to-date with the latest and hottest news.
- Supports Github login and data synchronization.
- Default cache duration is 30 minutes. Logged-in users can force fetch the latest data. However, the scraping interval is adjusted based on the update frequency of the content sources (as fast as every two minutes) to save resources and prevent frequent scraping that could lead to IP bans.

## Deployment

If login and caching are not required, you can directly deploy to platforms like Cloudflare Pages or Vercel. Just fork the repository and import it into the respective platform.

For Cloudflare Pages, you need to set the build command to `pnpm run build` and the build output directory to `dist/output/public`.

For login, which involves GitHub OAuth, you only need to [create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). No special permissions are required. The callback URL should be `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain).

After creating the app, you will get a Client ID and Client Secret. Different platforms have different places to set environment variables; refer to the `example.env.server` file. If running locally, rename it to `.env.server` and add the necessary values.

```env
# Github Client ID
G_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

This project primarily supports deployment on Cloudflare Pages and Docker. For Vercel, you need to set up your own database. Supported databases can be found at https://db0.unjs.io/connectors .

The Cloudflare D1 database can be used for free. To set it up, go to the Cloudflare Worker control panel and manually create a D1 database. Then, add the `database_id` and `database_name` to the corresponding fields in your `wrangler.toml` file.

If you don&#039;t have a `wrangler.toml` file, you can rename `example.wrangler.toml` to `wrangler.toml` and modify it with your configuration. The changes will take effect on your next deployment.

For Docker deployment. In the project root directory with `docker-compose.yml`, run

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Development

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Node version &gt;= 20

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

If you want to add data sources, refer to the `shared/sources`, and `server/sources` directories. The project has complete types and a simple structure; feel free to explore.

## Installation

### Linux

#### Flatpak

[&lt;img src=&quot;https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flathub Badge&quot; width=&quot;10%&quot; /&gt;](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl)

Heroic is available on Flathub, so you should be able to easily install it on most distros with Software Centers (Pop!\_Shop, Discover, etc.)

#### Distribution-specific instructions

If you&#039;re not using the Flatpak version, make sure you have all Wine dependencies installed:
[Wine Dependencies](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md).

#### Debian, Ubuntu and Derivatives

Download the file ending in .deb from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest).  
Double-click it to open it up in your Software Manager, or run `sudo dpkg -i heroic_*_amd64.deb` to install it directly:

#### Arch (AUR)

We currently only support one AUR package: `heroic-games-launcher-bin`. Although you might find other packages there, do not ask support for them on this Github or on our Discord, ask their maintainers directly.

- [![Stable version badge](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/heroic-games-launcher-bin?style=flat&amp;label=heroic-games-launcher-bin)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin)  
  (stable release, recommended)

Please see [the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages) on how to install them

#### Fedora

##### COPR repo

Heroic for Fedora is available on [this COPR repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/heroic-games-launcher/).  
Enable it with `sudo dnf copr enable atim/heroic-games-launcher`, then install Heroic with `sudo dnf install heroic-games-launcher-bin`

##### Binary package from the releases page

You can alternatively download the file ending in .rpm from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest) and install it with `sudo dnf install ./heroic-*.x86_64.rpm`

#### Other Distributions (AppImage and TAR.XZ)

Since these two distribution formats don&#039;t have a form of dependency management, make sure the `curl` command is available. You might run into weird issues if it&#039;s not.

##### AppImage

- Download the file ending in .AppImage from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest)
- Make it executable (`chmod +x Heroic*.AppImage`)
- Run it (double-click in most file managers, or run `./Heroic*.AppImage`)

##### .tar.xz

- Download the file ending in .tar.xz from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest)
- Extract it anywhere
- Run the `heroic` file in the folder you extracted it to (double-click in most file managers, or run `./heroic`)

### Windows

#### WinGet

If you use WinGet (installed by default on Windows 11 and modern versions of 10), you can run `winget install Heroic` in a terminal to install Heroic.

#### Manual installl

Download the Heroic Installer (`Heroic-x.x.x-Setup.exe`) or the portable version (`Heroic-x.x.x-Portable.exe`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest). Run the executable you downloaded to install/run Heroic.  
The Setup will create shortcuts to Heroic on your Desktop and in your Start Menu.

### macOS

If you use Homebrew, you can run `brew install --cask --no-quarantine heroic` to install Heroic.  
Otherwise, download the file ending in .dmg from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest), double-click it to mount it, and drag the &quot;Heroic&quot; application into the &quot;Applications&quot; folder.

## Development environment

This part will walk you through setting up a development environment so you can build Heroic binaries yourself or make changes to the code.

1. Make sure Git, NodeJS, and pnpm 9 are installed  
   **NOTE**: On Windows, due to an issue with electron-builder, you&#039;ll need the standalone version of pnpm (`@pnpm/exe`)
   to build packages
2. Clone the repo and enter the cloned folder, for example with these commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher.git --recurse-submodules
   cd HeroicGamesLauncher
   ```

3. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `pnpm install`

### Building Heroic Binaries

Run the appropriate command for your OS:

- Build for Linux:

  ```bash
  pnpm dist:linux # Optionally specify a package to create (eg: deb, pacman, tar.xz, rpm, AppImage); default: AppImage
  ```

- Build for Windows:

  ```bash
  pnpm dist:win
  ```

- Build for Mac:
  ```bash
  pnpm dist:mac
  ```

### Building with VS Code

Instead of using the above commands to build Heroic, you can also use the Tasks in VSCode to build.
To do that, open up the command palette (Ctrl + P), type in &quot;task&quot; and press Space. You will then see 3 build tasks, &quot;Build for Linux&quot;, &quot;Build for Windows&quot;, and &quot;Build for MacOS&quot;. Click the one you want to run.

### Quickly testing/debugging Heroic on your own system

If you want to quickly test a change, or you&#039;re implementing features that require a lot of restarts, you can use Vite&#039;s development server to speed up the process:  
Go to the &quot;Run and Debug&quot; tab of VSCode and start the &quot;Launch Heroic (HMR &amp; HR)&quot; task (alternatively, if you&#039;re not using VSCode or just prefer the terminal, run `pnpm start`). Heroic will start up after a short while, and once you make any change to the code, it&#039;ll reload/restart.

## ⚡ Introduction

By constructing sentences with conjunctions, it helps you learn English better~ 😊

## 🚀 How To Start?

**The mentioned operations below are based on the root directory of the current project, please be attentive to ensure there are no errors!**

### Requirements

- **pnpm version &gt;= 8**

  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```

- **Node.js version &gt;= v20**
  &gt; Use the version from .node-version. [Supported tools](https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage#compatibility-testing)
- **Postgres version &gt;= 14.0.0**
- **Redis version &gt;= 5.0.0**
- **Docker**. please make sure it is installed and running successfully on your local machine.

```bash
docker --version # Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b

node --version # v20+

pnpm -v # 8+
```

### Editor

#### VSCode

- Install the recommended extensions [extensions.json](./.vscode/extensions.json)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure the `.env` File

You can choose to copy the contents of `./apps/api/.env.example` to`./apps/api/.env`. note that the&#039; example&#039; file contains sample configuration. the main storage system&#039;s environment variable information, such as database connection address, user name, password, port, key, etc. the back-end service will read the configuration from this file, **of course you can also change it to your own configuration information**.

Windows users recommend shortcut keys to copy and paste, Linux users can operate through the following command.

#### Server

```bash
cp ./apps/api/.env.example ./apps/api/.env
```

#### Client

```bash
cp ./apps/client/.env.example ./apps/client/.env
```

### 3. Restore Data Of Logto

Uncompress `logto_db_init_data.zip` to `.volumes/`

```bash
unzip logto_db_init_data.zip -d .volumes/
```

- Admin URL: http://localhost:3011
- Username: admin
- Password: WkN7g5-i8ZrJckX

&gt; if you want to [Manual Configuration Logto](https://github.com/cuixueshe/earthworm/wiki/%E8%BF%81%E7%A7%BB-Logto-%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%90%8E%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%EF%BC%88%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE%E8%80%85%EF%BC%89)

### 4. Start Docker Compose Service

The backend relies on Postgres and Redis services. Start and stop these services using the commands configured in `package.json` below.

```bash
# start
pnpm docker:start

# When needed, execute the following command
# stop
pnpm docker:stop
# delete
pnpm docker:delete
# Complete deletion (including Volume data)
pnpm docker:down
```

If you prefer manual, you can use the commands below.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose stop
docker compose down

# commands compatible with older versions of Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Initialize Database Schema

When executing this command, try to keep a little time from the previous command, because the `-d` parameter just used will suspend its service execution in the background. At this time, the docker service may still be running. If an error is found, execute it again.

```bash
pnpm db:init
```

### 6. Create and Upload Course Data

**Only Execute This During the Initial Database Initialization**.

```bash
pnpm db:upload
```

### 7. Start the Backend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:serve
```

### 8. Start the Frontend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:client
```

## 🛠️ About testing

**Run the test before submitting the commit, and submit the code after the test passes, so as to avoid multiple commits to solve the test problem**.

### Front-end Testing

The main is the single test of Vitest and the automated test of cypress, execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter the front-end project directory
cd apps/client

# vitest
pnpm test:unit:run
# cypress
pnpm test:e2e:run

# monitor vitest, convenient hot update to see test results
pnpm test:unit:watch
```

### Backend Testing

Mainly Jest single test and end-to-end test, but need to access the test database, so you need to ensure that:

1. testdb and testRedis services in Docker Compose started normally.
2. The configuration information in the `.env.test` file is correct. If there is no such file, you can copy the contents of the `apps/api/.env.test.example` file to the `apps/api/.env.test` file. The following command is provided to directly use.

Execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter Backend Project Directory
cd apps/api

# If you have an.env.test file, you don&#039;t need to run this step
cp .env.test.example .env.test

# Single test
pnpm test:unit
# End-to-end testing
pnpm test:e2e
# Single test and end-to-end test run together
pnpm test
```

## Docs Project

Project based on Vitepress documentation，execute the following command:

```bash
# Local Development
pnpm docs:dev
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Database connection failed

My Docker and the database inside are running normally, but when I run the `db:init` command, I still report an error, indicating that the database connection failed.

You can check whether the database configuration in the `.env` file is correct, or even whether this file has it! 😠

### How To Correctly Update Course Data?

when you identify incorrect course data and make modifications, you should use the following command to update the course data in the database.

```bash
pnpm db:update
```

### pnpm Install Error?

Some dependencies require compilation during installation, necessitating the presence of relevant build environments.
If these environments are not available, the compilation process may fail. Additionally, different modules may require different build environments, so specific issues need to be analyzed individually.
Below are specific problems encountered along with their solutions.

First try the following command to update `pnpm`.

```shell
pnpm i -g
# or
pnpm i -g pnpm
# or
npx pnpm i -g pnpm@latest
```

**Error Installing the argon2 Module On Windows**

- Install Visual Studio 2015 or later, specifically the &quot;Desktop development with C++&quot; component. (In practice, any component containing C++ development tools and libraries will suffice.)
- If you encounter Chinese characters display issues during compilation, execute `chcp 437` in the command prompt, then rerun the install command.

### Docker Permission Denied in Docker?

When using WSL2 as a development environment in Windows, the following error occurs when starting Docker with `docker compose up -d` :

```bash
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get &quot;http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json&quot;: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

&gt; Solution

Add the current user to the docker group

```bash
# Add docker user group
sudo groupadd docker
# Add the logged-in user to the docker user group
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
# Update user group
newgrp docker
# Test if docker command is working properly
docker images
```

## 🤝 Frontend Development Guideline

1. Do not Destructure Pinia store.

   - The readability will be better when using `store`
   - Destructuring can lead to reactivity loss and using `storeToRefs` is also quite cumbersome

2. Avoid including UI logic in composables.

   - Such as `toast.info()`
   - We categorize the router as UI logic, and for ease of testing, avoid including routerrelated logic in there

## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it&#039;s an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user&#039;s query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
- **API**: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI&#039;s models**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama&#039;s models instead of OpenAI&#039;s**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq&#039;s hosted models**.
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your Anthropic API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models**.

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. After populating the configuration run `npm i`.
4. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build`.
5. Finally, start the app by running `npm rum start`

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Ollama Connection Errors

If you&#039;re encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama&#039;s API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://&lt;private_ip_of_host&gt;:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you&#039;re using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment=&quot;OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0&quot;`. Then restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser&#039;s search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser&#039;s settings.
2. Navigate to the &#039;Search Engines&#039; section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser&#039;s search bar.

## Using Perplexica&#039;s API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Next.js SaaS Starter

This is a starter template for building a SaaS application using **Next.js** with support for authentication, Stripe integration for payments, and a dashboard for logged-in users.

**Demo: [https://next-saas-start.vercel.app/](https://next-saas-start.vercel.app/)**

## Features

- Marketing landing page (`/`) with animated Terminal element
- Pricing page (`/pricing`) which connects to Stripe Checkout
- Dashboard pages with CRUD operations on users/teams
- Basic RBAC with Owner and Member roles
- Subscription management with Stripe Customer Portal
- Email/password authentication with JWTs stored to cookies
- Global middleware to protect logged-in routes
- Local middleware to protect Server Actions or validate Zod schemas
- Activity logging system for any user events

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- **UI Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter
cd saas-starter
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Then, run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can, of course, create new users as well through `/sign-up`.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

Optionally, you can listen for Stripe webhooks locally through their CLI to handle subscription change events:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

## Testing Payments

To test Stripe payments, use the following test card details:

- Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiration: Any future date
- CVC: Any 3-digit number

## Going to Production

When you&#039;re ready to deploy your SaaS application to production, follow these steps:

### Set up a production Stripe webhook

1. Go to the Stripe Dashboard and create a new webhook for your production environment.
2. Set the endpoint URL to your production API route (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`).
3. Select the events you want to listen for (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`).

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and deploy it.
3. Follow the Vercel deployment process, which will guide you through setting up your project.

### Add environment variables

In your Vercel project settings (or during deployment), add all the necessary environment variables. Make sure to update the values for the production environment, including:

1. `BASE_URL`: Set this to your production domain.
2. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Use your Stripe secret key for the production environment.
3. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Use the webhook secret from the production webhook you created in step 1.
4. `POSTGRES_URL`: Set this to your production database URL.
5. `AUTH_SECRET`: Set this to a random string. `openssl rand -base64 32` will generate one.

## Other Templates

While this template is intentionally minimal and to be used as a learning resource, there are other paid versions in the community which are more full-featured:

## Intro

tRPC allows you to easily build &amp; consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

### Features

- ✅&amp;nbsp; Well-tested and production ready.
- 🧙‍♂️&amp;nbsp; Full static typesafety &amp; autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors.
- 🐎&amp;nbsp; Snappy DX - No code generation, run-time bloat, or build pipeline.
- 🍃&amp;nbsp; Light - tRPC has zero deps and a tiny client-side footprint.
- 🐻&amp;nbsp; Easy to add to your existing brownfield project.
- 🔋&amp;nbsp; Batteries included - React.js/Next.js/Express.js/Fastify adapters. _(But tRPC is not tied to React, and there are many [community adapters](https://trpc.io/docs/awesome-trpc#-extensions--community-add-ons) for other libraries)_
- 🥃&amp;nbsp; Subscriptions support.
- ⚡️&amp;nbsp; Request batching - requests made at the same time can be automatically combined into one
- 👀&amp;nbsp; Quite a few examples in the [./examples](./examples)-folder

## Quickstart

There are a few [examples](https://trpc.io/docs/example-apps) that you can use for playing out with tRPC or bootstrapping your new project. For example, if you want a Next.js app, you can use the full-stack Next.js example:

            <h2>README</h2><pre># HyprPanel 🚀

A panel built for Hyprland with [Astal](https://github.com/Aylur/astal)

![HyprPanel1](./assets/hp1.png)
![HyprPanel2](./assets/hp2.png)

&gt; NOTE: If you would like to support the project, please instead [donate to Aylur](https://ko-fi.com/aylur) who put in tremendous effort to build AGS. Hyprpanel likely wouldn&#039;t exist without it.

## Information

The [HyprPanel Wiki](https://hyprpanel.com/getting_started/installation.html) contains in depth instructions for configuring and installing the panel and all of its dependencies. The instructions below are just the general instructions for installing the panel.

## Arch

```bash
yay -S ags-hyprpanel-git
```

## From Source

### Required

```sh
aylurs-gtk-shell-git
wireplumber
libgtop
bluez
bluez-utils
networkmanager
dart-sass
wl-clipboard
upower
gvfs
```

**NOTE: HyprPanel will not run without the required dependencies.**

### Optional

```sh
## Used for Tracking GPU Usage in your Dashboard (NVidia only)
python
python-gpustat

## To control screen/keyboard brightness
brightnessctl

## Only if a pywal hook from wallpaper changes applied through settings is desired
pywal

## To check for pacman updates in the default script used in the updates module
pacman-contrib

## To switch between power profiles in the battery module
power-profiles-daemon

## To take snapshots with the default snapshot shortcut in the dashboard
grimblast

## To record screen through the dashboard record shortcut
wf-recorder

## To enable the eyedropper color picker with the default snapshot shortcut in the dashboard
hyprpicker

## To enable hyprland&#039;s very own blue light filter
hyprsunset

## To click resource/stat bars in the dashboard and open btop
btop

## To enable matugen based color theming
matugen

## To enable matugen based color theming and setting wallpapers
swww
```

### Arch

pacman:

```bash
 sudo pacman -S --needed wireplumber libgtop bluez bluez-utils btop networkmanager dart-sass wl-clipboard brightnessctl swww python upower pacman-contrib power-profiles-daemon gvfs
```

AUR:

```bash
yay -S --needed aylurs-gtk-shell-git grimblast-git wf-recorder-git hyprpicker matugen-bin python-gpustat hyprsunset-git
```

### Fedora

COPR - Add [solopasha/hyprland](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/solopasha/hyprland/) for most hyprland-related dependencies, and [hues-sueh/packages](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/heus-sueh/packages/) for matugen. Both provide the `swww` package, so prioritise the former repo:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable solopasha/hyprland
sudo dnf copr enable heus-sueh/packages
sudo dnf config-manager --save --setopt=copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:heus-sueh:packages.priority=200
```

DNF:

```sh
sudo dnf install wireplumber upower libgtop2 bluez bluez-tools grimblast hyprpicker btop NetworkManager wl-clipboard swww brightnessctl gnome-bluetooth aylurs-gtk-shell power-profiles-daemon gvfs nodejs wf-recorder
```

npm:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

#### Optional Dependencies

pip:

```bash
sudo dnf install python python3-pip; pip install gpustat pywal
```

### NixOS

For NixOS/Home-Manager, see [NixOS &amp; Home-Manager instructions](#nixos--home-manager).

## Installation

To install HyprPanel, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel.git
cd HyprPanel
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build
```

### Installing NerdFonts

HyprPanel uses [Nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to display icons. You can install them using the following command from within the HyprPanel&#039;s `scripts` directory:

```sh
# Installs the JetBrainsMono NerdFonts used for icons
./scripts/install_fonts.sh
```

If you install the fonts after installing HyperPanel, you will need to restart HyperPanel for the changes to take effect.

### NixOS &amp; Home-Manager

Alternatively, if you&#039;re using NixOS and/or Home-Manager, you can setup AGS using the provided Nix Flake. First, add the repository to your Flake&#039;s inputs, and enable the overlay.

```nix
# flake.nix

{
  inputs.hyprpanel.url = &quot;github:Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel&quot;;
  # ...

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs:
  let
    # ...
 system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;; # change to whatever your system should be.
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
   inherit system;
   # ...
   overlays = [
        inputs.hyprpanel.overlay
   ];
 };
  in {
    # ...
  }
}
```

Once you&#039;ve set up the overlay, you can reference HyprPanel with `pkgs.hyprpanel` as if it were any other Nix package. This means you can reference it as a NixOS system/user package, a Home-Manager user package, or as a direct reference in your Hyprland configuration (if your configuration is managed by Home-Manager). The first three methods will add it to your `$PATH` (first globally, second two user-only), however the final will not.

```nix
# configuration.nix

# install it as a system package
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # ...
  hyprpanel
  # ...
];

# or install it as a user package
users.users.&lt;username&gt;.packages = with pkgs; [
  # ...
  hyprpanel
  # ...
];


# home.nix

# install it as a user package with home-manager
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  # ...
  hyprpanel
  # ...
];

# or reference it directly in your Hyprland configuration
wayland.windowManager.hyprland.settings.exec-once = [
  &quot;${pkgs.hyprpanel}/bin/hyprpanel&quot;
];

```

For information on the Home Manager module, click [here](https://hyprpanel.com/getting_started/installation.html#nixos-home-manager).

### Launch the panel

Afterwards you can run the panel with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
hyprpanel
```

Or you can add it to your Hyprland config (hyprland.conf) to auto-start with:

```bash
exec-once = hyprpanel
```

### Notifications

HyprPanel handles notifications through the AGS built-in notification service. If you&#039;re already using a notification daemon such as Dunst or Mako, you may have to stop them to prevent conflicts with HyprPanel.

&gt; NOTE: If your system is in a language other than English, the resource monitor in the dashboard may not work properly.

## Features

-   Super easy to install (Download Installer, open, click install button, done)
-   100+ plugins built in: [See a list](https://vencord.dev/plugins)
    -   Some highlights: SpotifyControls, MessageLogger, Experiments, GameActivityToggle, Translate, NoTrack, QuickReply, Free Emotes/Stickers, PermissionsViewer, CustomCommands, ShowHiddenChannels, PronounDB
-   Fairly lightweight despite the many inbuilt plugins
-   Excellent Browser Support: Run Vencord in your Browser via extension or UserScript
-   Works on any Discord branch: Stable, Canary or PTB all work (though for the best experience I recommend stable!)
-   Custom CSS and Themes: Inbuilt css editor with support to import any css files (including BetterDiscord themes)
-   Privacy friendly, blocks Discord analytics &amp; crash reporting out of the box and has no telemetry
-   Maintained very actively, broken plugins are usually fixed within 12 hours
-   Settings sync: Keep your plugins and their settings synchronised between devices / apps (optional)

## Disclaimer

Discord is trademark of Discord Inc. and solely mentioned for the sake of descriptivity.
Mention of it does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by Discord Inc.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Using Vencord violates Discord&#039;s terms of service&lt;/summary&gt;

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Vencord in a server where you might get banned for it

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Rsdoctor is a build analyzer tailored for the [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) ecosystem and fully compatible with the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) ecosystem.

Rsdoctor is committed to being a one-stop, intelligent build analyzer that makes the build process transparent, predictable, and optimizable through visualization and smart analysis, helping development teams precisely identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and improve engineering quality.

Rsdoctor supports all tools and frameworks based on Rspack or webpack, such as: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-rsdoctor), [Rspeedy (Lynx)](https://lynxjs.org/rspeedy/), [Storybook](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [Re.Pack](https://re-pack.dev/), [Modern.js](https://modernjs.dev/), [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/), [Rspress](https://rspress.dev/) and [Rslib](https://lib.rsbuild.dev/).

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8bb4ebf-b823-47bc-91ab-2d74f0057ef7

## 🔥 Features

- **Compilation Visualization**: Rsdoctor visualizes the compilation behavior and time consumption, making it easy to view build issues.

- **Multiple Analysis Capabilities**: Rsdoctor supports build artifact, build-time analysis, and anti-degradation capabilities:

  - Build artifact support for resource lists and module dependencies, etc.
  - Build-time analysis supports Loader, Plugin, and Resolver building process analysis
  - Build rules support duplicate package detection and ES Version Check, etc.

- **Support Custom Rules**: In addition to built-in build scan rules, Rsdoctor also supports users adding custom component scan rules based on the build data of Rsdoctor.
