## Development

```bash
npm install          # Install all dependencies
npm run build        # Build all packages
npm run check        # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
./pi-test.sh         # Run pi from sources (must be run from repo root)
```

&gt; **Note:** `npm run check` requires `npm run build` to be run first. The web-ui package uses `tsc` which needs compiled `.d.ts` files from dependencies.

## ✨ Features

Today’s agents are one-off, task-driven tools. They lack context, live in isolation, and require manual hand-offs between different windows and models. While some maintain memory, it is often global, shallow, and impersonal. In this mode, users are forced to toggle between fragmented conversations, making it difficult to form structured productivity.

**LobeHub changes everything.**

LobeHub is a work-and-lifestyle space to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you. In LobeHub, we treat **Agents as the unit of work**, providing an infrastructure where humans and agents co-evolve.

![](https://hub-apac-1.lobeobjects.space/blog/assets/2204cde2228fb3f583f3f2c090bc49fb.webp)

### Create: Agents as the Unit of Work

Building a personalized AI team starts with the **Agent Builder**. You can describe what you need once, and the agent setup starts right away, applying auto-configurations so you can use it instantly.

- **Unified Intelligence**: Seamlessly access any model and any modality—all under your control.

[![][image-feat-privoder]][docs-feat-provider]

### [Multi-Model Service Provider Support][docs-feat-provider]

In the continuous development of LobeHub, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations.

In this way, LobeHub can more flexibly adapt to the needs of different users, while also providing developers with a wider range of choices.

#### Supported Model Service Providers

We have implemented support for the following model service providers:

&lt;!-- PROVIDER LIST --&gt;

[![][image-feat-vision]][docs-feat-vision]

### [Model Visual Recognition][docs-feat-vision]

LobeHub now supports OpenAI&#039;s latest [`gpt-4-vision`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) model with visual recognition capabilities,
a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box,
and the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this,
creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.

This feature opens up new interactive methods, allowing communication to transcend text and include a wealth of visual elements.
Whether it&#039;s sharing images in daily use or interpreting images within specific industries, the agent provides an outstanding conversational experience.

## MCP Server (Preview)

&gt; **Preview Feature**: This feature is experimental and may not be stable.

Use Next AI Draw.io with AI agents like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;drawio&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;@next-ai-drawio/mcp-server@latest&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add drawio -- npx @next-ai-drawio/mcp-server@latest
```

Then ask Claude to create diagrams:
&gt; &quot;Create a flowchart showing user authentication with login, MFA, and session management&quot;

The diagram appears in your browser in real-time!

See the [MCP Server README](./packages/mcp-server/README.md) for VS Code, Cursor, and other client configurations.

## Getting Started

## Deployment

### Deploy to EdgeOne Pages

You can deploy with one click using [Tencent EdgeOne Pages](https://pages.edgeone.ai/).

Deploy by this button: 

[![Deploy to EdgeOne Pages](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/pages/new?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDayuanJiang%2Fnext-ai-draw-io)

Check out the [Tencent EdgeOne Pages documentation](https://pages.edgeone.ai/document/deployment-overview) for more details.

Additionally, deploying through Tencent EdgeOne Pages will also grant you a [daily free quota for DeepSeek models](https://pages.edgeone.ai/document/edge-ai).

### Deploy on Vercel 

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDayuanJiang%2Fnext-ai-draw-io)

The easiest way to deploy is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), the creators of Next.js. Be sure to **set the environment variables** in the Vercel dashboard as you did in your local `.env.local` file.

See the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Deploy on Cloudflare Workers

[Go to Cloudflare Deploy Guide](./docs/en/cloudflare-deploy.md)



## Multi-Provider Support

-   [ByteDance Doubao](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/overview?briefPage=0&amp;briefType=introduce&amp;type=new&amp;utm_campaign=doubao&amp;utm_content=aidrawio&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_source=coopensrc&amp;utm_term=project)
-   AWS Bedrock (default)
-   OpenAI
-   Anthropic
-   Google AI
-   Google Vertex AI
-   Azure OpenAI
-   Ollama
-   OpenRouter
-   DeepSeek
-   SiliconFlow
-   ModelScope
-   SGLang
-   Vercel AI Gateway


All providers except AWS Bedrock and OpenRouter support custom endpoints.

📖 **[Detailed Provider Configuration Guide](./docs/en/ai-providers.md)** - See setup instructions for each provider.

### Server-Side Multi-Model Configuration

Administrators can configure multiple server-side models that are available to all users without requiring personal API keys. Configure via `AI_MODELS_CONFIG` environment variable (JSON string) or `ai-models.json` file.

**Model Requirements**: This task requires strong model capabilities for generating long-form text with strict formatting constraints (draw.io XML). Recommended models include Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and DeepSeek V3.2/R1.

Note that the `claude` series has been trained on draw.io diagrams with cloud architecture logos like AWS, Azure, GCP. So if you want to create cloud architecture diagrams, this is the best choice.


## How It Works

The application uses the following technologies:

-   **Next.js**: For the frontend framework and routing
-   **Vercel AI SDK** (`ai` + `@ai-sdk/*`): For streaming AI responses and multi-provider support
-   **react-drawio**: For diagram representation and manipulation

Diagrams are represented as XML that can be rendered in draw.io. The AI processes your commands and generates or modifies this XML accordingly.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Letta Code

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@letta-ai/letta-code.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@letta-ai/letta-code) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join-blue?style=flat-square&amp;logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/letta)

Letta Code is a memory-first coding harness, built on top of the Letta API. Instead of working in independent sessions, you work with a persisted agent that learns over time and is portable across models (Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2-Codex, Gemini 3 Pro, GLM-4.7, and more).

**Read more about how to use Letta Code on the [official docs page](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code).**

![](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-code/blob/main/assets/letta-code-demo.gif)

## Get started
Install the package via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):
```bash
npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code
```
Navigate to your project directory and run `letta` (see various command-line options [on the docs](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/commands)). 

Run `/connect` to configure your own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), and use `/model` to swap models.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;  By default, Letta Code will to connect to the [Letta API](https://app.letta.com/). Use `/connect` to use your own LLM API keys and coding plans (Codex, zAI, Minimax) for free. Set `LETTA_BASE_URL` to connect to an external [Docker server](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/docker).

## Philosophy 
Letta Code is built around long-lived agents that persist across sessions and improve with use. Rather than working in independent sessions, each session is tied to a persisted agent that learns.

**Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI** (Session-Based)
- Sessions are independent
- No learning between sessions
- Context = messages in the current session + `AGENTS.md`
- Relationship: Every conversation is like meeting a new contractor

**Letta Code** (Agent-Based)
- Same agent across sessions
- Persistent memory and learning over time
- `/clear` starts a new conversation (aka &quot;thread&quot; or &quot;session&quot;), but memory persists
- Relationship: Like having a coworker or mentee that learns and remembers

## Agent Memory &amp; Learning
If you’re using Letta Code for the first time, you will likely want to run the `/init` command to initialize the agent’s memory system:
```bash
&gt; /init
```

Over time, the agent will update its memory as it learns. To actively guide your agents memory, you can use the `/remember` command:
```bash
&gt; /remember [optional instructions on what to remember]
```
Letta Code works with skills (reusable modules that teach your agent new capabilities in a `.skills` directory), but additionally supports [skill learning](https://www.letta.com/blog/skill-learning). You can ask your agent to learn a skill from it&#039;s current trajectory with the command: 
```bash
&gt; /skill [optional instructions on what skill to learn]
```

Read the docs to learn more about [skills and skill learning](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/skills).

Community maintained packages are available for Arch Linux users on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/letta-code):
```bash
yay -S letta-code # release
yay -S letta-code-git # nightly
yay -S letta-code-bin # prebuilt release
```

A free and open-source file transfer tool that harnesses the power of [cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking](https://www.iroh.computer), letting you transfer files directly without storing them on cloud servers.

Why rely on WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can reliably and easily transfer files directly, end-to-end encrypted and without revealing any personal information?

[Drop your Email for receiving major project updates 📫](https://tally.so/r/ob2Vkx)

## Features

- **Send anywhere** – Works seamlessly on local networks or across continents.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is by downloading one of the following versions for your respective operating system:

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Windows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/tonyantony300/alt-sendme/releases/download/v0.3.1/AltSendme_0.3.1_x64-setup.exe&#039;&gt;AltSendme.exe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;macOS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/tonyantony300/alt-sendme/releases/download/v0.3.1/AltSendme_0.3.1_universal.dmg&#039;&gt;AltSendme.dmg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

## How it works 

1. Drop your file or folder - AltSendme creates a one-time share code (called a &quot;ticket&quot;).
2.  Share the ticket via chat, email, or text.
3. Your friend pastes the ticket in their app, and the transfer begins.


## Under the hood ⚙️🛠️

AltSendme uses [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer) under the hood to enable peer-to-peer file transfer. It is a modern modular alternative to technologies like WebRTC and libp2p.

### Important concepts 

- *Blobs*
- *Tickets*
- *Peer Discovery*, *Hole-punching* &amp; *NAT traversal*
- *QUIC* &amp; *End-to-end encryption*
- *Relays*


### 1. Blobs

Content-addressed blob storage and transfer. `iroh-blobs` implements request/response and streaming transfers of arbitrary-sized byte blobs, using BLAKE3-verified streams and content-addressed links.

- Blob: an opaque sequence of bytes (no embedded metadata).
- Link: a 32-byte BLAKE3 hash that identifies a blob.
- HashSeq: a blob that contains a sequence of links (useful for chunking/trees).
- Provider / Requester: provider serves data; requester fetches it. An endpoint can be both.

### 2. Tickets

Tickets are a way to share dialing information between iroh endpoints. They&#039;re a single token that contains everything needed to connect to another endpoint, or to fetch a blob in this case. Contains Ed25519 NodeIds: Your device&#039;s cryptographic identity for authentication.They&#039;re also very powerful. It&#039;s worth pointing out this setup is considerably better than full peer-2-peer systems, which broadcast your IP to peers. Instead in iroh, tickets are used to form a &quot;cozy network&quot; between peers you explicitly want to connect with. It&#039;s possible to go &quot;full p2p&quot; &amp; configure your app to broadcast dialing details, but tickets represent a better middle-ground default.


### 3. Peer Discovery, NAT Traversal &amp; Hole Punching

Peers register with an open-source public relay servers at startup to help traverse firewalls and NATs, enabling connection setup. Once connected, Iroh uses QUIC hole punching to try and establish a direct peer-to-peer connection, bypassing the relay. If direct connection is possible, communication happens directly between peers with end-to-end encryption; otherwise, the relay operates only temporarily as a fallback. This enables smooth reliable connections between peers within local-network and across the internet.

###  4. QUIC &amp; Encryption

QUIC is a modern transport protocol built on UDP, designed to reduce latency and improve web performance over TCP. Developed originally by Google and now standardized by the IETF as HTTP/3&#039;s foundation, it integrates TLS 1.3 encryption directly into the protocol.

QUIC allows following super-powers:
* encryption &amp; authentication
* stream multiplexing
    * no head-of-line blocking issues
    * stream priorities
    * one shared congestion controller
* an encrypted, unreliable datagram transport
* zero round trip time connection establishment if you&#039;ve connected to another endpoint before


### 5. Relays

AltSendme uses open-source public relay servers to support establishing direct connections, to speed up initial connection times, and to provide a fallback should direct connections between two endpoints fail or be impossible otherwise. All connections are end-to-end encrypted. The relay is “just another UDP socket” for sending encrypted packets around. [Read more.](https://docs.iroh.computer/about/faq)

## Troubleshooting

### 1. AltSendme Won&#039;t Launch on Windows (Missing Edge WebView2 Runtime)

#### Symptom

- When you double-click `AltSendme.exe`, nothing happens. No window appears, and Task Manager does not show the process.
- This can affect both the standard installer and the portable version.

#### Cause

- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is either missing, outdated, or improperly installed on your system.  
  AltSendme depends on WebView2 to render the interface on Windows.

#### How to Fix

1. **Check if WebView2 is installed**
   - Open **Add or Remove Programs** (a.k.a. *Apps &amp; features*) on Windows.
   - Look for **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime**.

2. **Install or Update WebView2**
   - Download the WebView2 Runtime directly from Microsoft: [link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?form=MA13LH).
   - If you prefer an offline installer, download the offline package and run it as an Administrator.

3. **Re-run AltSendme**
   - After installing/updating WebView2, launch `AltSendme.exe` again.
   - If you still encounter problems, reboot your PC and try again.

#### Additional Tips

- If reinstalling once doesn’t work, uninstall Edge WebView2 completely, then reinstall it with Administrator privileges.
- Verify your Windows installation has the latest updates from Microsoft.

#### Still Stuck?

- Head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xwb7z22Eve) server and open a support discussion with detailed logs of your environment and the steps you’ve taken.

There are many awesome books like &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎

### [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=kJSIoU)

This course by Design Gurus expands upon the questions on the recommended practice questions but approaches the practicing from a questions pattern perspective, which is an approach I also agree with for learning and have personally used to get better at coding interviews. The course allows you to practice selected questions in Java, Python, C++, JavaScript and also provides sample solutions in those languages. **Learn and understand patterns, not memorize answers!** [**Get lifetime access today →**](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=kJSIoU)

## Looking for Front End content?

Front-end-related content has been moved to a separate website - [Front End Interview Handbook](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com).

## Looking for System Design content?

We&#039;re still working on System Design content. In the meanwhile, check out [ByteByteGo&#039;s System Design Interview course](https://bytebytego.com?fpr=techinterviewhandbook) or Design Gurus&#039; [Grokking the System Design Interview course](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview?aff=kJSIoU), which in our opinion are among the most useful resources for getting started on system design interviews preparation.

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Tech ⌨

This app is created using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a Rust🦀 framework for building a cross-platform desktop app. It uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as a frontend layer. The compression is done entirely by [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) using platform specific standalone binaries.
The app works completely offline and no any network requests is made to/from the app.

### Downloads ⬇️

Download installers for the specific platform can be accessed from the [releases](https://github.com/codeforreal1/compressO/releases) page.

&lt;strong&gt;Installer Info:&lt;/strong&gt;

- `CompressO_amd64.deb`: Debian derivative of Linux like Ubuntu
- `CompressO_amd64.AppImage`: Universal package for all Linux distros
- `CompressO_aarch64.dmg` : For Macbooks with Apple Silicon Chips
- `CompressO_x64.dmg` : For Macbooks with Intel Chip
- `CompressO_x64.msi`: Windows 64 bit
- `CompressO_x86.msi`: Windows 32 bit

### Roadmap 🏁

- [x] Cancel during compression
- [x] Drag &amp; Drop video
- [x] Mute video
- [ ] Batch compression
      ...

### FAQs ❓

1.  &lt;strong&gt; MacOS: &quot;CompressO&quot; is damaged and can&#039;t be opened. You should move it to trash. &lt;/strong&gt;
    ![&quot;CompressO&quot; is damaged and can&#039;t be opened. You should move it to trash.](assets/image.png)
    &lt;p&gt;
    This error is shown by Apple to gatekeep app developers from using their apps unless it&#039;s signed by Apple after paying $100/year fee. The message is completely misleading since the app is not damaged at all. Since this is a free app, I&#039;m not going to go Apple&#039;s route just to appease them to make people trust my app. Here&#039;s a simple solution for this issue. Open your terminal and run the command:
    &lt;/p&gt;

        ```
        xattr -cr /Applications/CompressO.app
        ```

      &lt;p&gt;
           If you don&#039;t feel comfortable applying the above solution, you can simply move the app to trash (which also means you cannot use CompressO on your Mac).
        &lt;/p&gt;

2.  &lt;strong&gt; MacOS: &quot;CompressO&quot; cannot be opened because developer cannot be verified. &lt;/strong&gt;

    ![&quot;CompressO&quot; cannot be opened because developer cannot be verified.](assets/image-1.png)

      &lt;p&gt;
        This error is same as the one above on FAQ 1. It&#039;s just, Apple made the message different to scare the end user. Please have a look at the solution above.
          &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;

3.  &lt;strong&gt;Windows: Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.&lt;/strong&gt;
    ![alt text](assets/image-2.png)

    This is because you downloaded the windows installer from outside source and Windows Defender is warning you before installation. You can simply click on &quot;More Info&quot; and proceed with the installation.

4.  &lt;strong&gt;App not working on Debian 13 &amp; Ubuntu 24 &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Tauri seems to be missing some packages that was removed in Debian 13 and it&#039;s derivatives like Ubuntu 24. Tauri team is investigating the issue. No solution atm, unfortunately.
    &lt;/p&gt;
