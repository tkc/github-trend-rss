### Installation

```bash
# YOLO
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Package managers
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest        # or bun/pnpm/yarn
brew install sst/tap/opencode      # macOS and Linux
paru -S opencode-bin               # Arch Linux
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Documentation

For more info on how to configure opencode [**head over to our docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).

### Contributing

opencode is an opinionated tool so any fundamental feature needs to go through a
design process with the core team.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; We do not accept PRs for core features.

However we still merge a ton of PRs - you can contribute:

- Bug fixes
- Improvements to LLM performance
- Support for new providers
- Fixes for env specific quirks
- Missing standard behavior
- Documentation

Take a look at the git history to see what kind of PRs we end up merging.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you do not follow the above guidelines we might close your PR.

To run opencode locally you need.

- Bun
- Golang 1.24.x

And run.

```bash
$ bun install
$ bun dev
```

#### Development Notes

**API Client**: After making changes to the TypeScript API endpoints in `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts`, you will need the opencode team to generate a new stainless sdk for the clients.

### FAQ

#### How is this different than Claude Code?

It&#039;s very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although Anthropic is recommended, opencode can be used with OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- A focus on TUI. opencode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what&#039;s possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow opencode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What&#039;s the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).

**Stay on top of trending topics on social media — all in one place.**

Trend Finder collects and analyzes posts from key influencers, then sends a Slack or Discord notification when it detects new trends or product launches. This has been a complete game-changer for the Firecrawl marketing team by:

- **Saving time** normally spent manually searching social channels
- **Keeping you informed** of relevant, real-time conversations
- **Enabling rapid response** to new opportunities or emerging industry shifts

_Spend less time hunting for trends and more time creating impactful campaigns._

            <h2>README</h2><pre># x402 payments protocol

&gt; &quot;1 line of code to accept digital dollars. No fee, 2 second settlement, $0.001 minimum payment.&quot;

```typescript
app.use(
  // How much you want to charge, and where you want the funds to land
  paymentMiddleware(&quot;0xYourAddress&quot;, { &quot;/your-endpoint&quot;: &quot;$0.01&quot; })
);
// That&#039;s it! See examples/typescript/servers/express.ts for a complete example. Instruction below for running on base-sepolia.
```

## Philosophy

Payments on the internet are fundamentally flawed. Credit Cards are high friction, hard to accept, have minimum payments that are far too high, and don&#039;t fit into the programmatic nature of the internet.
It&#039;s time for an open, internet-native form of payments. A payment rail that doesn&#039;t have high minimums + % based fee. Payments that are amazing for humans and AI agents.

## Principles

- **Open standard:** the x402 protocol will never force reliance on a single party
- **HTTP Native:** x402 is meant to seamlessly complement the existing HTTP request made by traditional web services, it should not mandate additional requests outside the scope of a typical client / server flow.
- **Chain and token agnostic:** we welcome contributions that add support for new chains, signing standards, or schemes, so long as they meet our acceptance criteria laid out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Trust minimizing:** all payment schemes must not allow for the facilitator or resource server to move funds, other than in accordance with client intentions
- **Easy to use:** x402 needs to be 10x better than existing ways to pay on the internet. This means abstracting as many details of crypto as possible away from the client and resource server, and into the facilitator. This means the client/server should not need to think about gas, rpc, etc.

## Ecosystem

The x402 ecosystem is growing! Check out our [ecosystem page](https://x402.org/ecosystem) to see projects building with x402, including:

- Client-side integrations
- Services and endpoints
- Ecosystem infrastructure and tooling
- Learning and community resources

Want to add your project to the ecosystem? See our [demo site README](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/typescript/site#adding-your-project-to-the-ecosystem) for detailed instructions on how to submit your project.

**Roadmap:** see [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

## Terms:

- `resource`: Something on the internet. This could be a webpage, file server, RPC service, API, any resource on the internet that accepts HTTP / HTTPS requests.
- `client`: An entity wanting to pay for a resource.
- `facilitator server`: A server that facilitates verification and execution of on-chain payments.
- `resource server`: An HTTP server that provides an API or other resource for a client.

## Technical Goals:

- Permissionless and secure for clients and servers
- Gasless for client and resource servers
- Minimal integration for the resource server and client (1 line for the server, 1 function for the client)
- Ability to trade off speed of response for guarantee of payment
- Extensible to different payment flows and chains

## V1 Protocol

The `x402` protocol is a chain agnostic standard for payments on top of HTTP, leverage the existing `402 Payment Required` HTTP status code to indicate that a payment is required for access to the resource.

It specifies:

1. A schema for how servers can respond to clients to facilitate payment for a resource (`PaymentRequirements`)
2. A standard header `X-PAYMENT` that is set by clients paying for resources
3. A standard schema and encoding method for data in the `X-PAYMENT` header
4. A recommended flow for how payments should be verified and settled by a resource server
5. A REST specification for how a resource server can perform verification and settlement against a remote 3rd party server (`facilitator`)
6. A specification for a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header that can be used by resource servers to communicate blockchain transactions details to the client in their HTTP response

### V1 Protocol Sequencing

![](./static/x402-protocol-flow.png)

The following outlines the flow of a payment using the `x402` protocol. Note that steps (1) and (2) are optional if the client already knows the payment details accepted for a resource.

1. `Client` makes an HTTP request to a `resource server`.

2. `Resource server` responds with a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

3. `Client` selects one of the `paymentRequirements` returned by the server response and creates a `Payment Payload` based on the `scheme` of the `paymentRequirements` they have selected.

4. `Client` sends the HTTP request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the `Payment Payload` to the resource server.

5. `Resource server` verifies the `Payment Payload` is valid either via local verification or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment Requirements` to the `/verify` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

6. `Facilitator server` performs verification of the object based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload` and returns a `Verification Response`.

7. If the `Verification Response` is valid, the resource server performs the work to fulfill the request. If the `Verification Response` is invalid, the resource server returns a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

8. `Resource server` either settles the payment by interacting with a blockchain directly, or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment PaymentRequirements` to the `/settle` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

9. `Facilitator server` submits the payment to the blockchain based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload`.

10. `Facilitator server` waits for the payment to be confirmed on the blockchain.

11. `Facilitator server` returns a `Payment Execution Response` to the resource server.

12. `Resource server` returns a `200 OK` response to the `Client` with the resource they requested as the body of the HTTP response, and a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing the `Settlement Response` as Base64 encoded JSON if the payment was executed successfully.

### Type Specifications

#### Data types

**Payment Required Response**

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: int,

  // List of payment requirements that the resource server accepts. A resource server may accept on multiple chains, or in multiple currencies.
  accepts: [paymentRequirements]

  // Message from the resource server to the client to communicate errors in processing payment
  error: string
}
```

**paymentRequirements**

```json5
{
  // Scheme of the payment protocol to use
  scheme: string;

  // Network of the blockchain to send payment on
  network: string;

  // Maximum amount required to pay for the resource in atomic units of the asset
  maxAmountRequired: uint256 as string;

  // URL of resource to pay for
  resource: string;

  // Description of the resource
  description: string;

  // MIME type of the resource response
  mimeType: string;

  // Output schema of the resource response
  outputSchema?: object | null;

  // Address to pay value to
  payTo: string;

  // Maximum time in seconds for the resource server to respond
  maxTimeoutSeconds: number;

  // Address of the EIP-3009 compliant ERC20 contract
  asset: string;

  // Extra information about the payment details specific to the scheme
  // For `exact` scheme on a EVM network, expects extra to contain the records `name` and `version` pertaining to asset
  extra: object | null;
}
```

**`Payment Payload`** (included as the `X-PAYMENT` header in base64 encoded json)

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: number;

  // scheme is the scheme value of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  scheme: string;

  // network is the network id of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  network: string;

  // payload is scheme dependent
  payload: &lt;scheme dependent&gt;;
}
```

#### Facilitator Types &amp; Interface

A `facilitator server` is a 3rd party service that can be used by a `resource server` to verify and settle payments, without the `resource server` needing to have access to a blockchain node or wallet.

**POST /verify**. Verify a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:
  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    isValid: boolean;
    invalidReason: string | null;
  }
  ```

**POST /settle**. Settle a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:

  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```

- Response:

  ```json5
  {
    // Whether the payment was successful
    success: boolean;

    // Error message from the facilitator server
    error: string | null;

    // Transaction hash of the settled payment
    txHash: string | null;

    // Network id of the blockchain the payment was settled on
    networkId: string | null;
  }
  ```

**GET /supported**. Get supported payment schemes and networks:

- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    kinds: [
      {
        &quot;scheme&quot;: string,
        &quot;network&quot;: string,
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Schemes

A scheme is a logical way of moving money.

Blockchains allow for a large number of flexible ways to move money. To help facilitate an expanding number of payment use cases, the `x402` protocol is extensible to different ways of settling payments via its `scheme` field.

Each payment scheme may have different operational functionality depending on what actions are necessary to fulfill the payment.
For example `exact`, the first scheme shipping as part of the protocol, would have different behavior than `upto`. `exact` transfers a specific amount (ex: pay $1 to read an article), while a theoretical `upto` would transfer up to an amount, based on the resources consumed during a request (ex: generating tokens from an LLM).

See `specs/schemes` for more details on schemes, and see `specs/schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md` to see the first proposed scheme for exact payment on EVM chains.

### Schemes vs Networks

Because a scheme is a logical way of moving money, the way a scheme is implemented can be different for different blockchains. (ex: the way you need to implement `exact` on Ethereum is very different from the way you need to implement `exact` on Solana).

Clients and facilitators must explicitly support different `(scheme, network)` pairs in order to be able to create proper payloads and verify / settle payments.

## Running example

**Requirements:** Node.js v24 or higher

1. From `examples/typescript` run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to ensure all dependent packages and examples are setup.

2. Select a server, i.e. express, and `cd` into that example. Add your server&#039;s ethereum address to get paid to into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

3. Select a client, i.e. axios, and `cd` into that example. Add your private key for the account making payments into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

You should see activities in the client terminal, which will display a weather report.

## Running tests

1. Navigate to the typescript directory: `cd typescript`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the unit tests: `pnpm test`

This will run the unit tests for the x402 packages.

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

## Features

**A true canvas for blocks in any form. Docs and whiteboard are now fully merged.**

- Many editor apps claim to be a canvas for productivity, but AFFiNE is one of the very few which allows you to put any building block on an edgeless canvas -- rich text, sticky notes, any embedded web pages, multi-view databases, linked pages, shapes and even slides. We have it all.

**Multimodal AI partner ready to kick in any work**

- Write up professional work report? Turn an outline into expressive and presentable slides? Summary an article into a well-structured mindmap? Sorting your job plan and backlog for tasks? Or... draw and code prototype apps and web pages directly all with one prompt? With you, [AFFiNE AI](https://affine.pro/ai) pushes your creativity to the edge of your imagination, just like [Canvas AI](https://affine.pro/blog/best-canvas-ai) to generate mind map for brainstorming.

**Local-first &amp; Real-time collaborative**

- We love the idea of local-first that you always own your data on your disk, in spite of the cloud. Furthermore, AFFiNE supports real-time sync and collaborations on web and cross-platform clients.

**Self-host &amp; Shape your own AFFiNE**

- You have the freedom to manage, self-host, fork and build your own AFFiNE. Plugin community and third-party blocks are coming soon. More tractions on [Blocksuite](https://blocksuite.io). Check there to learn how to [self-host AFFiNE](https://docs.affine.pro/self-host-affine).

## Acknowledgement

“We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us”. A lot of pioneers have inspired us along the way, e.g.:

- Quip &amp; Notion with their great concept of “everything is a block”
- Trello with their Kanban
- Airtable &amp; Miro with their no-code programmable datasheets
- Miro &amp; Whimiscal with their edgeless visual whiteboard
- Remote &amp; Capacities with their object-based tag system

There is a large overlap of their atomic “building blocks” between these apps. They are not open source, nor do they have a plugin system like Vscode for contributors to customize. We want to have something that contains all the features we love and also goes one step even further.

Thanks for checking us out, we appreciate your interest and sincerely hope that AFFiNE resonates with you! 🎵 Checking https://affine.pro/ for more details ions.

**You are looking at the now inactive repository for Vue 2. The actively maintained repository for the latest version of Vue is [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core).**

Vue has reached End of Life on December 31st, 2023. It no longer receives new features, updates, or fixes. However, it is still available on all existing distribution channels (CDNs, package managers, Github, etc).

If you are starting a new project, please start with the latest version of Vue (3.x). We also strongly recommend current Vue 2 users to upgrade ([guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/)), but we also acknowledge that not all users have the bandwidth or incentive to do so. If you have to stay on Vue 2 but also have compliance or security requirements about unmaintained software, check out [Vue 2 NES](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-vue?utm_source=vuejs-github&amp;utm_medium=vue2-readme).

## Introduction

Vue (pronounced `/vjuː/`, like view) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Vue.js supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).

## What is Hyprnote?

Hyprnote is a local-first AI notepad designed for people in back-to-back meetings.

- Listens to your meetings while you write
- Crafts smart summaries based on your quick notes
- Runs completely **offline** using open-source models like Whisper or HyprLLM

No clouds. No leaks. Just your notes—on your machine.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap fastrepl/hyprnote &amp;&amp; brew install hyprnote --cask
```

- [macOS](https://hyprnote.com/download) (public beta)
- [Windows](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/66) (soon)
- [Linux](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/67) (of course)

## Highlights

### Realtime Transcript
Watch a live transcript update as the meeting unfolds—accurate, fast, and fully local.
&lt;img width=&quot;959&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d24b8b43-a052-44cd-803e-daa3ff600a9c&quot; /&gt;

### From Memos to Summaries
Jot things down during your call. Hyprnote turns them into a polished meeting summary—context-aware and easy to share.
&lt;img width=&quot;959&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/489f9239-1a32-4217-9d74-554906687fe1&quot; /&gt;

### Truly Local
No internet? No problem. Hyprnote works offline by default and keeps everything on your device.

![offline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6649a63-3d41-40ea-a1fd-8c0713ad91bc)

### Bring Your Own LLM
Prefer something custom? You can swap in your own language model:

- Run local models via Ollama
- Use approved third-party APIs like Gemini, Claude, or Azure-hosted GPT
- Stay compliant with whatever your org allows

Hyprnote plays nice with whatever stack you’re running.

&lt;img width=&quot;912&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/717dc39a-3359-46d6-a92f-51de56907750&quot; /&gt;

### Note Templates
Prefer a certain style? Choose from predefined templates like bullet points, agenda-based, or paragraph summary. Or create your own.

&lt;img width=&quot;959&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d826a854-4b6f-415c-9e97-270f517c0868&quot; /&gt;

### Autonomy Selector
Control how much freedom the AI takes:

- Stick strictly to your quick notes
- Let Hyprnote improvise and reframe based on the full conversation

&lt;img width=&quot;912&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7de5c74f-5d99-46ec-8a5f-a38fb62bafb1&quot; /&gt;

### AI Chat
Ask follow-ups right inside your notes:

- &quot;What were the action items?&quot;
- &quot;Rewrite this in simpler language&quot;
- &quot;Translate to Spanish&quot;

&lt;img width=&quot;959&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b7dc14-906f-445f-91f9-b0089d40a495&quot; /&gt;

## Legal

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply contains user-submitted links to publicly available video stream URLs, which to the best of our knowledge have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/pulls) or opening an [issue](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/new?assignees=freearhey&amp;labels=removal+request&amp;template=--removal-request.yml&amp;title=Remove%3A+). However, note that we have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus this is **not** a valid reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from the web, you should contact the web host that&#039;s actually hosting the content (**not** GitHub, nor the maintainers of this repository).

## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 100,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

## What is this?

Not everyone has the time to do a few hundred LeetCode questions. Here are _free and curated_ technical interview preparation materials for busy engineers, brought to you by me, the author of [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU). Over 1,000,000 people have benefitted from this handbook!

Besides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff includes:

- [Best practice questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) for coding interviews
- [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/) - the next evolution of Blind 75, bigger and better
- [How to prepare](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/) for coding interviews
- [Coding interview best practices](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-cheatsheet/) - Straight-to-the-point Do&#039;s and Don&#039;ts
- [Algorithm cheatsheets and tips](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) categorized by topic
- [Step-by-step Software Engineer resume guide](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/) to prepare a FAANG-ready resume
- [Behavioral questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview-questions/) asked by the top tech companies
- [Front end interview preparation](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com)

Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why would you read this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful.

The information in this repository is condensed. Ultimately, the key to succeeding in technical interviews is consistent practice and I don&#039;t want to bore you with too many words. I tell you the minimum you need to know on how to go about navigating the interview process, you go and practice and land your dream job.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

## How is this repository different?

There are many awesome books like &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Starter Workflows

These are the workflow files for helping people get started with GitHub Actions.  They&#039;re presented whenever you start to create a new GitHub Actions workflow.

**If you want to get started with GitHub Actions, you can use these starter workflows by clicking the &quot;Actions&quot; tab in the repository where you want to create a workflow.**

&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/353A3p3Y2x3c2t2N0c01/Image%202019-08-27%20at%203.25.07%20PM.png&quot; max-width=&quot;75%&quot;/&gt;

### Note

Thank you for your interest in this GitHub repo, however, right now we are not taking contributions. 

We continue to focus our resources on strategic areas that help our customers be successful while making developers&#039; lives easier. While GitHub Actions remains a key part of this vision, we are allocating resources towards other areas of Actions and are not taking contributions to this repository at this time. The GitHub public roadmap is the best place to follow along for any updates on features we’re working on and what stage they’re in.

We are taking the following steps to better direct requests related to GitHub Actions, including:

1. We will be directing questions and support requests to our [Community Discussions area](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/actions)

2. High Priority bugs can be reported through Community Discussions or you can report these to our support team https://support.github.com/contact/bug-report.

3. Security Issues should be handled as per our [security.md](security.md)

We will still provide security updates for this project and fix major breaking changes during this time.

You are welcome to still raise bugs in this repo.

### Directory structure

* [ci](ci): solutions for Continuous Integration workflows
* [deployments](deployments): solutions for Deployment workflows
* [automation](automation): solutions for automating workflows
* [code-scanning](code-scanning): solutions for [Code Scanning](https://github.com/features/security)
* [pages](pages): solutions for Pages workflows
* [icons](icons): svg icons for the relevant template

Each workflow must be written in YAML and have a `.yml` extension. They also need a corresponding `.properties.json` file that contains extra metadata about the workflow (this is displayed in the GitHub.com UI).

For example: `ci/django.yml` and `ci/properties/django.properties.json`.

### Valid properties

* `name`: the name shown in onboarding. This property is unique within the repository.
* `description`: the description shown in onboarding
* `iconName`: the icon name in the relevant folder, for example, `django` should have an icon `icons/django.svg`. Only SVG is supported at this time. Another option is to use [octicon](https://primer.style/octicons/). The format to use an octicon is `octicon &lt;&lt;icon name&gt;&gt;`. Example: `octicon person`
* `creator`: creator of the template shown in onboarding. All the workflow templates from an author will have the same `creator` field.
* `categories`: the categories that it will be shown under. Choose at least one category from the list [here](#categories). Further, choose the categories from the list of languages available [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) and the list of tech stacks available [here](https://github.com/github-starter-workflows/repo-analysis-partner/blob/main/tech_stacks.yml). When a user views the available templates, those templates that match the language and tech stacks will feature more prominently.

### Categories
* continuous-integration
* deployment
* testing
* code-quality
* code-review
* dependency-management
* monitoring
* Automation
* utilities
* Pages
* Hugo

### Variables
These variables can be placed in the starter workflow and will be substituted as detailed below:

* `$default-branch`: will substitute the branch from the repository, for example `main` and `master`
* `$protected-branches`: will substitute any protected branches from the repository
* `$cron-daily`: will substitute a valid but random time within the day

## How to test templates before publishing

### Disable template for public
The template author adds a `labels` array in the template&#039;s `properties.json` file with a label `preview`. This will hide the template from users, unless user uses query parameter `preview=true` in the URL.
Example `properties.json` file:
```json
{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Node.js&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Build and test a Node.js project with npm.&quot;,
    &quot;iconName&quot;: &quot;nodejs&quot;,
    &quot;categories&quot;: [&quot;Continuous integration&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;npm&quot;, &quot;React&quot;, &quot;Angular&quot;, &quot;Vue&quot;],
    &quot;labels&quot;: [&quot;preview&quot;]
}
```

For viewing the templates with `preview` label, provide query parameter `preview=true` to the  `new workflow` page URL. Eg. `https://github.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;/actions/new?preview=true`.

### Enable template for public
Remove the `labels` array from `properties.json` file to publish the template to public

    Auth.js is a set of open-source packages that are built on standard Web APIs for authentication in modern applications with any framework on any platform in any JS runtime.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Auth js is now part of [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/blog/authjs-joins-better-auth). We recommend new projects to start with Better Auth unless there are some very specific feature gaps (most notably stateless session management without a database).

## Features

### Flexible and easy to use

- Designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports 2.0+, OIDC
- Built-in support for [many popular sign-in services](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/packages/core/src/providers)
- Email/Passwordless authentication
- Passkeys/WebAuthn support
- Bring Your Database - or none! - stateless authentication with any backend (Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)
- Runtime-agnostic, runs anywhere! (Docker, Node.js, Serverless, etc.)

### Own your data

Auth.js can be used with or without a database.

- An open-source solution that allows you to keep control of your data
- Built-in support for [MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, SQLite, GraphQL, etc.](https://adapters.authjs.dev)
- Works great with databases from popular hosting providers

### Secure by default

- Promotes the use of passwordless sign-in mechanisms
- Designed to be secure by default and encourage best practices for safeguarding user data
- Uses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens on POST routes (sign in, sign out)
- Default cookie policy aims for the most restrictive policy appropriate for each cookie
- When JSON Web Tokens are used, they are encrypted by default (JWE) with A256CBC-HS512
- Features tab/window syncing and session polling to support short-lived sessions
- Attempts to implement the latest guidance published by [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org)

Advanced configuration allows you to define your routines to handle controlling what accounts are allowed to sign in, for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens and to set custom cookie security policies and session properties, so you can control who can sign in and how often sessions have to be re-validated.

### TypeScript

Auth.js libraries are written with type safety in mind. [Check out the docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/typescript) for more information.

## Security

If you think you have found a vulnerability (or are not sure) in Auth.js or any of the related packages (i.e. Adapters), we ask you to read our [Security Policy](https://authjs.dev/security) to reach out responsibly. Please do not open Pull Requests/Issues/Discussions before consulting with us.

## What is Herb?

**Herb** is an ecosystem of developer tooling built specifically around **HTML+ERB** (`.html.erb`) files. It is designed to simplify and enhance the experience of working with HTML+ERB templates through precise, accurate tooling.

At the core of Herb is the **Herb Parser**, a fast, portable, and HTML-aware ERB parser written in C. The parser generates a detailed, accurate syntax tree that serves as the foundation for reliable code analysis, transformations, and developer tooling.

The Herb ecosystem includes **developer tools** (CLI, language server, formatter, linter), **language bindings** (for Ruby, Node.js, and the Browser using WebAssembly), and **utility libraries** (language service, highlighter, minifier, printer). All these components leverage the Herb Parser&#039;s syntax tree to provide consistent, accurate, and helpful tooling experiences.

## What Herb Can Do for You

Herb provides a complete ecosystem of HTML+ERB tooling, designed to simplify and enhance your daily workflow. Built on the **Herb Parser**, it offers multiple tools that integrate seamlessly into editors, developer environments, and CI pipelines:

- **Herb Language Server** ([available now](https://herb-tools.dev/projects/language-server)):
  Rich integration for editors like VS Code, Zed, Neovim, and more. It provides diagnostics and real-time feedback to keep your templates error-free.

- **Herb Formatter** ([experimental preview](https://herb-tools.dev/projects/formatter)):
  Automatic, consistent formatting for HTML+ERB files, reducing manual styling and enforcing a standard across projects. Currently in experimental preview - use with caution on version-controlled files.

- **Herb Linter** ([available now](https://herb-tools.dev/projects/linter)):  
  Static analysis for your HTML+ERB templates to enforce best practices and quickly identify common mistakes with plenty of rules.

You can use Herb programmatically in **Ruby**, as well as in **JavaScript** via Node.js, WebAssembly, or directly in browsers.

For a complete overview of all available tools, libraries, and integrations, visit the [**Projects page**](https://herb-tools.dev/projects) on our documentation site.

## Motivation

HTML+ERB templates never really had good, accurate, and reliable tooling. While developer tooling for Ruby code improved significantly in the last few years (especially with the introduction of the new Prism parser), HTML+ERB files remained underserved, lacking fundamental support like syntax checking, auto-formatting, linting, and structural understanding.

At the same time, with the rise of tools like [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev), [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev), [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev), [HTMX](https://htmx.org), [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com), and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), advanced HTML templating became increasingly relevant (again). Developers expect modern, reliable, and precise tooling, especially given the robust ecosystem available to JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

Herb was built to close this tooling gap, providing proper tooling for HTML+ERB that matches what modern developers expect in the age of language servers, LLMs, and AI-driven workflows.

## Command-Line Usage

Install the Herb gem via RubyGems:

```sh
gem install herb
```

Basic usage to analyze all HTML+ERB files in your project:

```sh
herb analyze .
```

This will give you an overview of how the Herb Parser sees your project:
```
--- SUMMARY --------------------------------------------------------------------
Total files: 145
✅ Successful: 143 (98.6%)
❌ Failed: 0 (0.0%)
⚠️ Parse errors: 2 (1.4%)
⏱️ Timed out: 0 (0.0%)

Files with parse errors:
  - app/views/contributions/index.html.erb
  - index.html.erb

Results saved to 2025-06-29_12-16-23_erb_parsing_result_rubyevents.log
```

Herb also comes with other useful commands:

```
Herb 🌿 Powerful and seamless HTML-aware ERB parsing and tooling.

Usage:
  bundle exec herb [command] [options]

Commands:
  bundle exec herb lex [file]         Lex a file.
  bundle exec herb parse [file]       Parse a file.
  bundle exec herb analyze [path]     Analyze a project by passing a directory to the root of the project
  bundle exec herb ruby [file]        Extract Ruby from a file.
  bundle exec herb html [file]        Extract HTML from a file.
  bundle exec herb playground [file]  Open the content of the source file in the playground
  bundle exec herb version            Prints the versions of the Herb gem and the libherb library.
```

For detailed information, like how you can use Herb programatically in Ruby and JavaScript, visit the [documentation site](https://herb-tools.dev/bindings/ruby/reference).


## Background and Talk

**Herb** was first introduced at [**RubyKaigi 2025**](https://rubykaigi.org/2025/presentations/marcoroth.html) in April 2025 with the talk [*Empowering Developers with HTML-Aware ERB Tooling*](https://www.rubyevents.org/talks/empowering-developers-with-html-aware-erb-tooling-rubykaigi-2025).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb). Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for guidelines on how to set up Herb for local development and how to contribute to **Herb**.

## Prior Art &amp; Inspiration

While Herb brings a fresh approach to HTML+ERB tooling, it builds upon and learns from several existing tools and approaches in the ecosystem:

- [**Tree-sitter**](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)
- [**tree-sitter-embedded-template**](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-embedded-template)
- [**Prism Ruby Parser**](https://github.com/ruby/prism)
- [**Ruby LSP**](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp)
- [**better-html**](https://github.com/Shopify/better-html)
- [**erb_lint**](https://github.com/Shopify/erb_lint)
- [**erb-formatter**](https://github.com/nebulab/erb-formatter)
- [**erb-formatter-vscode**](https://github.com/nebulab/erb-formatter-vscode)
- [**deface**](https://github.com/spree/deface)
- [**html_press**](https://github.com/stereobooster/html_press)
- [**htmlbeautifier**](https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier)
- [**vscode-erb-beautify**](https://github.com/aliariff/vscode-erb-beautify)
- [**vscode-erb-linter**](https://github.com/manuelpuyol/vscode-erb-linter)
- [**syntax_tree-erb**](https://github.com/davidwessman/syntax_tree-erb)

Herb differentiates itself by being HTML-aware from the ground up, providing a unified parsing approach that understands both HTML and ERB as first-class citizens, rather than treating one as embedded within the other.
