## Run Locally / Self-Hosting

Suna can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. Follow these steps to set up your own instance.

### Requirements

You&#039;ll need the following components:
- A Supabase project for database and authentication
- Redis database for caching and session management
- Daytona sandbox for secure agent execution
- Python 3.11 for the API backend
- API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI or Anthropic)
- (Optional but recommended) Tavily API key for enhanced search capabilities

### Prerequisites

1. **Supabase**: 
   - Create a new [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
   - Save your project&#039;s API URL, anon key, and service role key for later use
   - Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)

2. **Redis**: Set up a Redis instance using one of these options:
   - [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) (recommended for cloud deployments)
   - Local installation:
     - [Mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/redis): `brew install redis`
     - [Linux](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/): Follow distribution-specific instructions
     - [Windows](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-windows/): Use WSL2 or Docker
   - Save your Redis connection details for later use

3. **Daytona**: 
   - Create an account on [Daytona](https://app.daytona.io/)
   - Generate an API key from your account settings
   - Go to [Images](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/images)
   - Click &quot;Add Image&quot;
   - Enter `adamcohenhillel/kortix-suna:0.0.20` as the image name
   - Set `/usr/bin/supervisord -n -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf` as the Entrypoint

4. **LLM API Keys**:
   - Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) or [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
   - While other providers should work via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), OpenAI and Anthropic are recommended

5. **Search API Key** (Optional):
   - For enhanced search capabilities, obtain an [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/)
  
6. **RapidAPI API Key** (Optional):
   - To enable API services like LinkedIn, and others, you&#039;ll need a RapidAPI key
   - Each service requires individual activation in your RapidAPI account:
     1. Locate the service&#039;s `base_url` in its corresponding file (e.g., `&quot;https://linkedin-data-scraper.p.rapidapi.com&quot;` in [`backend/agent/tools/data_providers/LinkedinProvider.py`](backend/agent/tools/data_providers/LinkedinProvider.py))
     2. Visit that specific API on the RapidAPI marketplace
     3. Subscribe to the service (many offer free tiers with limited requests)
     4. Once subscribed, the service will be available to your agent through the API Services tool

## Getting started

### Using Expo (recommended)

Expo is the fastest way to start developing. With the Expo framework, developers don&#039;t need to compile the native side of the application as before, hence no need for any native environment setup, developers only need to download a precompiled development build and run the javascript bundler. The development build will then connect with the bundler to load the javascript code.

#### Expo Environment Setup

[Install node, yarn and watchman.](./docs/readme/expo-environment.md)

#### Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MetaMask/metamask-mobile.git &amp;&amp; \
cd metamask-mobile
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn setup:expo
```

#### Run the bundler

```bash
yarn watch
```

#### Download and install the development build

#### For internal developers
- Access Runway via Okta and go to the Expo bucket either on the iOS or Android section. From there you will see the available development builds (android-expo-dev-build.apk or ios-expo-dev-build.ipa).
- For Android:
  - Install the .apk on your Android device or simulator.
- For iOS:
  - Device: you need to have your iPhone registered with our Apple dev account. If you have it, you can install the .ipa on your device.
  - Simulator: please follow the [native development section](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile?tab=readme-ov-file#native-development) and run `yarn setup` and `yarn start:ios` as the .ipa will not work for now, we are working on having an .app that works on simulators.

##### [SOON] For external developers (we are testing the new dev builds and will make them publicly available soon after)

#### Load the app

If on a simulator:
- use the initial expo screen that appears when starting the development to choose the bundler url
- OR press &quot;a&quot; for Android or &quot;i&quot; for iOS on the terminal where the bundler is running

If on a physical device:
- Use the camera app to scan the QR code presented by the bundler running on the terminal

That&#039;s it! This will work for any javascript development, if you need to develop or modify native code please see the next section.

### Native Development

If developing or modifying native code or installing any library that introduces or uses native code, it is not possible to use an Expo precompiled development build as you need to compile the native side of the application again. To do so, please follow the steps stated in this section.

#### Native Environment setup

Before running the app for native development, make sure your development environment has all the required tools. Several of these tools (ie Node and Ruby) may require specific versions in order to successfully build the app.

[Setup your development environment](./docs/readme/environment.md)

#### Building the app

**Clone the project**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MetaMask/metamask-mobile.git &amp;&amp; \
cd metamask-mobile
```

##### Firebase Messaging Setup

MetaMask uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to enable app communications. To integrate FCM, you&#039;ll need configuration files for both iOS and Android platforms.

###### Internal Contributor instructions

1. Grab the `.js.env` file from 1Password, ask around for the correct vault. This file contains the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID` and `GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS` secrets that will be used to generate the relevant configuration files for IOS/Android.
2. [Install](./README.md#install-dependencies) and [run &amp; start](./README.md#running-the-app) the application as documented below.

###### External Contributor instructions

As an external contributor, you need to provide your own Firebase project configuration files:
- **`GoogleService-Info.plist`** (iOS)
- **`google-services.json`** (Android)

1.	Create a Free Firebase Project
    - Set up a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    - Configure the project with a client package name matching `io.metamask` (IMPORTANT). 
2.	Add Configuration Files
    - Create/Update the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files in:
    - `android/app/google-services.json` (for Android)
    - `ios/GoogleServices/GoogleService-Info.plist` directory (for iOS)
3. Create the correct base64 environments variables.
  
```bash
# Generate Android Base64 Version of Google Services
export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID=&quot;$(base64 -w0 -i ./android/app/google-services.json)&quot; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID=\&quot;$GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID\&quot;&quot; | tee -a .js.env

# Generate IOS Base64 Version of Google Services
export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS=&quot;$(base64 -w0 -i ./ios/GoogleServices/GoogleService-Info.plist)&quot; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS=\&quot;$GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS\&quot;&quot; | tee -a .js.env
```

[!CAUTION]
&gt; In case you don&#039;t provide your own Firebase project config file or run the steps above, you will face the error `No matching client found for package name &#039;io.metamask&#039;`.

In case of any doubt, please follow the instructions in the link below to get your Firebase project config file.
[Firebase Project Quickstart](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/quickstart-js/messaging/readme/#getting_started)

##### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn setup
```

_Not the usual install command, this will run scripts and a lengthy postinstall flow_

#### Running the app for native development

**Run Metro bundler**

```bash
yarn watch
```

_Like a local server for the app_

**Run on a iOS device**

```bash
yarn start:ios
```

**Run on an Android device**

```bash
yarn start:android
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Tiptap Editor
The Tiptap Editor is a headless, framework-agnostic rich text editor that&#039;s customizable and extendable through extensions. Its headless nature means it comes without a set user interface, offering full design freedom (for a jumpstart, see linked [UI templates](#examples-codesandbox-and-ui-templates) below). Tiptap is based on the highly reliable [ProseMirror](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror) library.

Tiptap Editor is complemented by the collaboration open-source backend [Hocuspocus](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus). Both the Editor and Hocuspocus form the foundation of the [Tiptap Suite](https://tiptap.dev/).

### How does the Tiptap Editor work?

- **Headless Framework:** Tiptap does not rely on a user interface. So there is no need for class overrides or code hacks. If you do need an example UI feel free to browse our [UI templates](#examples-codesandbox-and-ui-templates) linked below.
- **Framework-agnostic:** The Tiptap Editor is designed to work across different frontend frameworks. This means whether you&#039;re using Vue, React, or plain JavaScript, Tiptap integrates  without compatibility issues.
- **Extension based:** Extensions in Tiptap allow for a tailored editing experience, from simple text styling to advanced features like drag-and-drop block editing. You have the option to choose from over 100 extensions available in the [documentation](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions) and [community](https://github.com/ueberdosis/awesome-tiptap/#community-extensions) to enhance your editor&#039;s functionality.
- **Customize your UX:** The editor was built to give you control to define your own [extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/guide/custom-extensions) and [nodes](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/nodes).


### Editor Pro Extensions
The **Pro Extensions** are a set of advanced functionalities that enhance the capabilities of the Tiptap Editor. They are additional features that can be integrated into the base editor to provide more sophisticated editing options.

Key functionalities include collaborative editing, which allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously, drag-and-drop file management for easier handling of documents and media, and unique node ID assignment. Review the docs right [here](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions).

Pro Extensions are free with a [Tiptap account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/pro-extensions). Once signed up, review the guide in your account.

### Make your editor collaborative
Interested in collaborative editing? Check out our open-source package [Hocuspocus](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus) - a collaboration backend built around the CRDT power of [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs). Hocuspocus serves as the backbone for the [Tiptap Suite](https://tiptap.dev/).

## Getting Started

Use the [cloud version](https://app.chartdb.io?ref=github_readme_2) or deploy locally:

### How To Use

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Or like this if you want to have AI capabilities:

```bash
npm install
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY&gt; npm run build
```

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY&gt; -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/chartdb/chartdb:latest
```

#### Build and Run locally

```bash
docker build -t chartdb .
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY&gt; -p 8080:80 chartdb
```

#### Using Custom Inference Server

```bash
# Build
docker build \
  --build-arg VITE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=&lt;YOUR_ENDPOINT&gt; \
  --build-arg VITE_LLM_MODEL_NAME=&lt;YOUR_MODEL_NAME&gt; \
  -t chartdb .

# Run
docker run \
  -e OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=&lt;YOUR_ENDPOINT&gt; \
  -e LLM_MODEL_NAME=&lt;YOUR_MODEL_NAME&gt; \
  -p 8080:80 chartdb
```

&gt; **Note:** You must configure either Option 1 (OpenAI API key) OR Option 2 (Custom endpoint and model name) for AI capabilities to work. Do not mix the two options.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

Example configuration for a local vLLM server:

```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/v1
VITE_LLM_MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ
```

1. Unique [BISHENG Workflow](https://dataelem.feishu.cn/wiki/R7HZwH5ZGiJUDrkHZXicA9pInif)
   - 🧩 **Independent and comprehensive application orchestration framework**: Enables the execution of various tasks within a single framework (while similar products rely on bot invocation or separate chatflow and workflow modules for different tasks).
   - 🔄 **Human in the loop**: Allows users to intervene and provide feedback during the execution of workflows (including multi-turn conversations), whereas similar products can only execute workflows from start to finish without intervention.
   - 💥 **Powerful**: Supports loops, parallelism, batch processing, conditional logic, and free combination of all logic components. It also handles complex scenarios such as multi-type input/output, report generation, content review, and more.
   - 🖐️ **User-friendly and intuitive**: Operations like loops, parallelism, and batch processing, which require specialized components in similar products, can be easily visualized in BISHENG as a &quot;flowchart&quot; (drawing a loop forms a loop, aligning elements creates parallelism, and selecting multiple items enables batch processing).

2. &lt;b&gt;Designed for Enterprise Applications&lt;/b&gt;: Document review, fixed-layout report generation, multi-agent collaboration, policy update comparison, support ticket assistance, customer service assistance, meeting minutes generation, resume screening, call record analysis, unstructured data governance, knowledge mining, data analysis, and more. 

​	The platform supports the construction of &lt;b&gt;highly complex enterprise application scenarios&lt;/b&gt; and offers &lt;b&gt;deep optimization&lt;/b&gt; 	with hundreds of components and thousands of parameters.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Legend List

**Legend List** is a high-performance list component for **React Native**, written purely in Typescript with no native dependencies. It is a drop-in replacement for `FlatList` and `FlashList` with better performance, especially when handling dynamically sized items.

&lt;video src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8641e305-ab06-4fb3-a96a-fd220df84985&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

## 🤔 Why Legend List?

*   **Performance:** Designed from the ground up and heavily optimized for performance, it is faster than FlatList and other list libraries in most scenarios.
*   **Dynamic Item Sizes:** Natively supports items with varying heights without performance hits.
*   **Drop-in Replacement:** API compatibility with `FlatList` and `FlashList` for easier migration.
*   **100% JS:** No native module linking required, ensuring easy integration and compatibility across platforms.
*   **Lightweight:** Our goal is to keep LegendList as small of a dependency as possible. For more advanced use cases, we plan on supporting optional plugins. This ensures that we keep the package size as small as possible.
*   **Bidirectional infinite lists:** Supports infinite scrolling in both directions with no flashes or scroll jumping
*   **Chat UIs without inverted:** Chat UIs can align their content to the bottom and maintain scroll at end, so that the list doesn&#039;t need to be inverted, which causes weird behavior (in animations, etc...)

For more information, listen to the Legend List episode of the [React Native Radio Podcast](https://infinite.red/react-native-radio/rnr-325-legend-list-with-jay-meistrich) and the [livestream with Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpZMveUCke8).

## ✨ Additional Features

Beyond standard `FlatList` capabilities:

*   `recycleItems`: (boolean) Toggles item component recycling.
    *   `true`: Reuses item components for optimal performance. Be cautious if your item components contain local state, as it might be reused unexpectedly.
    *   `false` (default): Creates new item components every time. Less performant but safer if items have complex internal state.
*   `maintainScrollAtEnd`: (boolean) If `true` and the user is scrolled near the bottom (within `maintainScrollAtEndThreshold * screen height`), the list automatically scrolls to the end when items are added or heights change. Useful for chat interfaces.
*   `alignItemsAtEnd`: (boolean) Useful for chat UIs, content smaller than the View will be aligned to the bottom of the list.

Langfuse is an **open source LLM engineering** platform. It helps teams collaboratively
**develop, monitor, evaluate,** and **debug** AI applications. Langfuse can be **self-hosted in minutes** and is **battle-tested**.

[![Langfuse Overview Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3926b288-ff61-4b95-8aa1-45d041c70866)](https://langfuse.com/watch-demo)

## ✨ Core Features

![Langfuse Overview](https://langfuse.com/images/docs/github-readme/github-feature-overview.png)

- [LLM Application Observability](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing): Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions. Try the interactive [demo](https://langfuse.com/docs/demo) to see this in action.

- [Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started) helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts. Thanks to strong caching on server and client side, you can iterate on prompts without adding latency to your application.

- [Evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview) are key to the LLM application development workflow, and Langfuse adapts to your needs. It supports LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback collection, manual labeling, and custom evaluation pipelines via APIs/SDKs.

- [Datasets](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/overview) enable test sets and benchmarks for evaluating your LLM application. They support continuous improvement, pre-deployment testing, structured experiments, flexible evaluation, and seamless integration with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.

- [LLM Playground](https://langfuse.com/docs/playground) is a tool for testing and iterating on your prompts and model configurations, shortening the feedback loop and accelerating development. When you see a bad result in tracing, you can directly jump to the playground to iterate on it.

- [Comprehensive API](https://langfuse.com/docs/api): Langfuse is frequently used to power bespoke LLMOps workflows while using the building blocks provided by Langfuse via the API. OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, and typed SDKs for Python, JS/TS are available.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions.

### 1️⃣ Create new project

1.  [Create Langfuse account](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up) or [self-host](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting)
2.  Create a new project
3.  Create new API credentials in the project settings

### 2️⃣ Log your first LLM call

The [`@observe()` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators) makes it easy to trace any Python LLM application. In this quickstart we also use the Langfuse [OpenAI integration](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai) to automatically capture all model parameters.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Not using OpenAI? Visit [our documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started#log-your-first-llm-call-to-langfuse) to learn how to log other models and frameworks.

```bash
pip install langfuse openai
```

```bash filename=&quot;.env&quot;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Browserbase MCP Server

![cover](assets/cover-mcp.png)

[The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you’re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

This server provides cloud browser automation capabilities using [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), and [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages, take screenshots, and execute JavaScript in a cloud browser environment.

To learn to get started with Browserbase, check out [Browserbase MCP](./browserbase/README.md) or [Stagehand MCP](./stagehand/README.md).

# What Tabby is and isn&#039;t

* **Tabby is** an alternative to Windows&#039; standard terminal (conhost), PowerShell ISE, PuTTY, macOS Terminal.app and iTerm

* **Tabby is not** a new shell or a MinGW or Cygwin replacement. Neither is it lightweight - if RAM usage is of importance, consider [Conemu](https://conemu.github.io) or [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)

&lt;a name=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

# Terminal features

![](docs/readme-terminal.png)

* A VT220 terminal + various extensions
* Multiple nested split panes
* Tabs on any side of the window
* Optional dockable window with a global spawn hotkey (&quot;Quake console&quot;)
* Progress detection
* Notification on process completion
* Bracketed paste, multiline paste warnings
* Font ligatures
* Custom shell profiles
* Optional RMB paste and copy-on select (PuTTY style)

&lt;a name=&quot;ssh&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

# SSH Client

![](docs/readme-ssh.png)

* SSH2 client with a connection manager
* X11 and port forwarding
* Automatic jump host management
* Agent forwarding (incl. Pageant and Windows native OpenSSH Agent)
* Login scripts

&lt;a name=&quot;serial&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

# Serial Terminal

* Saved connections
* Readline input support
* Optional hex byte-by-byte input and hexdump output
* Newline conversion
* Automatic reconnection

&lt;a name=&quot;portable&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

# Portable

Tabby will run as a portable app on Windows, if you create a `data` folder in the same location where `Tabby.exe` lives.

## 💡 What is RAGFlow?

[RAGFlow](https://ragflow.io/) is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine based on deep document
understanding. It offers a streamlined RAG workflow for businesses of any scale, combining LLM (Large Language Models)
to provide truthful question-answering capabilities, backed by well-founded citations from various complex formatted
data.

## 🔎 System Architecture

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/assets/12318111/d6ac5664-c237-4200-a7c2-a4a00691b485&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## 🎬 Get Started

### 📝 Prerequisites

- CPU &gt;= 4 cores
- RAM &gt;= 16 GB
- Disk &gt;= 50 GB
- Docker &gt;= 24.0.0 &amp; Docker Compose &gt;= v2.26.1
  &gt; If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux),
  &gt; see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 🚀 Start up the server

1. Ensure `vm.max_map_count` &gt;= 262144:

   &gt; To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; $ sysctl vm.max_map_count
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; # In this case, we set it to 262144:
   &gt; $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the
   &gt; `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```

2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   ```

3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don&#039;t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.
&gt; If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.

   &gt; The command below downloads the `v0.18.0-slim` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.18.0-slim`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server. For example: set `RAGFLOW_IMAGE=infiniflow/ragflow:v0.18.0` for the full edition `v0.18.0`.

   ```bash
   $ cd ragflow/docker
   # Use CPU for embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

   # To use GPU to accelerate embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   # docker compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up -d
   ```

   | RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?                  |
   |-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
   | v0.18.0           | &amp;approx;9       | :heavy_check_mark:    | Stable release           |
   | v0.18.0-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                   | Stable release            |
   | nightly           | &amp;approx;9       | :heavy_check_mark:    | _Unstable_ nightly build |
   | nightly-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                   | _Unstable_ nightly build  |

4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:

   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f ragflow-server
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ```bash

         ____   ___    ______ ______ __
        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __
       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /
      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /
     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/

    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
   ```

   &gt; If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network anormal`
   &gt; error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.

5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.
   &gt; With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default
   &gt; HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.
6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update
   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.

   &gt; See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.

   _The show is on!_

## 🔧 Configurations

When it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:

- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and
  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.
- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.

&gt; The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service
&gt; configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.

To update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`
to `&lt;YOUR_SERVING_PORT&gt;:80`.

Updates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:

&gt; ```bash
&gt; $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
&gt; ```

### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity

RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:

1. Stop all running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.

2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.

3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.

## 🔧 Build a Docker image without embedding models

This image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg LIGHTEN=1 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly-slim .
```

## 🔧 Build a Docker image including embedding models

This image is approximately 9 GB in size. As it includes embedding models, it relies on external LLM services only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

## 🔨 Launch service from source for development

1. Install uv, or skip this step if it is already installed:

   ```bash
   pipx install uv pre-commit
   ```

2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   cd ragflow/
   uv sync --python 3.10 --all-extras # install RAGFlow dependent python modules
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d
   ```

   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:

   ```
   127.0.0.1       es01 infinity mysql minio redis
   ```

4. If you cannot access HuggingFace, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to use a mirror site:

   ```bash
   export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   ```

5. Launch backend service:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
   bash docker/launch_backend_service.sh
   ```

6. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```
7. Launch frontend service:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_
