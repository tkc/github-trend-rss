## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it&#039;s an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Preview

![video-preview](.assets/perplexica-preview.gif)

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can utilize local LLMs such as Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, and Mistral.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user&#039;s query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
- **API**: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI&#039;s models**.
   - `CUSTOM_OPENAI`: Your OpenAI-API-compliant local server URL, model name, and API key. You should run your local server with host set to `0.0.0.0`, take note of which port number it is running on, and then use that port number to set `API_URL = http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. You must specify the model name, such as `MODEL_NAME = &quot;unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_XL&quot;`. Finally, set `API_KEY` to the appropriate value. If you have not defined an API key, just put anything you want in-between the quotation marks: `API_KEY = &quot;whatever-you-want-but-not-blank&quot;` **You only need to configure these settings if you want to use a local OpenAI-compliant server, such as Llama.cpp&#039;s [`llama-server`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md)**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama&#039;s models instead of OpenAI&#039;s**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq&#039;s hosted models**.
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your Anthropic API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models**.
   - `Gemini`: Your Gemini API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Google&#039;s models**.
   - `DEEPSEEK`: Your Deepseek API key. **Only needed if you want Deepseek models.**
   - `AIMLAPI`: Your AI/ML API key. **Only needed if you want to use AI/ML API models and embeddings.**

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. After populating the configuration run `npm i`.
4. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build`.
5. Finally, start the app by running `npm run start`

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Troubleshooting

#### Local OpenAI-API-Compliant Servers

If Perplexica tells you that you haven&#039;t configured any chat model providers, ensure that:

1. Your server is running on `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) and on the same port you put in the API URL.
2. You have specified the correct model name loaded by your local LLM server.
3. You have specified the correct API key, or if one is not defined, you have put *something* in the API key field and not left it empty.

#### Ollama Connection Errors

If you&#039;re encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama&#039;s API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://&lt;private_ip_of_host&gt;:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you&#039;re using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment=&quot;OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434&quot;`. (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with `systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser&#039;s search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser&#039;s settings.
2. Navigate to the &#039;Search Engines&#039; section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser&#039;s search bar.

## Using Perplexica&#039;s API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.

## How does it work?

Genkit simplifies AI integration with an open-source SDK and unified APIs that
work across various model providers and programming languages. It abstracts away complexity so you can focus on delivering great user experiences.

Some key features offered by Genkit include:

* [Text and image generation](https://genkit.dev/docs/models)
* [Type-safe, structured data generation](https://genkit.dev/docs/models#structured-output)
* [Tool calling](https://genkit.dev/docs/tool-calling)
* [Prompt templating](https://genkit.dev/docs/dotprompt)
* [Persisted chat interfaces](https://genkit.dev/docs/chat)
* [AI workflows](https://genkit.dev/docs/flows)
* [AI-powered data retrieval (RAG)](https://genkit.dev/docs/rag)

Genkit is designed for server-side deployment in multiple language environments, and also provides seamless client-side integration through dedicated helpers and [client SDKs](https://genkit.dev/docs/firebase).

## Implementation path

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Choose your language and model provider&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Select the Genkit SDK for your preferred language (JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, or Python (Alpha)). Choose a model provider like &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/plugins/google-genai&quot;&gt;Google Gemini&lt;/a&gt; or Anthropic, and get an API key. Some providers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/plugins/vertex-ai&quot;&gt;Vertex AI&lt;/a&gt;, may rely on a different means of authentication.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Install the SDK and initialize&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Install the Genkit SDK, model-provider package of your choice, and the Genkit CLI. Import the Genkit and provider packages and initialize Genkit with the provider API key.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Write and test AI features&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Use the Genkit SDK to build AI features for your use case, from basic text generation to complex multi-step workflows and agents. Use the CLI and Developer UI to help you rapidly test and iterate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Deploy and monitor&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Deploy your AI features to Firebase, Google Cloud Run, or any environment that supports your chosen programming language. Integrate them into your app, and monitor them in production in the Firebase console.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

💡 **Windows Note**: If you encounter SQLite errors, Claude Flow will automatically use in-memory storage. For persistent storage options, see our [Windows guide](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow/blob/main/docs/windows-installation.md).

### 🎯 **Instant Alpha Testing**

```bash
# 1. Initialize Claude Flow with enhanced MCP setup (auto-configures permissions!)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force

# 2. Explore all revolutionary capabilities  
npx claude-flow@alpha --help

# 3a. Quick AI coordination (recommended for most tasks)
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;build me a REST API&quot; --claude

# 3b. OR launch the full hive-mind system (for complex projects)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;build enterprise system&quot; --claude
```

### 🚀 **Quick Start with Flow Nexus**

```bash
# 1. Initialize Flow Nexus only (minimal setup)
npx claude-flow init --flow-nexus

# 2. Register and login (use MCP tools in Claude Code)
mcp__flow-nexus__user_register({ email: &quot;your@email.com&quot;, password: &quot;secure&quot; })
mcp__flow-nexus__user_login({ email: &quot;your@email.com&quot;, password: &quot;secure&quot; })

# 3. Deploy your first cloud swarm
mcp__flow-nexus__swarm_init({ topology: &quot;mesh&quot;, maxAgents: 5 })
mcp__flow-nexus__sandbox_create({ template: &quot;node&quot;, name: &quot;api-dev&quot; })
```

### 🤔 **Swarm vs Hive-Mind: Which to Use?**

| Feature | `swarm` Command | `hive-mind` Command |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Best For** | Quick tasks, single objectives | Complex projects, persistent sessions |
| **Setup** | Instant - no configuration needed | Interactive wizard setup |
| **Session** | Temporary coordination | Persistent with resume capability |
| **Memory** | Task-scoped | Project-wide with SQLite storage |
| **Agents** | Auto-spawned for task | Manual control with specializations |
| **Use When** | &quot;Build X&quot;, &quot;Fix Y&quot;, &quot;Analyze Z&quot; | Multi-feature projects, team coordination |

**Quick Rule:** Start with `swarm` for most tasks. Use `hive-mind` when you need persistent sessions or complex multi-agent coordination.

## 🎯 **Typical Workflows - Your &quot;Happy Path&quot; Guide**

### **New to Claude-Flow? Start Here!**

Confused about `.hive-mind` and `.swarm` directories? Not sure when to create new hives? Here are the most common workflow patterns:

#### **🚀 Pattern 1: Single Feature Development**
```bash
# Initialize once per feature/task
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;Implement user authentication&quot; --claude

# Continue working on SAME feature (reuse existing hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query &quot;authentication&quot; --recent
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;Add password reset functionality&quot; --continue-session
```

#### **🏗️ Pattern 2: Multi-Feature Project**
```bash
# Project-level initialization (once per project)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force --project-name &quot;my-app&quot;

# Feature 1: Authentication (new hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;auth-system&quot; --namespace auth --claude

# Feature 2: User management (separate hive)  
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;user-management&quot; --namespace users --claude

# Resume Feature 1 later (use session ID from spawn output)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-xxxxx-xxxxx
```

#### **🔍 Pattern 3: Research &amp; Analysis**
```bash
# Start research session
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;Research microservices patterns&quot; --agents researcher,analyst --claude

# Continue research in SAME session
npx claude-flow@alpha memory stats  # See what&#039;s been learned
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;Deep dive into API gateway patterns&quot; --continue-session
```

### **🤔 When Should I Create a New Hive?**

| Situation | Action | Command |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Same objective/feature** | Continue existing hive | `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume &lt;session-id&gt;` |
| **New feature in same project** | Create new hive with namespace | `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;new-feature&quot; --namespace feature-name` |
| **Completely different project** | New directory + init | `mkdir new-project &amp;&amp; cd new-project &amp;&amp; npx claude-flow@alpha init` |
| **Experimenting/testing** | Temporary hive | `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;experiment&quot; --temp` |

### **📁 Understanding &quot;Empty&quot; Directories**

**Don&#039;t panic if directories seem empty!** Claude-Flow uses SQLite databases that may not show files in directory listings:

```bash
# Check what&#039;s actually stored (even if directories look empty)
npx claude-flow@alpha memory stats        # See memory data
npx claude-flow@alpha memory list         # List all namespaces  
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status    # See active hives

# Your project structure after initialization:
# .hive-mind/     &lt;- Contains config.json + SQLite session data
# .swarm/         &lt;- Contains memory.db (SQLite database)
# memory/         &lt;- Agent-specific memories (created when agents spawn)
# coordination/   &lt;- Active workflow files (created during tasks)
```

### **🔄 Continuing Previous Work**

```bash
# See what you were working on
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query --recent --limit 5

# List all sessions to find the one you want
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind sessions

# Resume specific session by ID
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-xxxxx-xxxxx
```

---

## 🪝 **Advanced Hooks System**

### **Automated Workflow Enhancement**
Claude-Flow v2.0.0 introduces a powerful hooks system that automates coordination and enhances every operation:

```bash
# Hooks automatically trigger on operations
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force  # Auto-configures MCP servers &amp; hooks
```

### **Available Hooks**

#### **Pre-Operation Hooks**
- **`pre-task`**: Auto-assigns agents based on task complexity
- **`pre-search`**: Caches searches for improved performance  
- **`pre-edit`**: Validates files and prepares resources
- **`pre-command`**: Security validation before execution

#### **Post-Operation Hooks**
- **`post-edit`**: Auto-formats code using language-specific tools
- **`post-task`**: Trains neural patterns from successful operations
- **`post-command`**: Updates memory with operation context
- **`notification`**: Real-time progress updates

#### **Session Hooks**
- **`session-start`**: Restores previous context automatically
- **`session-end`**: Generates summaries and persists state
- **`session-restore`**: Loads memory from previous sessions

### **Hook Configuration**
```json
// .claude/settings.json (auto-configured)
{
  &quot;hooks&quot;: {
    &quot;preEditHook&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;claude-flow&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, &quot;pre-edit&quot;, &quot;--file&quot;, &quot;${file}&quot;, &quot;--auto-assign-agents&quot;, &quot;true&quot;],
      &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: false
    },
    &quot;postEditHook&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;, 
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;claude-flow&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, &quot;post-edit&quot;, &quot;--file&quot;, &quot;${file}&quot;, &quot;--format&quot;, &quot;true&quot;],
      &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: true
    },
    &quot;sessionEndHook&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;claude-flow&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, &quot;session-end&quot;, &quot;--generate-summary&quot;, &quot;true&quot;],
      &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### **Using Hooks in Claude Code**

Hooks integrate seamlessly with Claude Code&#039;s workflow:

1. **Automatic Triggering**: Hooks fire automatically during Claude Code operations
2. **Context Awareness**: Each hook receives relevant context (file paths, commands, etc.)
3. **Non-Blocking**: Hooks run asynchronously to maintain performance
4. **Configurable**: Enable/disable specific hooks as needed

### **Hook Examples**

```bash
# Manual hook execution
npx claude-flow hooks pre-task --description &quot;Build REST API&quot; --auto-spawn-agents

# Post-edit with formatting
npx claude-flow hooks post-edit --file &quot;src/api.js&quot; --format --train-neural

# Session management
npx claude-flow hooks session-end --generate-summary --persist-state
```

### **Fixing Hook Variable Interpolation**

If you&#039;re experiencing issues with `${file}` or `${command}` variables not working in your hooks (common with Claude Code 1.0.51+), use the `fix-hook-variables` command:

```bash
# Fix all found settings.json files
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables

# Fix specific file
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables .claude/settings.json

# Create test configuration
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables --test
```

This command automatically transforms legacy variable syntax to working environment variables:
- `${file}` → `$CLAUDE_EDITED_FILE`
- `${command}` → `$CLAUDE_COMMAND`
- `${tool}` → `$CLAUDE_TOOL`

# 🔥 Firecrawl

Empower your AI apps with clean data from any website. Featuring advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities.

_This repository is in development, and we’re still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It&#039;s not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

## How to use it?

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### Features

- [**Scrape**](#scraping): scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via [LLM Extract](#llm-extraction-beta), screenshot, html)
- [**Crawl**](#crawling): scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- [**Map**](#map): input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
- [**Search**](#search): search the web and get full content from results
- [**Extract**](#extract): get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.

### Powerful Capabilities
- **LLM-ready formats**: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
- **The hard stuff**: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- **Customizability**: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc...
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
- **Batching**: scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint
- **Change Tracking**: monitor and detect changes in website content over time

You can find all of Firecrawl&#039;s capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev)

### Search

Search the web and get full content from results

Firecrawl’s search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation.

- Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
- Search the web with customizable parameters (language, country, etc.)
- Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats
- Control the number of results and set timeouts

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;what is firecrawl?&quot;,
    &quot;limit&quot;: 5
  }&#039;
```

#### Response

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl | Home Page&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Turn websites into LLM-ready data with Firecrawl&quot;
    },

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Documentation | Firecrawl&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Learn how to use Firecrawl in your own applications&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

#### With content scraping

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;what is firecrawl?&quot;,
    &quot;limit&quot;: 5,
    &quot;scrapeOptions&quot;: {
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;links&quot;]
    }
  }&#039;
```

### Extract (Beta)

Get structured data from entire websites with a prompt and/or a schema.

You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards:

Single Page:
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/some-page

Multiple Pages / Full Domain
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/*

When you use /*, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/extract \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [
        &quot;https://firecrawl.dev/*&quot;, 
        &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;, 
        &quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/companies&quot;
      ],
      &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission, whether it is open source, and whether it is in Y Combinator from the page.&quot;,
      &quot;schema&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
        &quot;properties&quot;: {
          &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          }
        },
        &quot;required&quot;: [
          &quot;company_mission&quot;,
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
        ]
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;44aa536d-f1cb-4706-ab87-ed0386685740&quot;,
  &quot;urlTrace&quot;: []
}
```

If you are using the sdks, it will auto pull the response for you:

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl is the easiest way to extract data from the web. Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.&quot;,
    &quot;supports_sso&quot;: false,
    &quot;is_open_source&quot;: true,
    &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
  }
}
```

### LLM Extraction (Beta)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
  -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \

      &quot;is_open_source&quot;: false,
      &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Extracting without a schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;json&quot;,
          &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission from the page.&quot;
        }
      ]
    }&#039;
```

### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;google.com&quot;,
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
        &quot;actions&quot;: [
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;textarea[title=\&quot;Search\&quot;]&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;write&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;firecrawl&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;press&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;ENTER&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;h3&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;screenshot&quot;}
        ]
    }&#039;
```

### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/batch/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;, &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview&quot;],
      &quot;formats&quot; : [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
    }&#039;
```



## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl

firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key=&quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;)

# Scrape a website (returns a Document)
doc = firecrawl.scrape(
    &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    formats=[&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;],
)
print(doc.markdown)

# Crawl a website
response = firecrawl.crawl(
    &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    limit=100,
    scrape_options={&quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]},
    poll_interval=30,
)
print(response)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class Article(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticles(BaseModel):
    top: List[Article] = Field(..., description=&quot;Top 5 stories&quot;)

# Use JSON format with a Pydantic schema
doc = firecrawl.scrape(
    &quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;,
    formats=[{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;json&quot;, &quot;schema&quot;: TopArticles}],
)
print(doc.json)
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `Firecrawl` class.

```js
import Firecrawl from &#039;@mendable/firecrawl-js&#039;;

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: &#039;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&#039; });

// Scrape a website
const doc = await firecrawl.scrape(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {
  formats: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;],
});
console.log(doc);

// Crawl a website
const response = await firecrawl.crawl(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: { formats: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;] },
});
console.log(response);
```


### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:

```js
import Firecrawl from &#039;@mendable/firecrawl-js&#039;;
import { z } from &#039;zod&#039;;

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: &#039;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&#039; });

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

## Introduction

Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web. It includes a universal runtime and libraries that let you build native apps by writing React and JavaScript.

This repository includes the Expo SDK, Modules API, Go app, CLI, Router, documentation, and various other supporting tools. [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) is a platform of hosted services that are deeply integrated with Expo open source tools. EAS helps you build, ship, and iterate on your app as an individual or a team.

Read the [Expo Community Guidelines](https://expo.dev/guidelines) before interacting in the repository. Thank you for helping keep the Expo community open and welcoming!

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Codebuff

Codebuff is an **open-source AI coding assistant** that edits your codebase through natural language instructions. Instead of using one model for everything, it coordinates specialized agents that work together to understand your project and make precise changes.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/codebuff-vs-claude-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codebuff vs Claude Code&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Codebuff beats Claude Code at 61% vs 53% on [our evals](evals/README.md) across 175+ coding tasks over multiple open-source repos that simulate real-world tasks.

![Codebuff Demo](./assets/demo.gif)

## How it works

When you ask Codebuff to &quot;add authentication to my API,&quot; it might invoke:

1. A **File Explorer Agent** to scan your codebase to understand the architecture and find relevant files
2. A **Planner Agent** to plan which files need changes and in what order
3. An **Editor Agent** to make precise edits
4. A **Reviewer Agent** to validate changes

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/multi-agents.png&quot; alt=&quot;Codebuff Multi-Agents&quot; width=&quot;250&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This multi-agent approach gives you better context understanding, more accurate edits, and fewer errors compared to single-model tools.

## CLI: Install and start coding

Install:

```bash
npm install -g codebuff
```

Run:

```bash
cd your-project
codebuff
```

Then just tell Codebuff what you want and it handles the rest:

- &quot;Fix the SQL injection vulnerability in user registration&quot;
- &quot;Add rate limiting to all API endpoints&quot;
- &quot;Refactor the database connection code for better performance&quot;

Codebuff will find the right files, makes changes across your codebase, and runs tests to make sure nothing breaks.

## Create custom agents

To get started building your own agents, run:

```bash
codebuff init-agents
```

You can write agent definition files that give you maximum control over agent behavior.

Implement your workflows by specifying tools, which agents can be spawned, and prompts. We even have TypeScript generators for more programmatic control.

For example, here&#039;s a `git-committer` agent that creates git commits based on the current git state. Notice that it runs `git diff` and `git log` to analyze changes, but then hands control over to the LLM to craft a meaningful commit message and perform the actual commit.

```typescript
export default {
  id: &#039;git-committer&#039;,
  displayName: &#039;Git Committer&#039;,
  model: &#039;openai/gpt-5-nano&#039;,
  toolNames: [&#039;read_files&#039;, &#039;run_terminal_command&#039;, &#039;end_turn&#039;],

  instructionsPrompt:
    &#039;You create meaningful git commits by analyzing changes, reading relevant files for context, and crafting clear commit messages that explain the &quot;why&quot; behind changes.&#039;,

  async *handleSteps() {
    // Analyze what changed
    yield { tool: &#039;run_terminal_command&#039;, command: &#039;git diff&#039; }
    yield { tool: &#039;run_terminal_command&#039;, command: &#039;git log --oneline -5&#039; }

    // Stage files and create commit with good message
    yield &#039;STEP_ALL&#039;
  },
}
```

## SDK: Run agents in production

Install the [SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codebuff/sdk) -- note this is different than the CLI codebuff package.

```bash
npm install @codebuff/sdk
```

Import the client and run agents!

```typescript
import { CodebuffClient } from &#039;@codebuff/sdk&#039;

// 1. Initialize the client
const client = new CodebuffClient({
  apiKey: &#039;your-api-key&#039;,
  cwd: &#039;/path/to/your/project&#039;,
  onError: (error) =&gt; console.error(&#039;Codebuff error:&#039;, error.message),
})

// 2. Do a coding task...
const result = await client.run({
  agent: &#039;base&#039;, // Codebuff&#039;s base coding agent
  prompt: &#039;Add comprehensive error handling to all API endpoints&#039;,
  handleEvent: (event) =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;Progress&#039;, event)
  },
})

// 3. Or, run a custom agent!
const myCustomAgent: AgentDefinition = {
  id: &#039;greeter&#039;,
  displayName: &#039;Greeter&#039;,
  model: &#039;openai/gpt-5&#039;,
  instructionsPrompt: &#039;Say hello!&#039;,
}
await client.run({
  agent: &#039;greeter&#039;,
  agentDefinitions: [myCustomAgent],
  prompt: &#039;My name is Bob.&#039;,
  customToolDefinitions: [], // Add custom tools too!
  handleEvent: (event) =&gt; {
    console.log(&#039;Progress&#039;, event)
  },
})
```

## 🎯 What is Motia?

**Motia solves backend fragmentation.** 

Modern software engineering is disjointed – APIs live in one framework, background jobs in another, queues have their own tooling, and AI agents are springing up in yet more isolated runtimes. **This fragmentation demands a unified system.**

Motia unifies APIs, background jobs, workflows, and AI agents into a **single coherent system** with shared observability and developer experience. Similar to how React simplified frontend development, where everything is a component, **Motia simplifies backend development, where everything is a Step**.

Write **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more** in the same workflow. **What used to take 5 frameworks to build now comes out of the box with Motia.**

[![Motia combines APIs, background queues, and AI agents into one system](assets/github-readme-banner.gif)](https://motia.dev)

## FAQ

-   [Frequently Asked Questions](./doc/FAQ.md)

## Why I made Chatbox?

I developed Chatbox initially because I was debugging some prompts and found myself in need of a simple and easy-to-use prompt and API debugging tool. I thought there might be more people who needed such a tool, so I open-sourced it.

At first, I didn&#039;t know that it would be so popular. I listened to the feedback from the open-source community and continued to develop and improve it. Now, it has become a very useful AI desktop application. There are many users who love Chatbox, and they not only use it for developing and debugging prompts, but also for daily chatting, and even to do some more interesting things like using well-designed prompts to make AI play various professional roles to assist them in everyday work...

## ✨ What is Eliza?

Eliza is an all-in-one, extensible platform for building and deploying AI-powered applications. Whether you&#039;re creating sophisticated chatbots, autonomous agents for business process automation, or intelligent game NPCs, Eliza provides the tools you need to get started quickly and scale effectively.

It combines a modular architecture, a powerful CLI, and a rich web interface to give you full control over your agents&#039; development, deployment, and management lifecycle.

For complete guides and API references, visit our official **[documentation](https://docs.elizaos.ai/)**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔌 **Rich Connectivity**: Out-of-the-box connectors for Discord, Telegram, Farcaster, and more.
- 🧠 **Model Agnostic**: Supports all major models, including OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Llama, and Grok.
- 🖥️ **Modern Web UI**: A professional dashboard for managing agents, groups, and conversations in real-time.
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Designed from the ground up for creating and orchestrating groups of specialized agents.
- 📄 **Document Ingestion**: Easily ingest documents and allow agents to retrieve information and answer questions from your data (RAG).
- 🛠️ **Highly Extensible**: Build your own functionality with a powerful plugin system.
- 📦 **It Just Works**: A seamless setup and development experience from day one.

## 🏁 Getting Started (5-Minute Quick Start)

There are two recommended paths for using Eliza:

- **For Beginners &amp; Standalone Projects (CLI):** If you want to create and deploy agents without modifying Eliza&#039;s core code, the CLI is the fastest and simplest method. The guide below is for you.

- **For Power Users &amp; Contributors (Monorepo):** If you plan to contribute to Eliza, create complex custom plugins, or manage multiple projects in one place, we recommend cloning the full monorepo. See the [How to Contribute](#-how-to-contribute) section to get started.

Get your first AI agent running in just a few commands.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v23+)
- [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

&gt; **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
# Install the ElizaOS CLI globally
bun install -g @elizaos/cli

# Verify installation
elizaos --version
```

### 2. Create Your Project

```bash
# Create a new project with an interactive setup
elizaos create my-first-agent

# Follow the prompts. For beginners, we recommend:
# - Database: pglite (no setup required)
# - Model Provider: openai
# - Project Type: project
```

### 3. Configure Your API Key

```bash
cd my-first-agent

# Open the local environment file
elizaos env edit-local
```

Add your model provider&#039;s API key (e.g., for OpenAI):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Start Your Agent

```bash
# Build and start the agent server
elizaos start
```

Your agent is now running!
- **Web Interface**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api`

---

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;📚 **Advanced CLI Commands &amp; Usage**&lt;/summary&gt;

Eliza&#039;s CLI is powerful. Here are some more commands for development and management.

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes to your agent code, then rebuild and restart
bun run build
elizaos start

# Or, start in development mode with auto-rebuild
elizaos dev

# Run tests to verify your changes
elizaos test
```

#### Agent &amp; Environment Management
```bash
# List all available agents
elizaos agent list

# Start a specific agent by name
elizaos agent start --name &quot;MyAgent&quot;

# Show all environment variables
elizaos env list
```

#### Debugging
```bash
# Start with detailed debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start
```
For a full command reference, run `elizaos --help` or `elizaos &lt;command&gt; --help`.

&lt;/details&gt;

## Notification Workflows as Code
For API documentation and reference, please visit [Echo API Reference](https://docs.novu.co/echo/quickstart?utm_campaign=github-readme).

```ts

client.workflow(&#039;comment-on-post&#039;, async ({step, subscriber}) =&gt; {
  const inAppResponse = await step.inApp(&#039;in-app-step&#039;, async (inputs) =&gt; {
    return {
      body: renderReactComponent(inputs)
    };
  }, {
    inputSchema: {
      // ...JSON Schema or ZOD/Ajv/Class Validators definition
    }
  });

  // Novu Worker Engine will manage the state and durability of each step in isolation
  const { events } = await step.digest(&#039;1 day&#039;);

  await step.email(&#039;email-step&#039;, async () =&gt; {
    return {
      subject: &#039;E-mail Subject&#039;,
      body: renderReactEmail(&lt;ReactEmailComponent events={digestedEvents} /&gt;);
    }
  }, {
    // Step-level inputs defined in code and controlled in the novu Cloud UI by a Non-Technical Team member
    inputSchema: {
      // ...JSON Schema
    },
    providers: {
      sendgrid: async (inputs) =&gt; {
        // Echo runs as part of your application, so you have access to your database or resources

        return {
          to: email,
          ipPoolName: &#039;custom-pool&#039;
        };
      }
    },
    skip: () =&gt; {
      // Write custom skip logic
      return inAppResponse.seen || subscriber.isOnline;
    }
  });
// Define your workflow trigger payload using json schema and custom validation;
}, {
  payloadSchema: {
    // ...JSON Schema
  }
});

## Embeddable Notification Center

Using the Novu API and admin panel, you can easily add a real-time notification center to your web app without building it yourself. You can use our [React](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/react/get-started?utm_campaign=github-readme) / [Vue](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/vue?utm_campaign=github-readme) / [Angular](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/angular?utm_campaign=github-readme) components or an [iframe embed](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/iframe?utm_campaign=github-readme), as well as a [Web component](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/web-component?utm_campaign=github-readme).

# Zero

An Open-Source Gmail Alternative for the Future of Email

## What is Zero?

Zero is an open-source AI email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to modernize and improve emails through AI agents to truly modernize emails.

## Why Zero?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**.
0.email is different:

- ✅ **Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, fully transparent.
- 🦾 **AI Driven** - Enhance your emails with Agents &amp; LLMs.
- 🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your emails, your data. Zero does not track, collect, or sell your data in any way. Please note: while we integrate with external services, the data passed through them is not under our control and falls under their respective privacy policies and terms of service.
- ⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own email app with ease.
- 📬 **Unified Inbox** – Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.
- 🎨 **Customizable UI &amp; Features** – Tailor your email experience the way you want it.
- 🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Tech Stack

Zero is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth
&lt;!-- - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library --&gt;

## Getting Started

     - Go to [`Audience`](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)
     - Under &#039;Test users&#039; click &#039;Add Users&#039;
     - Add your email and click &#039;Save&#039;

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console must match **exactly** what you configure in the `.env`, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and path - these are provided above.

3. **Autumn Setup** (Required for some encryption)

   - Go to [Autumn](https://useautumn.com/)
   - For Local Use, click [onboarding](https://app.useautumn.com/sandbox/onboarding) button and generate an Autumn Secret Key
   - For production, select the production mode from upper left corner and generate and fill the other fields. After that, generate an Autumn Secret Key

   - Add to `.env`:

   ```env
   AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY=your_autumn_secret
   ```

4. **Twilio Setup** (Required for SMS Integration)

   - Go to the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
   - Create a Twilio account if you don’t already have one
   - From the dashboard, locate your:

     - Account SID
     - Auth Token
     - Phone Number

   - Add to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
   ```

### Environment Variables

Run `pnpm nizzy env` to setup your environment variables. It will copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables for you.
For local development a connection string example is provided in the `.env.example` file located in the same folder as the database.

### Database Setup

Zero uses PostgreSQL for storing data. Here&#039;s how to set it up:

1. **Start the Database**

   Run this command to start a local PostgreSQL instance:

   ```bash
   pnpm docker:db:up
   ```

   This creates a database with:

   - Name: `zerodotemail`
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `postgres`
   - Port: `5432`

2. **Set Up Database Connection**

   Make sure your database connection string is in `.env` file. And you have ran `pnpm nizzy sync` to sync the latest env.

   For local development use:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&quot;postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/zerodotemail&quot;
   ```

3. **Database Commands**

   - **Set up database tables**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:push
     ```

   - **Create migration files** (after schema changes):

     ```bash
     pnpm db:generate
     ```

   - **Apply migrations**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:migrate
     ```

   - **View database content**:
     ```bash
     pnpm db:studio
     ```
     &gt; If you run `pnpm dev` in your terminal, the studio command should be automatically running with the app.

### Sync

Background: https://x.com/cmdhaus/status/1940886269950902362
We&#039;re now storing the user&#039;s emails in their Durable Object &amp; an R2 bucket. This allow us to speed things up, a lot.
This also introduces 3 environment variables, `DROP_AGENT_TABLES`,`THREAD_SYNC_MAX_COUNT`, `THREAD_SYNC_LOOP`.
`DROP_AGENT_TABLES`: should the durable object drop the threads table before starting a sync
`THREAD_SYNC_MAX_COUNT`: how many threads should we sync? max `500` because it&#039;s using the same number for the maxResults number from the driver. i.e 500 results per page.
`THREAD_SYNC_LOOP`: should make sure to sync all of the items inside a folder? i.e if THREAD_SYNC_MAX_COUNT=500 it will sync 500 threads per request until the folder is fully synced. (should be true in production)

## Features

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router
  - Advanced routing for seamless navigation and performance
  - React Server Components (RSCs) and Server Actions for server-side rendering and increased performance
- [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction)
  - Unified API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs
  - Hooks for building dynamic chat and generative user interfaces
  - Supports xAI (default), OpenAI, Fireworks, and other model providers
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
  - Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - Component primitives from [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) for accessibility and flexibility
- Data Persistence
  - [Neon Serverless Postgres](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon) for saving chat history and user data
  - [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/storage/blob) for efficient file storage
- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
  - Simple and secure authentication

## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. The default configuration includes [xAI](https://x.ai) models (`grok-2-vision-1212`, `grok-3-mini`) routed through the gateway.

### AI Gateway Authentication

**For Vercel deployments**: Authentication is handled automatically via OIDC tokens.

**For non-Vercel deployments**: You need to provide an AI Gateway API key by setting the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to direct LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It&#039;s recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

&gt; Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🔥 Core Features (V2.0.0)

- 1. 💎 **Generate First Version Workflow**: Based on your text description, we provide workflows that meet your needs, returning 3 high-quality workflows from our library and 1 AI-generated workflow. You can import them into ComfyUI with one click to start generating images.
  - Simply type in the input box: I want a workflow for xxx.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/工作流生成.gif&quot;/&gt;
  
- 2. 💎 **Workflow Debug**: Automatically analyze errors in workflows, help you fix parameter errors and workflow connection errors, and provide optimization suggestions.
  - Among the 4 workflows returned above, when you select one and click Accept, it will be imported into the ComfyUI canvas. At this time, you can click the Debug button to start debugging.
  - There is a Debug button in the upper right corner of the input box. Click it to directly debug the workflow on the current canvas.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/debug.gif&quot;/&gt;
  - If a missing model is identified, it will automatically prompt you to download the model.
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/Debug模型下载.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  - You can also directly click the Model Download button below, enter the model keyword, and select the required model from the recommended models.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/模型下载.jpg&quot;/&gt;

- 3. 💎 **Unsatisfied with Previous Workflow Results?**: Tell us what you&#039;re not satisfied with, and let us help you modify the workflow, add nodes, modify parameters, and optimize workflow structure.
  - Type in the input box: Help me add xxx to the current canvas.
  - Note: If the model is new after May 2025, such as wan2.2, it may cause the LLM to fail to understand and the process to interrupt. You can try adding expert experience to help the LLM better generate workflows.
  - The workflow rewrite is difficult, and it carries a lot of context, so you need to control the context length, otherwise it is easy to interrupt. It is recommended to often click the Clear Context button in the upper right corner to control the conversation length.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/改写.gif&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/expert_add.jpg&quot;/&gt;

- 4. 💎 **Parameter Tuning Too Painful?**: We provide parameter tuning tools. You can set parameter ranges, and the system will automatically batch execute different parameter combinations and generate visual comparison results to help you quickly find the optimal parameter configuration.
  - Switch to the GenLab tab and follow the guidance. Note that the workflow must be able to run normally at this time to batch generate and evaluate parameters.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/Genlab.gif&quot;/&gt;

Want ComfyUI-Copilot to assist you in workflow development?
- 5. 💎 **Node Recommendations**: Based on your description, recommend nodes you might need and provide recommendation reasons.
  - Type in the input box: I want a node for xxx.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/节点推荐.gif&quot;/&gt;

- 6. 💎 **Node Query System**: Select a node on the canvas, click the node query button to explore the node in depth, view its description, parameter definitions, usage tips, and downstream workflow recommendations.
  - Type in the input box: What&#039;s the usage, input and output of node xxx.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/节点信息查询.gif&quot;/&gt;

- 7. 💎 **Model Recommendations**: Based on your text requirements, Copilot helps you find base models and &#039;lora&#039;.
  - Type in the input box: I want a Lora that generates xxx images.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/模型推荐.gif&quot;/&gt;

- 8. 💎 **Downstream Node Recommendations**: After you select a node on the canvas, based on the existing nodes on your canvas, recommend downstream subgraphs you might need.
