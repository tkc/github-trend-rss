**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone&#039;s hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn&#039;t trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it&#039;s trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you&#039;re using

The process is entirely local:
- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the [website](https://handy.computer)
2. Install the application following platform-specific instructions
3. Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## Known Issues &amp; Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Platform Support
- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don&#039;t meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**
- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  * Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**
- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

### How to Contribute

1. **Check existing issues** at [github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues)
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Test thoroughly** on your target platform
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description of changes
5. **Join the discussion** - reach out at [contact@handy.computer](mailto:contact@handy.computer)

The goal is to create both a useful tool and a foundation for others to build upon—a well-patterned, simple codebase that serves the community.

## What is AFFiNE

[AFFiNE](https://affine.pro) is an open-source, all-in-one workspace and an operating system for all the building blocks that assemble your knowledge base and much more -- wiki, knowledge management, presentation and digital assets. It&#039;s a better alternative to Notion and Miro.

## Features

**A true canvas for blocks in any form. Docs and whiteboard are now fully merged.**

- Many editor apps claim to be a canvas for productivity, but AFFiNE is one of the very few which allows you to put any building block on an edgeless canvas -- rich text, sticky notes, any embedded web pages, multi-view databases, linked pages, shapes and even slides. We have it all.

**Multimodal AI partner ready to kick in any work**

- Write up professional work report? Turn an outline into expressive and presentable slides? Summary an article into a well-structured mindmap? Sorting your job plan and backlog for tasks? Or... draw and code prototype apps and web pages directly all with one prompt? With you, [AFFiNE AI](https://affine.pro/ai) pushes your creativity to the edge of your imagination, just like [Canvas AI](https://affine.pro/blog/best-canvas-ai) to generate mind map for brainstorming.

**Local-first &amp; Real-time collaborative**

- We love the idea of local-first that you always own your data on your disk, in spite of the cloud. Furthermore, AFFiNE supports real-time sync and collaborations on web and cross-platform clients.

**Self-host &amp; Shape your own AFFiNE**

- You have the freedom to manage, self-host, fork and build your own AFFiNE. Plugin community and third-party blocks are coming soon. More tractions on [Blocksuite](https://blocksuite.io). Check there to learn how to [self-host AFFiNE](https://docs.affine.pro/self-host-affine).

## Acknowledgement

“We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us”. A lot of pioneers have inspired us along the way, e.g.:

- Quip &amp; Notion with their great concept of “everything is a block”
- Trello with their Kanban
- Airtable &amp; Miro with their no-code programmable datasheets
- Miro &amp; Whimiscal with their edgeless visual whiteboard
- Remote &amp; Capacities with their object-based tag system

There is a large overlap of their atomic “building blocks” between these apps. They are not open source, nor do they have a plugin system like Vscode for contributors to customize. We want to have something that contains all the features we love and also goes one step even further.

Thanks for checking us out, we appreciate your interest and sincerely hope that AFFiNE resonates with you! 🎵 Checking https://affine.pro/ for more details ions.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># x402 payments protocol

&gt; &quot;1 line of code to accept digital dollars. No fee, 2 second settlement, $0.001 minimum payment.&quot;

```typescript
app.use(
  // How much you want to charge, and where you want the funds to land
  paymentMiddleware(&quot;0xYourAddress&quot;, { &quot;/your-endpoint&quot;: &quot;$0.01&quot; })
);
// That&#039;s it! See examples/typescript/servers/express.ts for a complete example. Instruction below for running on base-sepolia.
```

## Philosophy

Payments on the internet are fundamentally flawed. Credit Cards are high friction, hard to accept, have minimum payments that are far too high, and don&#039;t fit into the programmatic nature of the internet.
It&#039;s time for an open, internet-native form of payments. A payment rail that doesn&#039;t have high minimums + % based fee. Payments that are amazing for humans and AI agents.

## Principles

- **Open standard:** the x402 protocol will never force reliance on a single party
- **HTTP Native:** x402 is meant to seamlessly complement the existing HTTP request made by traditional web services, it should not mandate additional requests outside the scope of a typical client / server flow.
- **Chain and token agnostic:** we welcome contributions that add support for new chains, signing standards, or schemes, so long as they meet our acceptance criteria laid out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Trust minimizing:** all payment schemes must not allow for the facilitator or resource server to move funds, other than in accordance with client intentions
- **Easy to use:** x402 needs to be 10x better than existing ways to pay on the internet. This means abstracting as many details of crypto as possible away from the client and resource server, and into the facilitator. This means the client/server should not need to think about gas, rpc, etc.

## Ecosystem

The x402 ecosystem is growing! Check out our [ecosystem page](https://x402.org/ecosystem) to see projects building with x402, including:

- Client-side integrations
- Services and endpoints
- Ecosystem infrastructure and tooling
- Learning and community resources

Want to add your project to the ecosystem? See our [demo site README](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/typescript/site#adding-your-project-to-the-ecosystem) for detailed instructions on how to submit your project.

**Roadmap:** see [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

## Terms:

- `resource`: Something on the internet. This could be a webpage, file server, RPC service, API, any resource on the internet that accepts HTTP / HTTPS requests.
- `client`: An entity wanting to pay for a resource.
- `facilitator server`: A server that facilitates verification and execution of on-chain payments.
- `resource server`: An HTTP server that provides an API or other resource for a client.

## Technical Goals:

- Permissionless and secure for clients and servers
- Gasless for client and resource servers
- Minimal integration for the resource server and client (1 line for the server, 1 function for the client)
- Ability to trade off speed of response for guarantee of payment
- Extensible to different payment flows and chains

## V1 Protocol

The `x402` protocol is a chain agnostic standard for payments on top of HTTP, leverage the existing `402 Payment Required` HTTP status code to indicate that a payment is required for access to the resource.

It specifies:

1. A schema for how servers can respond to clients to facilitate payment for a resource (`PaymentRequirements`)
2. A standard header `X-PAYMENT` that is set by clients paying for resources
3. A standard schema and encoding method for data in the `X-PAYMENT` header
4. A recommended flow for how payments should be verified and settled by a resource server
5. A REST specification for how a resource server can perform verification and settlement against a remote 3rd party server (`facilitator`)
6. A specification for a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header that can be used by resource servers to communicate blockchain transactions details to the client in their HTTP response

### V1 Protocol Sequencing

![](./static/x402-protocol-flow.png)

The following outlines the flow of a payment using the `x402` protocol. Note that steps (1) and (2) are optional if the client already knows the payment details accepted for a resource.

1. `Client` makes an HTTP request to a `resource server`.

2. `Resource server` responds with a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

3. `Client` selects one of the `paymentRequirements` returned by the server response and creates a `Payment Payload` based on the `scheme` of the `paymentRequirements` they have selected.

4. `Client` sends the HTTP request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the `Payment Payload` to the resource server.

5. `Resource server` verifies the `Payment Payload` is valid either via local verification or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment Requirements` to the `/verify` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

6. `Facilitator server` performs verification of the object based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload` and returns a `Verification Response`.

7. If the `Verification Response` is valid, the resource server performs the work to fulfill the request. If the `Verification Response` is invalid, the resource server returns a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

8. `Resource server` either settles the payment by interacting with a blockchain directly, or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment PaymentRequirements` to the `/settle` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

9. `Facilitator server` submits the payment to the blockchain based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload`.

10. `Facilitator server` waits for the payment to be confirmed on the blockchain.

11. `Facilitator server` returns a `Payment Execution Response` to the resource server.

12. `Resource server` returns a `200 OK` response to the `Client` with the resource they requested as the body of the HTTP response, and a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing the `Settlement Response` as Base64 encoded JSON if the payment was executed successfully.

### Type Specifications

#### Data types

**Payment Required Response**

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: int,

  // List of payment requirements that the resource server accepts. A resource server may accept on multiple chains, or in multiple currencies.
  accepts: [paymentRequirements]

  // Message from the resource server to the client to communicate errors in processing payment
  error: string
}
```

**paymentRequirements**

```json5
{
  // Scheme of the payment protocol to use
  scheme: string;

  // Network of the blockchain to send payment on
  network: string;

  // Maximum amount required to pay for the resource in atomic units of the asset
  maxAmountRequired: uint256 as string;

  // URL of resource to pay for
  resource: string;

  // Description of the resource
  description: string;

  // MIME type of the resource response
  mimeType: string;

  // Output schema of the resource response
  outputSchema?: object | null;

  // Address to pay value to
  payTo: string;

  // Maximum time in seconds for the resource server to respond
  maxTimeoutSeconds: number;

  // Address of the EIP-3009 compliant ERC20 contract
  asset: string;

  // Extra information about the payment details specific to the scheme
  // For `exact` scheme on a EVM network, expects extra to contain the records `name` and `version` pertaining to asset
  extra: object | null;
}
```

**`Payment Payload`** (included as the `X-PAYMENT` header in base64 encoded json)

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: number;

  // scheme is the scheme value of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  scheme: string;

  // network is the network id of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  network: string;

  // payload is scheme dependent
  payload: &lt;scheme dependent&gt;;
}
```

#### Facilitator Types &amp; Interface

A `facilitator server` is a 3rd party service that can be used by a `resource server` to verify and settle payments, without the `resource server` needing to have access to a blockchain node or wallet.

**POST /verify**. Verify a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:
  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    isValid: boolean;
    invalidReason: string | null;
  }
  ```

**POST /settle**. Settle a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:

  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```

- Response:

  ```json5
  {
    // Whether the payment was successful
    success: boolean;

    // Error message from the facilitator server
    error: string | null;

    // Transaction hash of the settled payment
    txHash: string | null;

    // Network id of the blockchain the payment was settled on
    networkId: string | null;
  }
  ```

**GET /supported**. Get supported payment schemes and networks:

- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    kinds: [
      {
        &quot;scheme&quot;: string,
        &quot;network&quot;: string,
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Schemes

A scheme is a logical way of moving money.

Blockchains allow for a large number of flexible ways to move money. To help facilitate an expanding number of payment use cases, the `x402` protocol is extensible to different ways of settling payments via its `scheme` field.

Each payment scheme may have different operational functionality depending on what actions are necessary to fulfill the payment.
For example `exact`, the first scheme shipping as part of the protocol, would have different behavior than `upto`. `exact` transfers a specific amount (ex: pay $1 to read an article), while a theoretical `upto` would transfer up to an amount, based on the resources consumed during a request (ex: generating tokens from an LLM).

See `specs/schemes` for more details on schemes, and see `specs/schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md` to see the first proposed scheme for exact payment on EVM chains.

### Schemes vs Networks

Because a scheme is a logical way of moving money, the way a scheme is implemented can be different for different blockchains. (ex: the way you need to implement `exact` on Ethereum is very different from the way you need to implement `exact` on Solana).

Clients and facilitators must explicitly support different `(scheme, network)` pairs in order to be able to create proper payloads and verify / settle payments.

## Running example

**Requirements:** Node.js v24 or higher

1. From `examples/typescript` run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to ensure all dependent packages and examples are setup.

2. Select a server, i.e. express, and `cd` into that example. Add your server&#039;s ethereum address to get paid to into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

3. Select a client, i.e. axios, and `cd` into that example. Add your private key for the account making payments into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

You should see activities in the client terminal, which will display a weather report.

## Running tests

1. Navigate to the typescript directory: `cd typescript`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the unit tests: `pnpm test`

This will run the unit tests for the x402 packages.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

&lt;b&gt;Also!&lt;/b&gt; If you haven&#039;t yet, please check out the underlying library this is built on by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markmanx/isoflow&quot;&gt;@markmanx&lt;/a&gt; I truly stand on the shoulders of a giant here 🫡

FossFLOW is a powerful, open-source Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating beautiful isometric diagrams. Built with React and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/markmanx/isoflow&quot;&gt;Isoflow&lt;/a&gt; (Now forked and published to NPM as fossflow) library, it runs entirely in your browser with offline support.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Notion MCP Server

&gt; [!NOTE] 
&gt; 
&gt; We’ve introduced **Notion MCP**, a remote MCP server with the following improvements:
&gt; - Easy installation via standard OAuth. No need to fiddle with JSON or API token anymore.
&gt; - Powerful tools tailored to AI agents. These tools are designed with optimized token consumption in mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Learn more and try it out [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp)


![notion-mcp-sm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c07003c-8455-4636-b298-d60ffdf46cd8)

This project implements an [MCP server](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro). 

![mcp-demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ff90a7-7801-48a9-b807-f7dd47f0d3d6)

### Installation

#### 1. Setting up Integration in Notion:
Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new **internal** integration or select an existing one.

![Creating a Notion Integration token](docs/images/integrations-creation.png)

While we limit the scope of Notion API&#039;s exposed (for example, you will not be able to delete databases via MCP), there is a non-zero risk to workspace data by exposing it to LLMs. Security-conscious users may want to further configure the Integration&#039;s _Capabilities_. 

For example, you can create a read-only integration token by giving only &quot;Read content&quot; access from the &quot;Configuration&quot; tab:

![Notion Integration Token Capabilities showing Read content checked](docs/images/integrations-capabilities.png)

#### 2. Connecting content to integration:
Ensure relevant pages and databases are connected to your integration.

To do this, visit the **Access** tab in your internal integration settings. Edit access and select the pages you&#039;d like to use.
![Integration Access tab](docs/images/integration-access.png)

![Edit integration access](docs/images/page-access-edit.png)

Alternatively, you can grant page access individually. You&#039;ll need to visit the target page, and click on the 3 dots, and select &quot;Connect to integration&quot;. 

![Adding Integration Token to Notion Connections](docs/images/connections.png)

#### 3. Adding MCP config to your client:

##### Using npm:

**Cursor &amp; Claude:**

Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json` (MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`)

**Option 1: Using NOTION_TOKEN (recommended)**
```javascript
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;notionApi&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@notionhq/notion-mcp-server&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NOTION_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;ntn_****&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Using OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (for advanced use cases)**
```javascript
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;notionApi&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@notionhq/notion-mcp-server&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;Authorization\&quot;: \&quot;Bearer ntn_****\&quot;, \&quot;Notion-Version\&quot;: \&quot;2022-06-28\&quot; }&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Zed**

Add the following to your `settings.json`

```json
{
  &quot;context_servers&quot;: {
    &quot;some-context-server&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: {
        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
        &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@notionhq/notion-mcp-server&quot;],
        &quot;env&quot;: {
          &quot;OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;Authorization\&quot;: \&quot;Bearer ntn_****\&quot;, \&quot;Notion-Version\&quot;: \&quot;2022-06-28\&quot; }&quot;
        }
      },
      &quot;settings&quot;: {}
    }
  }
}
```

##### Using Docker:

There are two options for running the MCP server with Docker:

###### Option 1: Using the official Docker Hub image:

Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Using NOTION_TOKEN (recommended):**
```javascript
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;notionApi&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;NOTION_TOKEN&quot;,
        &quot;mcp/notion&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NOTION_TOKEN&quot;: &quot;ntn_****&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (for advanced use cases):**
```javascript
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;notionApi&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS&quot;,
        &quot;mcp/notion&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;Authorization\&quot;:\&quot;Bearer ntn_****\&quot;,\&quot;Notion-Version\&quot;:\&quot;2022-06-28\&quot;}&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This approach:
- Uses the official Docker Hub image
- Properly handles JSON escaping via environment variables
- Provides a more reliable configuration method

###### Option 2: Building the Docker image locally:

You can also build and run the Docker image locally. First, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose build
```

Then, add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Using NOTION_TOKEN (recommended):**
```javascript
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;notionApi&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_****&quot;,
        &quot;notion-mcp-server&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (for advanced use cases):**
```javascript
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;notionApi&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;,
        &quot;OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS={\&quot;Authorization\&quot;: \&quot;Bearer ntn_****\&quot;, \&quot;Notion-Version\&quot;: \&quot;2022-06-28\&quot;}&quot;,
        &quot;notion-mcp-server&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Don&#039;t forget to replace `ntn_****` with your integration secret. Find it from your integration configuration tab:

#### Installing via Smithery

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@makenotion/notion-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@makenotion/notion-mcp-server)

To install Notion API Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@makenotion/notion-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @makenotion/notion-mcp-server --client claude
```

### Transport Options

The Notion MCP Server supports two transport modes:

#### STDIO Transport (Default)
The default transport mode uses standard input/output for communication. This is the standard MCP transport used by most clients like Claude Desktop.

```bash
# Run with default stdio transport
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server

# Or explicitly specify stdio
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport stdio
```

#### Streamable HTTP Transport
For web-based applications or clients that prefer HTTP communication, you can use the Streamable HTTP transport:

```bash
# Run with Streamable HTTP transport on port 3000 (default)
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http

# Run on a custom port
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http --port 8080

# Run with a custom authentication token
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http --auth-token &quot;your-secret-token&quot;
```

When using Streamable HTTP transport, the server will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:&lt;port&gt;/mcp`.

##### Authentication
The Streamable HTTP transport requires bearer token authentication for security. You have three options:

**Option 1: Auto-generated token (recommended for development)**
```bash
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http
```
The server will generate a secure random token and display it in the console:
```
Generated auth token: a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab
Use this token in the Authorization header: Bearer a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab
```

**Option 2: Custom token via command line (recommended for production)**
```bash
npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http --auth-token &quot;your-secret-token&quot;
```

**Option 3: Custom token via environment variable (recommended for production)**
```bash
AUTH_TOKEN=&quot;your-secret-token&quot; npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http
```

The command line argument `--auth-token` takes precedence over the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable if both are provided.

##### Making HTTP Requests
All requests to the Streamable HTTP transport must include the bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
# Example request
curl -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer your-token-here&quot; \
     -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
     -H &quot;mcp-session-id: your-session-id&quot; \
     -d &#039;{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;initialize&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {}, &quot;id&quot;: 1}&#039; \
     http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

**Note:** Make sure to set either the `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable (recommended) or the `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` environment variable with your Notion integration token when using either transport mode.

### Examples

1. Using the following instruction
```
Comment &quot;Hello MCP&quot; on page &quot;Getting started&quot;
```

AI will correctly plan two API calls, `v1/search` and `v1/comments`, to achieve the task

2. Similarly, the following instruction will result in a new page named &quot;Notion MCP&quot; added to parent page &quot;Development&quot;
```
Add a page titled &quot;Notion MCP&quot; to page &quot;Development&quot;
```

3. You may also reference content ID directly
```
Get the content of page 1a6b35e6e67f802fa7e1d27686f017f2
```

### Development

Build

```
npm run build
```

Execute

```
npx -y --prefix /path/to/local/notion-mcp-server @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
```

Publish

```
npm publish --access public
```

&lt;/div&gt;

## 🎬 Get Started

### 📝 Prerequisites

- CPU &gt;= 4 cores
- RAM &gt;= 16 GB
- Disk &gt;= 50 GB
- Docker &gt;= 24.0.0 &amp; Docker Compose &gt;= v2.26.1
- [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/): Required only if you intend to use the code executor (sandbox) feature of RAGFlow.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux), see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 🚀 Start up the server

1. Ensure `vm.max_map_count` &gt;= 262144:

   &gt; To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; $ sysctl vm.max_map_count
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; # In this case, we set it to 262144:
   &gt; $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the
   &gt; `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   ```
3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don&#039;t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.
&gt; If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.

&gt; The command below downloads the `v0.21.1-slim` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.21.1-slim`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server.

```bash
   $ cd ragflow/docker
   # Use CPU for embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

   # To use GPU to accelerate embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   # sed -i &#039;1i DEVICE=gpu&#039; .env
   # docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

| RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?                    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| v0.21.1           | &amp;approx;9       | ✔️                  | Stable release             |
| v0.21.1-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                    | Stable release             |
| nightly           | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                    | _Unstable_ nightly build |

&gt; Note: Starting with `v0.22.0`, we ship only the slim edition and no longer append the **-slim** suffix to the image tag.

4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:

   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f docker-ragflow-cpu-1
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ```bash

         ____   ___    ______ ______ __
        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __
       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /
      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /
     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/

    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
   ```

   &gt; If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network anormal`
   &gt; error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.
   &gt;
5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.

   &gt; With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default
   &gt; HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.
   &gt;
6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update
   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.

   &gt; See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.
   &gt;

   _The show is on!_

## 🔧 Configurations

When it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:

- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and
  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.
- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.

&gt; The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service
&gt; configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.

To update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`
to `&lt;YOUR_SERVING_PORT&gt;:80`.

Updates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:

&gt; ```bash
&gt; $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
&gt; ```

### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity

RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:

1. Stop all running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.

2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.
3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.

## 🔧 Build a Docker image without embedding models

This image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

## 🔨 Launch service from source for development

1. Install `uv` and `pre-commit`, or skip this step if they are already installed:

   ```bash
   pipx install uv pre-commit
   ```
2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   cd ragflow/
   uv sync --python 3.10 # install RAGFlow dependent python modules
   uv run download_deps.py
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d
   ```

   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:

   ```

## General Usage

```js
import MapView from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;
```

or

```js
var MapView = require(&#039;react-native-maps&#039;);
```

This MapView component is built so that features on the map (such as Markers, Polygons, etc.) are
specified as children of the MapView itself. This provides an intuitive and react-like API for
declaratively controlling features on the map.

### Rendering a Map with an initial region

## MapView

```jsx
&lt;MapView
  initialRegion={{
    latitude: 37.78825,
    longitude: -122.4324,
    latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
    longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
  }}
/&gt;
```

### Using a MapView while controlling the region as state

```jsx
getInitialState() {
  return {
    region: {
      latitude: 37.78825,
      longitude: -122.4324,
      latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
      longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
    },
  };
}

onRegionChange(region) {
  this.setState({ region });
}

render() {
  return (
    &lt;MapView
      region={this.state.region}
      onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}
    /&gt;
  );
}
```

### Rendering a list of markers on a map

```jsx
import {Marker} from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

&lt;MapView region={this.state.region} onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}&gt;
  {this.state.markers.map((marker, index) =&gt; (
    &lt;Marker
      key={index}
      coordinate={marker.latlng}
      title={marker.title}
      description={marker.description}
    /&gt;
  ))}
&lt;/MapView&gt;;
```

### Rendering a Marker with a custom image

1. You need to generate an `png` image with various resolution (lets call them `custom_pin`) - for more information go to [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/resource-manager#import), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-images-to-your-xcode-project)
2. put all images in Android drawables and iOS assets dir
3. Now you can use the following code:

```jsx
&lt;Marker
  coordinate={{latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude}}
  image={{uri: &#039;custom_pin&#039;}}
/&gt;
```

Note: You can also pass the image binary data like `image={require(&#039;custom_pin.png&#039;)}`, but this will not scale good with the different screen sizes.

### Rendering a Marker with a custom view

Note: This has performance implications, if you wish for a simpler solution go with a custom image (save your self the headache)

```jsx
&lt;Marker coordinate={{latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude}}&gt;
  &lt;MyCustomMarkerView {...marker} /&gt;
&lt;/Marker&gt;
```

### Rendering a custom Marker with a custom Callout

```jsx
import {Callout} from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

&lt;Marker coordinate={marker.latlng}&gt;
  &lt;MyCustomMarkerView {...marker} /&gt;
  &lt;Callout&gt;
    &lt;MyCustomCalloutView {...marker} /&gt;
  &lt;/Callout&gt;
&lt;/Marker&gt;;
```

### Draggable Markers

```jsx
&lt;MapView initialRegion={...}&gt;
  &lt;Marker draggable
    coordinate={this.state.x}
    onDragEnd={(e) =&gt; this.setState({ x: e.nativeEvent.coordinate })}
  /&gt;
&lt;/MapView&gt;
```

### Using a custom Tile Overlay

#### Tile Overlay using tile server

```jsx
import {UrlTile} from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

&lt;MapView region={this.state.region} onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}&gt;
  &lt;UrlTile
    /**
     * The url template of the tile server. The patterns {x} {y} {z} will be replaced at runtime
     * For example, http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
     */
    urlTemplate={this.state.urlTemplate}
    /**
     * The maximum zoom level for this tile overlay. Corresponds to the maximumZ setting in
     * MKTileOverlay. iOS only.
     */
    maximumZ={19}
    /**
     * flipY allows tiles with inverted y coordinates (origin at bottom left of map)
     * to be used. Its default value is false.
     */
    flipY={false}
  /&gt;
&lt;/MapView&gt;;
```

For Android: add the following line in your AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot; /&gt;
```

For IOS: configure [App Transport Security](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) in your app

#### Tile Overlay using local tiles

Tiles can be stored locally within device using xyz tiling scheme and displayed as tile overlay as well. This is usefull especially for offline map usage when tiles are available for selected map region within device storage.

```jsx
import {LocalTile} from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

&lt;MapView region={this.state.region} onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}&gt;
  &lt;LocalTile
    /**
     * The path template of the locally stored tiles. The patterns {x} {y} {z} will be replaced at runtime
     * For example, /storage/emulated/0/mytiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
     */
    pathTemplate={this.state.pathTemplate}
    /**
     * The size of provided local tiles (usually 256 or 512).
     */
    tileSize={256}
  /&gt;
&lt;/MapView&gt;;
```

For Android: LocalTile is still just overlay over original map tiles. It means that if device is online, underlying tiles will be still downloaded. If original tiles download/display is not desirable set mapType to &#039;none&#039;. For example:

```
&lt;MapView
  mapType={Platform.OS == &quot;android&quot; ? &quot;none&quot; : &quot;standard&quot;}
&gt;
```

See [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Category:Tile_downloading) for how to download tiles for offline usage.

### Overlaying other components on the map

Place components that you wish to overlay `MapView` underneath the `MapView` closing tag. Absolutely position these elements.

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    &lt;MapView
      region={this.state.region}
    /&gt;
    &lt;OverlayComponent
      style={{position: &quot;absolute&quot;, bottom: 50}}
    /&gt;
  );
}
```

### Customizing the map style (Google Maps Only)

The `&lt;MapView provider=&quot;google&quot; googleMapId=&quot;yourStyledMapId&quot; /&gt;` Google Maps on iOS and Android supports styling via google cloud platform, the styled maps are published under a googleMapId, by simply setting the property googleMapId to the MapView you can use that styled map
more info here: [google map id](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id)

### MapView Events

The `&lt;MapView /&gt;` component and its child components have several events that you can subscribe to.
This example displays some of them in a log as a demonstration.

### Tracking Region / Location

![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UBoPSLlIKQ2dv7q.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77XWjqECvdgjx9oA.gif)

### Programmatically Changing Region

One can change the mapview&#039;s position using refs and component methods, or by passing in an updated
`region` prop. The component methods will allow one to animate to a given position like the native
API could.

![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UB7poyB6YJ0KPWU.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77Yc4wK3pzZusEbm.gif)

### Changing the style of the map

### Arbitrary React Views as Markers

![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UBcsCLoLQtksJxe.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UB1qGEM9jYni3KM.gif)

### Using the MapView with the Animated API

The `&lt;MapView /&gt;` component can be made to work with the Animated API, having the entire `region` prop
be declared as an animated value. This allows one to animate the zoom and position of the MapView along
with other gestures, giving a nice feel.

Further, Marker views can use the animated API to enhance the effect.

![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77XMw9IwS6QAv0nC.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UBdGQdM1GmVoIdq.gif)

Issue: Since android needs to render its marker views as a bitmap, the animations APIs may not be
compatible with the Marker views. Not sure if this can be worked around yet or not.

Markers&#039; coordinates can also be animated, as shown in this example:

![](http://i.giphy.com/xTcnTelp1OwGPu1Wh2.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/xTcnT6WVpwlCiQnFW8.gif)

### Polygon Creator

![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UAZWqQBkOzs8HE4.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77XVBRErNZl3zyWQ.gif)

### Other Overlays

So far, `&lt;Circle /&gt;`, `&lt;Polygon /&gt;`, and `&lt;Polyline /&gt;` are available to pass in as children to the
`&lt;MapView /&gt;` component.

![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77XZCH8JpEhzVcNG.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77XZyA0aYeOX5jsA.gif)

### Gradient Polylines (iOS MapKit only)

Gradient polylines can be created using the `strokeColors` prop of the `&lt;Polyline&gt;` component.

![](https://i.imgur.com/P7UeqAm.png?1)

### Default Markers

Default markers will be rendered unless a custom marker is specified. One can optionally adjust the
color of the default marker by using the `pinColor` prop.

![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77Y0pWKmUUnguHK0.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/3o6UBfk3I58VIwZjVe.gif)

### Custom Callouts

Callouts to markers can be completely arbitrary react views, similar to markers. As a result, they
can be interacted with like any other view.

Additionally, you can fall back to the standard behavior of just having a title/description through
the `&lt;Marker /&gt;`&#039;s `title` and `description` props.

Custom callout views can be the entire tooltip bubble, or just the content inside of the system
default bubble.

To handle press on specific subview of callout use `&lt;CalloutSubview /&gt;` with `onPress`.
See `Callouts.js` example.

![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77XNePGnMIIDpbnq.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/xT77YdU0HXryvoRqaQ.gif)

### Image-based Markers

Markers can be customized by just using images, and specified using the `image` prop.

![](http://i.imgur.com/mzrOjTR.png)

### Draggable Markers

Markers are draggable, and emit continuous drag events to update other UI during drags.

![](http://i.giphy.com/l2JImnZxdv1WbpQfC.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/l2JIhv4Jx6Ugx1EGI.gif)

### Lite Mode ( Android )

Enable lite mode on Android with `liteMode` prop. Ideal when having multiple maps in a View or ScrollView.

![](http://i.giphy.com/qZ2lAf18s89na.gif)

### On Poi Click (Google Maps Only)

Poi are clickable, you can catch the event to get its information (usually to get the full detail from Google Place using the placeId).

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3480VsCKnHr31uCLU3/giphy.gif)

### Animated Region

The MapView can accept an `AnimatedRegion` value as its `region` prop. This allows you to utilize the Animated API to control the map&#039;s center and zoom.

```jsx
import MapView, { AnimatedRegion, Animated } from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

getInitialState() {
  return {
    region: new AnimatedRegion({
      latitude: LATITUDE,
      longitude: LONGITUDE,
      latitudeDelta: LATITUDE_DELTA,
      longitudeDelta: LONGITUDE_DELTA,
    }),
  };
}

onRegionChange(region) {
  this.state.region.setValue(region);
}

render() {
  return (
    &lt;Animated
      region={this.state.region}
      onRegionChange={this.onRegionChange}
    /&gt;
  );
}
```

### Animated Marker Position

Markers can also accept an `AnimatedRegion` value as a coordinate.

```jsx
import MapView, { AnimatedRegion, MarkerAnimated } from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

getInitialState() {
  return {
    coordinate: new AnimatedRegion({
      latitude: LATITUDE,
      longitude: LONGITUDE,
    }),
  };
}

componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
  const duration = 500

  if (this.props.coordinate !== nextProps.coordinate) {
    if (Platform.OS === &#039;android&#039;) {
      if (this.marker) {
        this.marker.animateMarkerToCoordinate(
          nextProps.coordinate,
          duration
        );
      }
    } else {
      this.state.coordinate.timing({
        ...nextProps.coordinate,
        useNativeDriver: true, // defaults to false if not passed explicitly
        duration
      }).start();
    }
  }
}

render() {
  return (
    &lt;MapView initialRegion={...}&gt;
      &lt;MarkerAnimated
        ref={marker =&gt; { this.marker = marker }}
        coordinate={this.state.coordinate}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/MapView&gt;
  );
}
```

### Take Snapshot of map

```jsx
import MapView, { Marker } from &#039;react-native-maps&#039;;

getInitialState() {
  return {
    coordinate: {
      latitude: LATITUDE,
      longitude: LONGITUDE,
    },
  };
}

takeSnapshot () {
  // &#039;takeSnapshot&#039; takes a config object with the
  // following options
  const snapshot = this.map.takeSnapshot({
    width: 300,      // optional, when omitted the view-width is used
    height: 300,     // optional, when omitted the view-height is used
    region: {..},    // iOS only, optional region to render
    format: &#039;png&#039;,   // image formats: &#039;png&#039;, &#039;jpg&#039; (default: &#039;png&#039;)
    quality: 0.8,    // image quality: 0..1 (only relevant for jpg, default: 1)
    result: &#039;file&#039;   // result types: &#039;file&#039;, &#039;base64&#039; (default: &#039;file&#039;)
  });
  snapshot.then((uri) =&gt; {
    this.setState({ mapSnapshot: uri });
  });
}

render() {
  return (
    &lt;View&gt;
      &lt;MapView initialRegion={...} ref={map =&gt; { this.map = map }}&gt;
        &lt;Marker coordinate={this.state.coordinate} /&gt;
      &lt;/MapView&gt;
      &lt;Image source={{ uri: this.state.mapSnapshot.uri }} /&gt;
      &lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={this.takeSnapshot}&gt;
        Take Snapshot
      &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}
```

### Zoom to Specified Markers

Pass an array of marker identifiers to have the map re-focus.

![](http://i.giphy.com/3o7qEbOQnO0yoXqKJ2.gif) ![](http://i.giphy.com/l41YdrQZ7m6Dz4h0c.gif)

### Zoom to Specified Coordinates

Pass an array of coordinates to focus a map region on said coordinates.

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1627824/18609960/da5d9e06-7cdc-11e6-811e-34e255093df9.gif)

### Troubleshooting

#### My map is blank

- Make sure that you have [properly installed](docs/installation.md) react-native-maps.
- Check in the logs if there is more informations about the issue.
- Try setting the style of the MapView to an absolute position with top, left, right and bottom values set.
- Make sure you have enabled Google Maps API in [Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  map: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
  },
});
```

```jsx
&lt;MapView
  style={styles.map}
  // other props
/&gt;
```

#### Inputs don&#039;t focus

- When inputs don&#039;t focus or elements don&#039;t respond to tap, look at the order of the view hierarchy, sometimes the issue could be due to ordering of rendered components, prefer putting MapView as the first component.

Bad:

```jsx
&lt;View&gt;
  &lt;TextInput /&gt;
  &lt;MapView /&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
```

Good:

```jsx
&lt;View&gt;
  &lt;MapView /&gt;
  &lt;TextInput /&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
```

#### Children Components Not Re-Rendering

Components that aren&#039;t declared by this library (Ex: Markers, Polyline) must not be children of the MapView component due to MapView&#039;s unique rendering methodology. Have your custom components / views outside the MapView component and position absolute to ensure they only re-render as needed.
Example:
Bad:

```jsx
&lt;View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}&gt;
  &lt;MapView style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}&gt;
    &lt;View style={{position: &#039;absolute&#039;, top: 100, left: 50}} /&gt;
  &lt;/MapView&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
```

Good:

```jsx
&lt;View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject}&gt;
  &lt;MapView style={StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject} /&gt;
  &lt;View style={{position: &#039;absolute&#039;, top: 100, left: 50}} /&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
```

#### Crashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS on iOS when switching apps

`&lt;MapView&gt;` using Apple Maps in `mapType: &quot;standard&quot;` will sometimes crash when you background the app or switch into another app. This is only an issue in XCode using Metal API Validation, and won&#039;t happen in production. To eliminate this problem even while debugging in XCode, go to `Edit Scheme... -&gt; Run (Debug) -&gt; Diagnostics` and uncheck `Metal -&gt; API Validation`. (h/t [@Simon-TechForm](https://github.com/Simon-TechForm)).

#### onRegionChangeComplete() callback is called infinitely

If changing the state in `onRegionChangeComplete` is called infinitely, add a condition to limit these calls to occur only when the region change was done as a result of a user&#039;s action.

```javascript
onRegionChangeComplete={ (region, gesture) =&gt; {
	// This fix only works on Google Maps because isGesture is NOT available on Apple Maps
	if (!gesture.isGesture) {
    return;
  }

  // You can use
  dispatch({ type: &quot;map_region&quot;, payload: { mapRegion: region }}); // if using useReducer
	// setMapRegionState(region); // if using useState
}}
```

Qwen Code is a powerful command-line AI workflow tool adapted from [**Gemini CLI**](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) ([details](./README.gemini.md)), specifically optimized for [Qwen3-Coder](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder) models. It enhances your development workflow with advanced code understanding, automated tasks, and intelligent assistance.

## 💡 Free Options Available

Get started with Qwen Code at no cost using any of these free options:

### 🔥 Qwen OAuth (Recommended)

- **2,000 requests per day** with no token limits
- **60 requests per minute** rate limit
- Simply run `qwen` and authenticate with your qwen.ai account
- Automatic credential management and refresh
- Use `/auth` command to switch to Qwen OAuth if you have initialized with OpenAI compatible mode

### 🌏 Regional Free Tiers

- **Mainland China**: ModelScope offers **2,000 free API calls per day**
- **International**: OpenRouter provides **up to 1,000 free API calls per day** worldwide

For detailed setup instructions, see [Authorization](#authorization).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; **Token Usage Notice**: Qwen Code may issue multiple API calls per cycle, resulting in higher token usage (similar to Claude Code). We&#039;re actively optimizing API efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Code Understanding &amp; Editing** - Query and edit large codebases beyond traditional context window limits
- **Workflow Automation** - Automate operational tasks like handling pull requests and complex rebases
- **Enhanced Parser** - Adapted parser specifically optimized for Qwen-Coder models
- **Vision Model Support** - Automatically detect images in your input and seamlessly switch to vision-capable models for multimodal analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest
qwen --version
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code.git
cd qwen-code
npm install
npm install -g .
```

### Install globally with Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install qwen-code
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Qwen Code
qwen

# Example commands
&gt; Explain this codebase structure
&gt; Help me refactor this function
&gt; Generate unit tests for this module
```

### Session Management

Control your token usage with configurable session limits to optimize costs and performance.

#### Configure Session Token Limit

Create or edit `.qwen/settings.json` in your home directory:

```json
{
  &quot;sessionTokenLimit&quot;: 32000
}
```

#### Session Commands

- **`/compress`** - Compress conversation history to continue within token limits
- **`/clear`** - Clear all conversation history and start fresh
- **`/stats`** - Check current token usage and limits

&gt; 📝 **Note**: Session token limit applies to a single conversation, not cumulative API calls.

### Vision Model Configuration

Qwen Code includes intelligent vision model auto-switching that detects images in your input and can automatically switch to vision-capable models for multimodal analysis. **This feature is enabled by default** - when you include images in your queries, you&#039;ll see a dialog asking how you&#039;d like to handle the vision model switch.

#### Skip the Switch Dialog (Optional)

If you don&#039;t want to see the interactive dialog each time, configure the default behavior in your `.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;experimental&quot;: {
    &quot;vlmSwitchMode&quot;: &quot;once&quot;
  }
}
```

**Available modes:**

- **`&quot;once&quot;`** - Switch to vision model for this query only, then revert
- **`&quot;session&quot;`** - Switch to vision model for the entire session
- **`&quot;persist&quot;`** - Continue with current model (no switching)
- **Not set** - Show interactive dialog each time (default)

#### Command Line Override

You can also set the behavior via command line:

```bash
# Switch once per query
qwen --vlm-switch-mode once

# Switch for entire session
qwen --vlm-switch-mode session

# Never switch automatically
qwen --vlm-switch-mode persist
```

#### Disable Vision Models (Optional)

To completely disable vision model support, add to your `.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  &quot;experimental&quot;: {
    &quot;visionModelPreview&quot;: false
  }
}
```

&gt; 💡 **Tip**: In YOLO mode (`--yolo`), vision switching happens automatically without prompts when images are detected.

### Authorization

Choose your preferred authentication method based on your needs:

#### 1. Qwen OAuth (🚀 Recommended - Start in 30 seconds)

The easiest way to get started - completely free with generous quotas:

```bash
# Just run this command and follow the browser authentication
qwen
```

**What happens:**

1. **Instant Setup**: CLI opens your browser automatically
2. **One-Click Login**: Authenticate with your qwen.ai account
3. **Automatic Management**: Credentials cached locally for future use
4. **No Configuration**: Zero setup required - just start coding!

**Free Tier Benefits:**

- ✅ **2,000 requests/day** (no token counting needed)
- ✅ **60 requests/minute** rate limit
- ✅ **Automatic credential refresh**
- ✅ **Zero cost** for individual users
- ℹ️ **Note**: Model fallback may occur to maintain service quality

#### 2. OpenAI-Compatible API

Use API keys for OpenAI or other compatible providers:

**Configuration Methods:**

1. **Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your_api_key_here&quot;
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=&quot;your_api_endpoint&quot;
   export OPENAI_MODEL=&quot;your_model_choice&quot;
   ```

2. **Project `.env` File**
   Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=your_api_endpoint
   OPENAI_MODEL=your_model_choice
   ```
