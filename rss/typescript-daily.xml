            <h2>README</h2><pre># x402 payments protocol

&gt; &quot;1 line of code to accept digital dollars. No fee, 2 second settlement, $0.001 minimum payment.&quot;

```typescript
app.use(
  // How much you want to charge, and where you want the funds to land
  paymentMiddleware(&quot;0xYourAddress&quot;, { &quot;/your-endpoint&quot;: &quot;$0.01&quot; })
);
// That&#039;s it! See examples/typescript/servers/express.ts for a complete example. Instruction below for running on base-sepolia.
```

## Philosophy

Payments on the internet are fundamentally flawed. Credit Cards are high friction, hard to accept, have minimum payments that are far too high, and don&#039;t fit into the programmatic nature of the internet.
It&#039;s time for an open, internet-native form of payments. A payment rail that doesn&#039;t have high minimums + % based fee. Payments that are amazing for humans and AI agents.

## Principles

- **Open standard:** the x402 protocol will never force reliance on a single party
- **HTTP Native:** x402 is meant to seamlessly complement the existing HTTP request made by traditional web services, it should not mandate additional requests outside the scope of a typical client / server flow.
- **Chain and token agnostic:** we welcome contributions that add support for new chains, signing standards, or schemes, so long as they meet our acceptance criteria laid out in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Trust minimizing:** all payment schemes must not allow for the facilitator or resource server to move funds, other than in accordance with client intentions
- **Easy to use:** x402 needs to be 10x better than existing ways to pay on the internet. This means abstracting as many details of crypto as possible away from the client and resource server, and into the facilitator. This means the client/server should not need to think about gas, rpc, etc.

## Ecosystem

The x402 ecosystem is growing! Check out our [ecosystem page](https://x402.org/ecosystem) to see projects building with x402, including:

- Client-side integrations
- Services and endpoints
- Ecosystem infrastructure and tooling
- Learning and community resources

Want to add your project to the ecosystem? See our [demo site README](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/typescript/site#adding-your-project-to-the-ecosystem) for detailed instructions on how to submit your project.

**Roadmap:** see [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

## Terms:

- `resource`: Something on the internet. This could be a webpage, file server, RPC service, API, any resource on the internet that accepts HTTP / HTTPS requests.
- `client`: An entity wanting to pay for a resource.
- `facilitator server`: A server that facilitates verification and execution of on-chain payments.
- `resource server`: An HTTP server that provides an API or other resource for a client.

## Technical Goals:

- Permissionless and secure for clients and servers
- Gasless for client and resource servers
- Minimal integration for the resource server and client (1 line for the server, 1 function for the client)
- Ability to trade off speed of response for guarantee of payment
- Extensible to different payment flows and chains

## V1 Protocol

The `x402` protocol is a chain agnostic standard for payments on top of HTTP, leverage the existing `402 Payment Required` HTTP status code to indicate that a payment is required for access to the resource.

It specifies:

1. A schema for how servers can respond to clients to facilitate payment for a resource (`PaymentRequirements`)
2. A standard header `X-PAYMENT` that is set by clients paying for resources
3. A standard schema and encoding method for data in the `X-PAYMENT` header
4. A recommended flow for how payments should be verified and settled by a resource server
5. A REST specification for how a resource server can perform verification and settlement against a remote 3rd party server (`facilitator`)
6. A specification for a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header that can be used by resource servers to communicate blockchain transactions details to the client in their HTTP response

### V1 Protocol Sequencing

![](./static/x402-protocol-flow.png)

The following outlines the flow of a payment using the `x402` protocol. Note that steps (1) and (2) are optional if the client already knows the payment details accepted for a resource.

1. `Client` makes an HTTP request to a `resource server`.

2. `Resource server` responds with a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

3. `Client` selects one of the `paymentRequirements` returned by the server response and creates a `Payment Payload` based on the `scheme` of the `paymentRequirements` they have selected.

4. `Client` sends the HTTP request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the `Payment Payload` to the resource server.

5. `Resource server` verifies the `Payment Payload` is valid either via local verification or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment Requirements` to the `/verify` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

6. `Facilitator server` performs verification of the object based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload` and returns a `Verification Response`.

7. If the `Verification Response` is valid, the resource server performs the work to fulfill the request. If the `Verification Response` is invalid, the resource server returns a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.

8. `Resource server` either settles the payment by interacting with a blockchain directly, or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment PaymentRequirements` to the `/settle` endpoint of a `facilitator server`.

9. `Facilitator server` submits the payment to the blockchain based on the `scheme` and `network` of the `Payment Payload`.

10. `Facilitator server` waits for the payment to be confirmed on the blockchain.

11. `Facilitator server` returns a `Payment Execution Response` to the resource server.

12. `Resource server` returns a `200 OK` response to the `Client` with the resource they requested as the body of the HTTP response, and a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing the `Settlement Response` as Base64 encoded JSON if the payment was executed successfully.

### Type Specifications

#### Data types

**Payment Required Response**

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: int,

  // List of payment requirements that the resource server accepts. A resource server may accept on multiple chains, or in multiple currencies.
  accepts: [paymentRequirements]

  // Message from the resource server to the client to communicate errors in processing payment
  error: string
}
```

**paymentRequirements**

```json5
{
  // Scheme of the payment protocol to use
  scheme: string;

  // Network of the blockchain to send payment on
  network: string;

  // Maximum amount required to pay for the resource in atomic units of the asset
  maxAmountRequired: uint256 as string;

  // URL of resource to pay for
  resource: string;

  // Description of the resource
  description: string;

  // MIME type of the resource response
  mimeType: string;

  // Output schema of the resource response
  outputSchema?: object | null;

  // Address to pay value to
  payTo: string;

  // Maximum time in seconds for the resource server to respond
  maxTimeoutSeconds: number;

  // Address of the EIP-3009 compliant ERC20 contract
  asset: string;

  // Extra information about the payment details specific to the scheme
  // For `exact` scheme on a EVM network, expects extra to contain the records `name` and `version` pertaining to asset
  extra: object | null;
}
```

**`Payment Payload`** (included as the `X-PAYMENT` header in base64 encoded json)

```json5
{
  // Version of the x402 payment protocol
  x402Version: number;

  // scheme is the scheme value of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  scheme: string;

  // network is the network id of the accepted `paymentRequirements` the client is using to pay
  network: string;

  // payload is scheme dependent
  payload: &lt;scheme dependent&gt;;
}
```

#### Facilitator Types &amp; Interface

A `facilitator server` is a 3rd party service that can be used by a `resource server` to verify and settle payments, without the `resource server` needing to have access to a blockchain node or wallet.

**POST /verify**. Verify a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:
  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    isValid: boolean;
    invalidReason: string | null;
  }
  ```

**POST /settle**. Settle a payment with a supported scheme and network:

- Request body JSON:

  ```json5
  {
    x402Version: number;
    paymentHeader: string;
    paymentRequirements: paymentRequirements;
  }
  ```

- Response:

  ```json5
  {
    // Whether the payment was successful
    success: boolean;

    // Error message from the facilitator server
    error: string | null;

    // Transaction hash of the settled payment
    txHash: string | null;

    // Network id of the blockchain the payment was settled on
    networkId: string | null;
  }
  ```

**GET /supported**. Get supported payment schemes and networks:

- Response:
  ```json5
  {
    kinds: [
      {
        &quot;scheme&quot;: string,
        &quot;network&quot;: string,
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Schemes

A scheme is a logical way of moving money.

Blockchains allow for a large number of flexible ways to move money. To help facilitate an expanding number of payment use cases, the `x402` protocol is extensible to different ways of settling payments via its `scheme` field.

Each payment scheme may have different operational functionality depending on what actions are necessary to fulfill the payment.
For example `exact`, the first scheme shipping as part of the protocol, would have different behavior than `upto`. `exact` transfers a specific amount (ex: pay $1 to read an article), while a theoretical `upto` would transfer up to an amount, based on the resources consumed during a request (ex: generating tokens from an LLM).

See `specs/schemes` for more details on schemes, and see `specs/schemes/exact/scheme_exact_evm.md` to see the first proposed scheme for exact payment on EVM chains.

### Schemes vs Networks

Because a scheme is a logical way of moving money, the way a scheme is implemented can be different for different blockchains. (ex: the way you need to implement `exact` on Ethereum is very different from the way you need to implement `exact` on Solana).

Clients and facilitators must explicitly support different `(scheme, network)` pairs in order to be able to create proper payloads and verify / settle payments.

## Running example

**Requirements:** Node.js v24 or higher

1. From `examples/typescript` run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to ensure all dependent packages and examples are setup.

2. Select a server, i.e. express, and `cd` into that example. Add your server&#039;s ethereum address to get paid to into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

3. Select a client, i.e. axios, and `cd` into that example. Add your private key for the account making payments into the `.env` file, and then run `pnpm dev` in that directory.

You should see activities in the client terminal, which will display a weather report.

## Running tests

1. Navigate to the typescript directory: `cd typescript`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the unit tests: `pnpm test`

This will run the unit tests for the x402 packages.

**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.

## Why Handy?

Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on [handy.computer](https://handy.computer):

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone&#039;s hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handy isn&#039;t trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it&#039;s trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handy processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you&#039;re using

The process is entirely local:
- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the [website](https://handy.computer)
2. Install the application following platform-specific instructions
3. Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## Known Issues &amp; Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Platform Support
- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don&#039;t meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**
- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  * Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**
- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

### How to Contribute

1. **Check existing issues** at [github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues)
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Test thoroughly** on your target platform
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description of changes
5. **Join the discussion** - reach out at [contact@handy.computer](mailto:contact@handy.computer)

The goal is to create both a useful tool and a foundation for others to build upon—a well-patterned, simple codebase that serves the community.

NativeScript-Vue now supports Vue 3 and is generally available! This version brings improved reactivity, a modern plugin system, and better TypeScript support.

## Quick Start

To get started, you can use the [StackBlitz Template](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue/tree/main/packages/stackblitz-template?file=src%2Fcomponents%2FHome.vue&amp;title=NativeScript%20Starter%20Vue3).

Or, set up locally:

```sh
ns create myAwesomeApp --template @nativescript-vue/template-blank@latest

cd myAwesomeApp
ns run ios|android
```

## Upgrading to v3

Please refer to our [Upgrade Guide](https://nativescript-vue.org/docs/essentials/upgrade-guide).

## Using Vue Devtools

To enable Vue Devtools, run:

```sh
ns run ios|android --env.vueDevtools
```

🛠️ **Android Users:**
To allow Vue Devtools to connect, enable **cleartext HTTP traffic** in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```diff
&lt;application ...
+  android:usesCleartextTraffic=&quot;true&quot;
.../&gt;
```

## How To Use It

You can **just fork or clone** this repository and use it as is.

✨ It just works. ✨

### How to Use a Private Repository

If you want to have a private repository, GitHub won&#039;t allow you to simply fork it as it doesn&#039;t allow changing the visibility of forks.

But you can do the following:

- Create a new GitHub repo, for example `my-full-stack`.
- Clone this repository manually, set the name with the name of the project you want to use, for example `my-full-stack`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git my-full-stack
```

- Enter into the new directory:

```bash
cd my-full-stack
```

- Set the new origin to your new repository, copy it from the GitHub interface, for example:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git
```

- Add this repo as another &quot;remote&quot; to allow you to get updates later:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git
```

- Push the code to your new repository:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Update From the Original Template

After cloning the repository, and after doing changes, you might want to get the latest changes from this original template.

- Make sure you added the original repository as a remote, you can check it with:

```bash
git remote -v

origin    git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git (push)
```

- Pull the latest changes without merging:

```bash
git pull --no-commit upstream master
```

This will download the latest changes from this template without committing them, that way you can check everything is right before committing.

- If there are conflicts, solve them in your editor.

- Once you are done, commit the changes:

```bash
git merge --continue
```

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c &quot;import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))&quot;
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

## How To Use It - Alternative With Copier

This repository also supports generating a new project using [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io).

It will copy all the files, ask you configuration questions, and update the `.env` files with your answers.

### Install Copier

You can install Copier with:

```bash
pip install copier
```

Or better, if you have [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/), you can run it with:

```bash
pipx install copier
```

**Note**: If you have `pipx`, installing copier is optional, you could run it directly.

### Generate a Project With Copier

Decide a name for your new project&#039;s directory, you will use it below. For example, `my-awesome-project`.

Go to the directory that will be the parent of your project, and run the command with your project&#039;s name:

```bash
copier copy https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template my-awesome-project --trust
```

If you have `pipx` and you didn&#039;t install `copier`, you can run it directly:

```bash
pipx run copier copy https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template my-awesome-project --trust
```

**Note** the `--trust` option is necessary to be able to execute a [post-creation script](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/.copier/update_dotenv.py) that updates your `.env` files.

### Input Variables

Copier will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project.

But don&#039;t worry, you can just update any of that in the `.env` files afterwards.

The input variables, with their default values (some auto generated) are:

- `project_name`: (default: `&quot;FastAPI Project&quot;`) The name of the project, shown to API users (in .env).
- `stack_name`: (default: `&quot;fastapi-project&quot;`) The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name (no spaces, no periods) (in .env).
- `secret_key`: (default: `&quot;changethis&quot;`) The secret key for the project, used for security, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above.
- `first_superuser`: (default: `&quot;admin@example.com&quot;`) The email of the first superuser (in .env).
- `first_superuser_password`: (default: `&quot;changethis&quot;`) The password of the first superuser (in .env).
- `smtp_host`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The SMTP server host to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `smtp_user`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The SMTP server user to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `smtp_password`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The SMTP server password to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `emails_from_email`: (default: `&quot;info@example.com&quot;`) The email account to send emails from, you can set it later in .env.
- `postgres_password`: (default: `&quot;changethis&quot;`) The password for the PostgreSQL database, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above.
- `sentry_dsn`: (default: &quot;&quot;) The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it, you can set it later in .env.

## 🎯 What is Motia?

Backend development today is fragmented.

APIs live in one framework, background jobs in another, queues and schedulers elsewhere, and now AI agents and streaming systems have their own runtimes. Add observability and state management on top, and you&#039;re stitching together half a dozen tools before writing your first feature.

**Motia unifies all of these concerns around one core primitive: the Step.**

Just as React made frontend development simple by introducing components, Motia redefines backend development with Steps.

Every backend pattern, API endpoints, background jobs, queues, workflows, AI agents, streaming, observability, and state, is expressed with the same primitive.

To read more about this, check out our **[manifesto](https://motia.dev/manifesto)**.

---

## The Core Primitive: the Step

A Step is just a file with a `config` and a `handler`. Motia auto-discovers these files and connects them automatically.

Here&#039;s a simple example of two Steps working together: an API Step that emits an event, and an Event Step that processes it.

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;TypeScript&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```ts
// steps/send-message.step.ts
export const config = {
  name: &#039;SendMessage&#039;,
  type: &#039;api&#039;,
  path: &#039;/messages&#039;,
  method: &#039;POST&#039;,
  emits: [&#039;message.sent&#039;]
};

export const handler = async (req, { emit }) =&gt; {
  await emit({
    topic: &#039;message.sent&#039;,
    data: { text: req.body.text }
  });
  return { status: 200, body: { ok: true } };
};
```

```ts
// steps/process-message.step.ts
export const config = {
  name: &#039;ProcessMessage&#039;,
  type: &#039;event&#039;,
  subscribes: [&#039;message.sent&#039;]
};

export const handler = async (input, { logger }) =&gt; {
  logger.info(&#039;Processing message&#039;, input);
};
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details close&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Python&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
# send_message_step.py
config = {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SendMessage&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;api&quot;,
    &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/messages&quot;,
    &quot;method&quot;: &quot;POST&quot;,

## The xyflow mono repo

The xyflow repository is the home of four packages:
* React Flow 12 `@xyflow/react` [packages/react](./packages/react)
* React Flow 11 `reactflow` [v11 branch](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/tree/v11)
* Svelte Flow `@xyflow/svelte` [packages/svelte](./packages/svelte)
* Shared helper library `@xyflow/system` [packages/system](./packages/system)

## Commercial usage

**Are you using React Flow or Svelte Flow for a personal project?** Great! No sponsorship needed, you can support us by reporting any bugs you find, sending us screenshots of your projects, and starring us on Github 🌟

**Are you using React Flow or Svelte Flow at your organization and making money from it?** Awesome! We rely on your support to keep our libraries developed and maintained under an MIT License, just how we like it. For React Flow you can do that on the [React Flow Pro website](https://reactflow.dev/pro) and for both of our libraries you can do it through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/xyflow).

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to check out the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/learn) or [Svelte Flow](https://svelteflow.dev/learn) learn section. However if you want to get a sneak peek of how to install and use the libraries you can see it here: 

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Flow&lt;/strong&gt; basic usage&lt;/summary&gt;

  ### Installation
  
  ```sh
npm install @xyflow/react
  ```

  ### Basic usage
  ```jsx
import { useCallback } from &#039;react&#039;;
import {
  ReactFlow,
  MiniMap,
  Controls,
  Background,
  useNodesState,
  useEdgesState,
  addEdge,
} from &#039;@xyflow/react&#039;;

import &#039;@xyflow/react/dist/style.css&#039;;

const initialNodes = [
  { id: &#039;1&#039;, position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: &#039;1&#039; } },
  { id: &#039;2&#039;, position: { x: 0, y: 100 }, data: { label: &#039;2&#039; } },
];

const initialEdges = [{ id: &#039;e1-2&#039;, source: &#039;1&#039;, target: &#039;2&#039; }];

function Flow() {
  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  const onConnect = useCallback((params) =&gt; setEdges((eds) =&gt; addEdge(params, eds)), [setEdges]);

  return (
    &lt;ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
    &gt;
      &lt;MiniMap /&gt;
      &lt;Controls /&gt;
      &lt;Background /&gt;
    &lt;/ReactFlow&gt;
  );
}

export default Flow;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Svelte Flow&lt;/strong&gt; basic usage&lt;/summary&gt;

  ### Installation
  
  ```sh
npm install @xyflow/svelte
  ```

  ### Basic usage
  ```svelte
&lt;script lang=&quot;ts&quot;&gt;
  import { writable } from &#039;svelte/store&#039;;
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    Controls,
    Background,
    BackgroundVariant,
    MiniMap,
  } from &#039;@xyflow/svelte&#039;;

  import &#039;@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css&#039;
  
  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: &#039;1&#039;,
      type: &#039;input&#039;,
      data: { label: &#039;Input Node&#039; },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: &#039;2&#039;,
      type: &#039;custom&#039;,
      data: { label: &#039;Node&#039; },
      position: { x: 0, y: 150 }
    }
  ]);

  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: &#039;1-2&#039;,
      type: &#039;default&#039;,
      source: &#039;1&#039;,
      target: &#039;2&#039;,
      label: &#039;Edge Text&#039;
    }
  ]);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;SvelteFlow
  {nodes}
  {edges}
  fitView
  on:nodeclick={(event) =&gt; console.log(&#039;on node click&#039;, event)}
&gt;
  &lt;Controls /&gt;
  &lt;Background variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots} /&gt;
  &lt;MiniMap /&gt;
&lt;/SvelteFlow&gt;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Releases 

For releasing packages we are using [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) in combination with the [changeset Github action](https://github.com/changesets/action). The rough idea is:

1. create PRs for new features, updates and fixes (with a changeset if relevant for changelog)
2. merge into main 
3. changset creates a PR that bumps all packages based on the changesets 
4. merge changeset PR if you want to release to Github and npm

## Built by [xyflow](https://xyflow.com)

React Flow and Svelte Flow are maintained by the [xyflow team](https://xyflow.com/about). If you need help or want to talk to us about a collaboration, reach out through our [contact form](https://xyflow.com/contact) or by joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Bqt6xrs).
