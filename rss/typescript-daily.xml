patterns


What do we mean by &quot;high-quality&quot; components?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don&#039;t confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular developers.

## Browser and screen reader support
The Angular Components team supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and  Edge.

We aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:
* **Windows**: NVDA and JAWS with FF / Chrome.
* **macOS**: VoiceOver with Safari / Chrome.
* **iOS**: VoiceOver with Safari
* **Android**: Android Accessibility Suite (formerly TalkBack) with Chrome.
* **Chrome OS**: ChromeVox with Chrome.

&lt;/div&gt;

[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/) is a suite of advanced React UI components for a wide range of complex use cases.
Each component provides best-in-class UX and DX, with sophisticated UX workflows for data-rich applications.
Components include the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree View.

MUI X extends the core functionality of [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/), but the advanced components also stand on their own and can be fully customized to meet the needs of any design system.

MUI X is **open-core**: [Community](#community-plan) components are MIT-licensed and free forever, while more advanced features and components require a [Pro](#pro-plan) or [Premium](#premium-plan) commercial license.
See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.

## Documentation

- [Date and Time Pickers](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/)
- [Charts](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/)
- [Tree View](https://mui.com/x/react-tree-view/)

### Installation

- [Data Grid installation](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/quickstart/#installation)
- [Date and Time Pickers installation](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/quickstart/#installation)
- [Charts installation](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/quickstart/#installation)
- [Tree View installation](https://mui.com/x/react-tree-view/quickstart/#installation)

## Licensing

The MUI X team has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, starting with Material UI, and we&#039;re committed to the continued advancement of our open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
Learn more about [our stewardship ethos](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced components and features that can&#039;t reasonably be maintained by the open-source community alone.
These licenses make it possible for us to support a full-time staff of engineers.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it&#039;s only because we believe you won&#039;t find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

### Plans

#### Community plan

The free Community version of MUI X contains components and features that we believe are maintainable by contributions from the open-source community.
It&#039;s published under an [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and it&#039;s [free forever](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd#20f609acab4441cf9346614119fbbac1).

## ⚡ Quick start

Latitude offers two deployment options:

1. **Latitude Cloud**: A fully managed solution that allows you to get started quickly without worrying about infrastructure.
2. **Latitude Self-Hosted**: An open-source version that you can deploy and manage on your own infrastructure for complete control and customization.

Choose the option that best fits your needs and follow the corresponding instructions below.

### Latitude Cloud

To get started with Latitude, follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for Latitude**: Visit our [website](https://latitude.so) and follow the instructions to create your account.

2. **Create a new project**: Once logged in, create a new project to organize your prompts and evaluations.

3. **Write your first prompt**: Navigate to the Editor and create a new prompt. Start with a simple task, like generating a short story or answering a question.

4. **Test your prompt**: Use the playground to test your prompt with different inputs and see the model&#039;s responses.

5. **Evaluate in batch**: Before deploying, you can upload a dataset and run a batch evaluation to assess your prompt&#039;s performance across various scenarios.

6. **Deploy your prompt**: Once you&#039;re satisfied with your prompt&#039;s performance in batch evaluation, deploy it as an endpoint for easy integration with your applications.

7. **Monitor and evaluate**: Use the Logs section to review your prompt&#039;s performance over time. Set up ongoing evaluations to systematically assess and improve your prompt&#039;s output.

8. **Iterate and improve**: Based on the evaluation results, refine your prompt or create new versions to enhance its performance.

9. **Collaborate with your team**: Invite team members to your Latitude workspace to collaborate on prompt engineering and evaluations.

## About

&lt;!-- &lt;Main description&gt;   --&gt;

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.

&gt; Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.

Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.
But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.&lt;br/&gt;
Mermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams. It can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Mermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed diagrams through the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).&lt;br/&gt;
For video tutorials, visit our [Tutorials](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/tutorials.html) page.
Use Mermaid with your favorite applications, check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/integrations-community.html).

You can also use Mermaid within [GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) as well many of your other favorite applications—check out the list of [Integrations and Usages of Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/integrations-community.html).

For a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and some of its more basic uses, look to the [Beginner&#039;s Guide](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/getting-started.html), [Usage](https://mermaid.js.org/config/usage.html) and [Tutorials](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/tutorials.html).

Our PR Visual Regression Testing is powered by [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/?utm_source=mermaid&amp;utm_campaign=oss) with their generous Open Source plan. It makes the process of reviewing PRs with visual changes a breeze.

[![Covered by Argos Visual Testing](https://argos-ci.com/badge-large.svg)](https://argos-ci.com?utm_source=mermaid&amp;utm_campaign=oss)

&gt; Fluent UI React is shipping its v9 final stable release. Visit the [Fluent UI React v9 Release page on the wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Fluent-UI-React-v9-Release) to learn more about the upcoming release schedule.

Fluent UI web represents a collection of utilities, React components, and Web Components for building web applications.

This repo is home to 3 separate projects today. Combining Fluent UI React v9 components with Fluent UI React v8 or v0 components is possible and allows gradual migration to Fluent UI v9.

The following table will help you navigate the 3 projects and understand their differences.

## Looking for Office UI Fabric React?

The **Office UI Fabric React** project has evolved to **Fluent UI**.

The `office-ui-fabric-react` repo is now this repo (`fluentui` in the Microsoft organization)! The name change should not disrupt any current Fabric usage, repo clones, pull requests, or issue reporting. Links should redirect to the new location. The library formerly known as `office-ui-fabric-react` is now available as `@fluentui/react` (see above table for more information).

We have a lot in store for Fluent UI - [Read our announcement here.](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/)

## Looking for Fluent UI React Northstar?

Fluent UI React Northstar has been superseded by Fluent UI React Components v9. For more details about Fluent UI React Northstar, see its [README.md](/packages/fluentui/README.md).

## Installation

To install Zettlr, just [download the latest release](https://www.zettlr.com/download/) for your operating system. Currently supported are macOS, Windows, and most Linux distributions (via Debian- and Fedora-packages as well as AppImages).

On our website and here on GitHub, we provide a set of installers for the most common use-cases. We provide both 64-bit installers as well as installers for ARM systems (called &quot;Apple Silicon&quot; in the macOS ecosystem). 32-bit is not supported. We offer the following binaries directly:

* macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
* Windows (x64)
* Debian/Ubuntu (x64 and ARM) 
* Fedora/Red Hat (x64 and ARM)
* AppImage (x64 and ARM)

Thanks to our community, we can also offer you a variety of other installation opportunities:

* [Homebrew (macOS)](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zettlr)
* [Aptitude (Ubuntu/Debian)](https://apt.zettlr.com)
* [Flathub (Linux)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.zettlr.Zettlr)
* [Chocolatey (Windows)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zettlr/)
* [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zettlr)

All other [platforms that Electron supports](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/build-instructions-gn#platform-prerequisites) are supported as well, but you will need to build the app yourself for this to work.

**Please also consider [becoming a patron](https://www.patreon.com/zettlr) or making a [one-time donation](https://paypal.me/hendrikerz)!**

## Getting Started

After you have installed Zettlr, [head over to our documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/) to get to know Zettlr. Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/5-minutes/), if you prefer to use software heads-on.

## Contributing

As an Open Source application, Zettlr always welcomes contributions from the community. **You do not need to know how to write code to help!** A full overview over all the areas where you can help can be found in our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Here, we introduce you to the two biggest areas where we welcome help: translations and contributing code.

### Translating

The development team maintains the English and German translations, but lacks adequate knowledge of other languages. All the other available translations have been created by our community.

Zettlr&#039;s translations utilize the [gettext system](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). This means that the translations are kept in PO-files within the [`static/lang` directory](./static/lang).

To update a translation, simply download the corresponding language file and edit it. You can edit PO-files with a simple text editor, but if you prefer a more comfortable graphical editor, there are many out there. One good option is the Open Source editor [POedit](https://poedit.net/).

As soon as you are happy with your changes, open a Pull Request here that updates the corresponding file. GitHub has created a great [guide on how to open Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository).

### Contributing Code

Zettlr is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based app, so to start developing, you&#039;ll need to have the following installed on your computer:

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure it&#039;s at least Node 20 (`lts/iron`). To test what version you have, run `node -v`.
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). This is the package manager for the project, as we do not commit `package-lock.json`-files and many commands require yarn. You can install this globally using `npm install -g yarn` or Homebrew, if you are on macOS.
3. On Windows, we recommend to [install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which will make many of the next steps easier.
4. A few command-line utilities that various scripts require for running the development builds:
    * [`cURL`](https://curl.se/download.html) (required by the Pandoc download script)
    * `unzip` (required by the Pandoc download script)
    * [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (required by the i18n script)
5. An appropriate build toolchain for your operating system, since Zettlr requires a few native C++-modules that must be compiled before running the app:
    * **macOS**: On macOS, installing the XCode command-line tools via `xcode-select --install` suffices
    * **Windows**: On Windows, you&#039;ll need the [free Visual Studio development tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) that include the required tools
    * **Linux**: On Linux, there are a variety of compatible toolchains available, sometimes they are already preinstalled. Refer to your distribution&#039;s manual for more information.

Then, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies on your local computer:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr.git
$ cd Zettlr
$ yarn install --immutable
```

The `--immutable` flag ensures that yarn will stick to the versions as listed in the `yarn.lock` and not attempt to update them.

During development, hot module reloading (HMR) is active so that you can edit the renderer&#039;s code easily and hit `F5` after the changes have been compiled by `electron-forge`. You can keep the developer tools open to see when HMR has finished loading your changes.

### What Should I Know To Contribute Code?

In order to provide code, you should have basic familiarity with the following topics and/or manuals (ordered by descending importance):

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (especially asynchronous code) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs)
* [Vue.js 3.x](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
* [CodeMirror 6.x](https://codemirror.net/docs/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/#)
* [Webpack 5.x](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [Electron forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)
* [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; See the &quot;Directory Structure&quot; section below to get an idea of how Zettlr specifically works.

### Development Commands

This section lists all available commands that you can use during application development. These are defined within the `package.json` and can be run from the command line by prefixing them with `yarn`. Run them from within the base directory of the repository.

#### `start`

Use this command to carefree test any changes you make to the application. This command will start the application, but will provide a custom configuration and a custom directory. Thus, it will not touch any files that a regular Zettlr installation will use.

**The first time you start this command**, pass the `--clean`-flag to copy a bunch of test-files to your `./resources`-directory, create a `test-config.yml` in your project root, and start the application with this clean configuration. Then, you can adapt the `test-config.yml` to your liking (so that certain settings which you would otherwise _always_ set will be pre-set without you having to open the preferences).

Whenever you want to reset the test directory to its initial state (or you removed the directory, or cloned the whole project anew), pass the flag `--clean` to the command in order to create or reset the directory. **This is also necessary if you changed something in `test-config.yml`**.

If you want to prevent a config-file from being created (e.g., to simulate the first start experience), you can pass the flag `--no-config` to this command.

You can pass additional command-line switches such as `--clear-cache` to this command as well. They will be passed to the child process.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Attention: Before first running the command, you **must** run it with the `--clean`-flag to create the directory in the first place!

Additionally, have a look at our [full development documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/get-involved).

#### `package`

Packages the application, but not bundle it into an installer. Without any suffix, this command will package the application for your current platform and architecture. To create specific packages (may require running on the corresponding platform), the following suffixes are available:

- `package:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)
- `package:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)
- `package:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)
- `package:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)
- `package:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)

The resulting application packages are stored in `./out`.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This command will skip typechecking to speed up builds, so we recommend running `lint` before packaging to ensure that there are no errors.

#### `release:{platform-arch}`

Packages the application and then bundles it into an installer for the corresponding platform and architecture. To create such a bundle (may require running on the corresponding platform), one of the following values for `{platform-arch}` is required:

- `release:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)
- `release:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)
- `release:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)
- `release:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)
- `release:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)

The resulting setup bundles are stored in `./release`.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; While you can `package` directly for your platform without any suffix, you need to specify the platform and architecture when creating a release bundle, since electron-builder would otherwise include the development-dependencies in the `app.asar`, resulting in a bloated application.

#### `csl:refresh`

This downloads the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) (CSL) files with which the application is shipped, and places them in the `static/csl-locales`- and `static/csl-styles`-directories respectively.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This command is intended for an automated workflow that runs from time to time on the repository to perform this action. **Do not commit updated files to the repository**. Instead, the updated files will be downloaded whenever you `git fetch`.

#### `lint:code`

Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) over the codebase. Apps such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will automatically run ESLint in the background on your open files. This command runs it across the entire code base.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Usually, you will want to run the `lint` command instead.

#### `lint:types`

Runs TypeScript&#039;s type checker via [`vue-tsc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-tsc) over the codebase. Apps such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will automatically check types for your open files in the background. This command checks the entire code base.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Usually, you will want to run the `lint` command instead.

#### `lint`

Runs both `lint:code` and `lint:types` in one go. This ensures that any code you add conforms to stylistic rules and can run without obvious errors. Make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This command will run automatically on each Pull Request to check your code for inconsistencies.

#### `lint:po`

This command ensures all translation files in the directory `static/lang` can be parsed by the app. It does so by parsing them with the `gettext` parser that ships with Zettlr. This command does not require the `gettext` system itself to be installed on the machine, as it only uses the Node module.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This command will run automatically on pull requests that touch `*.po`-files.

#### `shortcut:install`

Creates a `.desktop`-file into your applications which enables you to quickly start an app that you have compiled from source. This requires Linux. To use new changes, simple sync the repository, run `package` again, and you&#039;re good to go.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; We provide this command as a convenience. Unless you know what you are doing, you should not run code directly compiled from the HEAD commit of the develop branch. This command *can* be useful, however, in a few instances where you know what may go wrong and can take appropriate precautions.

### `shortcut:uninstall`

Removes the `.desktop`-file created by `shortcut:install`.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; You don&#039;t have to uninstall and reinstall the shortcut whenever you compile the binary anew. Just make sure that Zettlr is closed before you recompile it. You should only have to reinstall the shortcut if the template (in `scripts/assets/zettlr-dev.desktop`) has changed.

#### `test`

This runs the unit tests in the directory `./test`. Make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request, as this will be run every time you commit to the PR, and this way you can make sure that your changes don&#039;t break any tests, making the whole PR-process easier.

#### `test-gui`

See `start`.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This command is deprecated and only an alias for `start`. Use `start` instead.

### Directory Structure

Zettlr is a mature app that has amassed hundreds of directories over the course of its development. Since it is hard to contribute to an application without any guidance, we have compiled a short description of the directories with how they interrelate.

### On the Distinction between Modules and Service Providers

You&#039;ll notice that Zettlr contains both &quot;modules&quot; and &quot;service providers&quot;. The difference between the two is simple: Service providers run in the main process and are completely autonomous while providing functionality to the app as a whole. Modules, on the other hand, provide functionality that must be triggered by user actions (e.g. the exporter and the importer).

### The Application Lifecycle

Whenever you run Zettlr, the following steps will be executed:

0. Execute `source/main.ts`
1. Environment check (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)
2. Boot service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)
3. Boot main application (`source

  Ionic is an open source app development toolkit for building modern, fast, top-quality cross-platform native and Progressive Web Apps from a single codebase with JavaScript and the Web.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  Ionic is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction&quot;&gt;Web Components&lt;/a&gt;, which enables significant performance, usability, and feature improvements alongside support for popular web frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io/&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.com/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;.

[//]: # &#039;Welcome to Plate, a rich-text editor framework designed for simplicity and efficiency. Plate consists of four main parts:&#039;
[//]: #
[//]: # &quot;1. **Core**: This is the heart of Plate. It&#039;s a special plugin system just for `slate-react`. We&#039;ve made sure everything is neat and tidy, so it&#039;s easier for you to develop your project.&quot;
[//]: # &#039;2. **Plugins**: We give you a big selection of plugin packages. They help make editor behaviors, hooks, serialization, and normalization better, among other things.&#039;
[//]: # &#039;3. **Primitives**: Besides the headless plugins, we also provide primitive hooks and components built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/). These are **unstyled** and accessible parts for making great design systems.&#039;
[//]: # &#039;4. **Components**: We know a good-looking start is important. So, we give you components created with Plate CLI and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Use these as a starting point to create your own component library.&#039;

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40leonardsellem%2Fn8n-mcp-server.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40leonardsellem%2Fn8n-mcp-server)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants to interact with n8n workflows through natural language.

## Overview

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that empowers AI assistants to seamlessly interact with n8n, a popular workflow automation tool. It acts as a bridge, enabling AI assistants to programmatically manage and control n8n workflows and executions using natural language commands.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- n8n instance with API access enabled

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server
```

### Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server.git
cd n8n-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Optional: Install globally
npm install -g .
```

### Docker Installation

You can also run the server using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server

# Run the container with your n8n API configuration
docker run -e N8N_API_URL=http://your-n8n:5678/api/v1 \
  -e N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key \
  -e N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME=username \
  -e N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD=password \
  leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server
```

## Updating the Server

How you update the server depends on how you initially installed it.

### 1. Installed globally via npm

If you installed the server using `npm install -g @leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server`:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Run the following command to get the latest version:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server@latest
    ```
3.  If the server is currently running (e.g., as a background process or service), you&#039;ll need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

### 2. Installed from source

If you cloned the repository and installed from source:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/n8n-mcp-server
    ```
3.  If you&#039;ve made any local changes to the code that you want to keep, consider stashing them (optional):
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```
    You can apply them later with `git stash pop`.
4.  Pull the latest changes from the repository (assuming you are on the `main` branch):
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
    If you are on a different branch, replace `main` with your branch name.
5.  Install or update any changed dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
6.  Rebuild the project to include the latest updates:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
7.  If you previously installed it globally from this source folder using `npm install -g .`, you might want to run this command again to update the global link:
    ```bash
    npm install -g .
    ```
8.  Restart the server.
    *   If you run the server directly using a command like `node build/index.js` in your AI assistant&#039;s MCP configuration, ensure the path is still correct. Using `npm install -g .` and then `n8n-mcp-server` as the command should keep this consistent.

### 3. Using Docker

If you are running the server using Docker:

1.  Pull the latest image from Docker Hub:
    ```bash
    docker pull leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server:latest
    ```
2.  Stop and remove your old container. You&#039;ll need your container&#039;s name or ID (you can find it using `docker ps`):
    ```bash
    docker stop &lt;your_container_name_or_id&gt;
    docker rm &lt;your_container_name_or_id&gt;
    ```
3.  Start a new container with the updated image. Use the same `docker run` command you used previously, including all your necessary environment variables (refer to the &quot;Docker Installation&quot; section for an example command). For instance:
    ```bash
    docker run -e N8N_API_URL=http://your-n8n:5678/api/v1 \
      -e N8N_API_KEY=your_n8n_api_key \
      -e N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME=username \
      -e N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD=password \
      leonardsellem/n8n-mcp-server:latest
    ```
    Ensure you use `:latest` or the specific version tag you intend to run.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the directory where you&#039;ll run the server, using `.env.example` as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `N8N_API_URL` | Full URL of the n8n API, including `/api/v1` | `http://localhost:5678/api/v1` |
| `N8N_API_KEY` | API key for authenticating with n8n | `n8n_api_...` |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME` | Username for webhook authentication (if using webhooks) | `username` |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD` | Password for webhook authentication | `password` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug logging (optional) | `true` or `false` |

### Generating an n8n API Key

1. Open your n8n instance in a browser
2. Go to Settings &gt; API &gt; API Keys
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
4. Copy the key to your `.env` file

## Usage

### Running the Server

From the installation directory:

```bash
n8n-mcp-server
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
n8n-mcp-server
```

### Integrating with AI Assistants

After building the server (`npm run build`), you need to configure your AI assistant (like VS Code with the Claude extension or the Claude Desktop app) to run it. This typically involves editing a JSON configuration file.

**Example Configuration (e.g., in VS Code `settings.json` or Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`):**

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    // Give your server a unique name
    &quot;n8n-local&quot;: {
      // Use &#039;node&#039; to execute the built JavaScript file
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,
      // Provide the *absolute path* to the built index.js file
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;/path/to/your/cloned/n8n-mcp-server/build/index.js&quot;
        // On Windows, use double backslashes:
        // &quot;C:\\path\\to\\your\\cloned\\n8n-mcp-server\\build\\index.js&quot;
      ],
      // Environment variables needed by the server
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;N8N_API_URL&quot;: &quot;http://your-n8n-instance:5678/api/v1&quot;, // Replace with your n8n URL
        &quot;N8N_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_N8N_API_KEY&quot;, // Replace with your key
        // Add webhook credentials only if you plan to use webhook tools
        // &quot;N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME&quot;: &quot;your_webhook_user&quot;,
        // &quot;N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD&quot;: &quot;your_webhook_password&quot;
      },
      // Ensure the server is enabled
      &quot;disabled&quot;: false,
      // Default autoApprove settings
      &quot;autoApprove&quot;: []
    }
    // ... other servers might be configured here
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

*   Replace `/path/to/your/cloned/n8n-mcp-server/` with the actual absolute path where you cloned and built the repository.
*   Use the correct path separator for your operating system (forward slashes `/` for macOS/Linux, double backslashes `\\` for Windows).
*   Ensure you provide the correct `N8N_API_URL` (including `/api/v1`) and `N8N_API_KEY`.
*   The server needs to be built (`npm run build`) before the assistant can run the `build/index.js` file.

## Available Tools

The server provides the following tools:

### Using Webhooks

This MCP server supports executing workflows through n8n webhooks. To use this functionality:

1. Create a webhook-triggered workflow in n8n.
2. Set up Basic Authentication on your webhook node.
3. Use the `run_webhook` tool to trigger the workflow, passing just the workflow name.

Example:
```javascript
const result = await useRunWebhook({
  workflowName: &quot;hello-world&quot;, // Will call &lt;n8n-url&gt;/webhook/hello-world
  data: {
    prompt: &quot;Hello from AI assistant!&quot;
  }
});
```

The webhook authentication is handled automatically using the `N8N_WEBHOOK_USERNAME` and `N8N_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD` environment variables.

### Workflow Management

- `workflow_list`: List all workflows
- `workflow_get`: Get details of a specific workflow
- `workflow_create`: Create a new workflow
- `workflow_update`: Update an existing workflow
- `workflow_delete`: Delete a workflow
- `workflow_activate`: Activate a workflow
- `workflow_deactivate`: Deactivate a workflow

### Execution Management

- `execution_run`: Execute a workflow via the API
- `run_webhook`: Execute a workflow via a webhook
- `execution_get`: Get details of a specific execution
