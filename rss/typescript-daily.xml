This is server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of [MCP Filesystem Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities .

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements

## Installation
First, ensure you&#039;ve downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Installing via Smithery

To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
```

### Option 2: Install trough npx
Just run this in terminal
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander setup
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 3: Add to claude_desktop_config by hand
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Mac, found at ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;desktop-commander&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 4: Checkout locally
1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run setup
```
Restart Claude if running

The setup command will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the server
- Configure Claude&#039;s desktop app
- Add MCP servers to Claude&#039;s config if needed

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes &lt;20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes &gt;20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
console.log(&quot;old message&quot;);
=======
console.log(&quot;new message&quot;);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Model Context Protocol Integration

This project extends the MCP Filesystem Server to enable:
- Local server support in Claude Desktop
- Full system command execution
- Process management
- File operations
- Code editing with search/replace blocks

Created as part of exploring Claude MCPs: https://youtube.com/live/TlbjFDbl5Us

## Testimonials

[![It&#039;s a life saver! I paid Claude + Cursor currently which I always feel it&#039;s kind of duplicated. This solves the problem ultimately. I am so happy. Thanks so much. Plus today Claude has added the web search support. With this MCP + Internet search, it writes the code with the latest updates. It&#039;s so good when Cursor doesn&#039;t work sometimes or all the fast requests are used.](testemonials/img.png) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg

)

[![This is the first comment I&#039;ve ever left on a youtube video, THANK YOU! I&#039;ve been struggling to update an old Flutter app in Cursor from an old pre null-safety version to a current version and implemented null-safety using Claude 3.7. I got most of the way but had critical BLE errors that I spent days trying to resolve with no luck. I tried Augment Code but it didn&#039;t get it either. I implemented your MCP in Claude desktop and was able to compare the old and new codebase fully, accounting for the updates in the code, and fix the issues in a couple of hours. A word of advice to people trying this, be sure to stage changes and commit when appropriate to be able to undo unwanted changes. Amazing!](testemonials/img_1.png)

)

[![Great! I just used Windsurf, bought license a week ago, for upgrading old fullstack socket project and it works many times good or ok but also many times runs away in cascade and have to revert all changes loosing hundereds of cascade tokens. In just a week down to less than 100 tokens and do not want to buy only 300 tokens for 10$. This Claude MCP ,bought claude Pro finally needed but wanted very good reason to also have next to ChatGPT, and now can code as much as I want not worrying about token cost.
Also this is much more than code editing it is much more thank you for great video!](testemonials/img_2.png)

[![it is a great tool, thank you, I like using it, as it gives claude an ability to do surgical edits, making it more like a human developer.](testemonials/img_3.png)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=Ugy4-exy166_Ma7TH-h4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=Ugy4-exy166_Ma7TH-h4AaABAg)

[![You sir are my hero. You&#039;ve pretty much summed up and described my experiences of late, much better than I could have. Cursor and Windsurf both had me frustrated to the point where I was almost yelling at my computer screen. Out of whimsy, I thought to myself why not just ask Claude directly, and haven&#039;t looked back since.
Claude first to keep my sanity in check, then if necessary, engage with other IDEs, frameworks, etc. I thought I was the only one, glad to see I&#039;m not lol.

## 🤝 Contributing

If you are eligible to use Follow, you are welcome to join the open source community to build together.

Before you start, make sure you have enabled [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Corepack makes sure you are using the correct version (`packageManager` field in `package.json`) for package manager when you run corresponding commands.

```sh
corepack enable
```

Install dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Develop in the browser

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Then the browser opens `https://app.follow.is/__debug_proxy`，you can access the online API environment to development and debugging.

### Develop in the electron

You need to fill in the required environment variables first.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://api.follow.is` and run:

```sh
pnpm run dev:electron
```

Since it is not very convenient to develop in Electron, the first way to develop and contribute is recommended at this stage.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you can&#039;t log in to the app, copy the `__Secure-better-auth.session_token` in the cookie from your browser into the app.

Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why would you read this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful.

The information in this repository is condensed. Ultimately, the key to succeeding in technical interviews is consistent practice and I don&#039;t want to bore you with too many words. I tell you the minimum you need to know on how to go about navigating the interview process, you go and practice and land your dream job.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

## How is this repository different?

There are many awesome books like &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

**TypeScript Services:**

- `pds`: &quot;Personal Data Server&quot;, hosting repo content for atproto accounts. Most implementation code in `packages/pds`, with runtime wrapper in `services/pds`. See [bluesky-social/pds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) for directions on self-hosting.
- `bsky`: AppView implementation of the `app.bsky.*` API endpoints. Running on main network at `api.bsky.app`. Most implementation code in `packages/bsky`, with runtime wrapper in `services/bsky`.

**Lexicons:** for both the `com.atproto.*` and `app.bsky.*` are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under `./lexicons/`. These are JSON files in the [Lexicon schema definition language](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon), similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI.

**Interoperability Test Data:** the language-neutral test files in `./interop-test-files/` may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly

The source code for the Bluesky Social client app (for web and mobile) can be found at [bluesky-social/social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app).

Go programming language source code is in [bluesky-social/indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo), including the BGS implementation.

## Developer Quickstart

We recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js installs. This project requires Node.js version 18. `pnpm` is used to manage the workspace of multiple packages. You can install it with `npm install --global pnpm`.

There is a Makefile which can help with basic development tasks:

```shell
# use existing nvm to install node 18 and pnpm
make nvm-setup

# pull dependencies and build all local packages
make deps
make build

# run the tests, using Docker services as needed
make test

# run a local PDS and AppView with fake test accounts and data
# (this requires a global installation of `jq` and `docker`)
make run-dev-env

# show all other commands
make help
```

## About AT Protocol

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (&quot;ATP&quot; or &quot;atproto&quot;) is a decentralized social media protocol, developed by [Bluesky PBC](https://bsky.social). Learn more at:

- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview) 👈 Best starting point
- [Github Discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions) 👈 Great place to ask questions
- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)
- [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

The Bluesky Social application encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol framework. The namespace for these &quot;Lexicons&quot; is `app.bsky.*`.

## Contributions

&gt; While we do accept contributions, we prioritize high quality issues and pull requests. Adhering to the below guidelines will ensure a more timely review.

**Rules:**

- We may not respond to your issue or PR.
- We may close an issue or PR without much feedback.
- We may lock discussions or contributions if our attention is getting DDOSed.
- We do not provide support for build issues.

**Guidelines:**

- Check for existing issues before filing a new one, please.
- Open an issue and give some time for discussion before submitting a PR.
- If submitting a PR that includes a lexicon change, please get sign off on the lexicon change _before_ doing the implementation.
- Issues are for bugs &amp; feature requests related to the TypeScript implementation of atproto and related services.
  - For high-level discussions, please use the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions).
  - For client issues, please use the relevant [social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app) repo.
- Stay away from PRs that:
  - Refactor large parts of the codebase
  - Add entirely new features without prior discussion
  - Change the tooling or frameworks used without prior discussion
  - Introduce new unnecessary dependencies

Remember, we serve a wide community of users. Our day-to-day involves us constantly asking &quot;which top priority is our top priority.&quot; If you submit well-written PRs that solve problems concisely, that&#039;s an awesome contribution. Otherwise, as much as we&#039;d love to accept your ideas and contributions, we really don&#039;t have the bandwidth.

## Are you a developer interested in building on atproto?

Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.

### Run with Docker Compose

#### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Docker
- Installation of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Create a local copy of this Git repository (clone)
- Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and populate it with your data (`cp .env.example .env`)

#### a. Run environment

Run the following command to start the Docker images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ghostfolio/ghostfolio):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### b. Build and run environment

Run the following commands to build and start the Docker images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.build.yml build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.build.yml up -d
```

#### Setup

1. Open http://localhost:3333 in your browser
1. Create a new user via _Get Started_ (this first user will get the role `ADMIN`)

#### Upgrade Version

1. Update the _Ghostfolio_ Docker image

   - Increase the version of the `ghostfolio/ghostfolio` Docker image in `docker/docker-compose.yml`
   - Run the following command if `ghostfolio:latest` is set:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml pull
     ```

1. Run the following command to start the new Docker image:

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

## Contribution

Better Auth is free and open source project licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md). You are free to do whatever you want with it.

You could help continuing its development by:

- [Contribute to the source code](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Suggest new features and report issues](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues)

## Security
If you discover a security vulnerability within Better Auth, please send an e-mail to security@better-auth.com.

All reports will be promptly addressed, and you&#039;ll be credited accordingly.

目前本项目的原始发布地址只有 [**GitHub**](https://github.com/lyswhut/lx-music-desktop/releases)，其他渠道均为第三方转载发布，与本项目无关！

为了提高使用门槛，本软件内的默认设置、UI 操作不以新手友好为目标，所以使用前建议先根据你的喜好浏览调整一遍软件设置，阅读一遍[音乐播放列表机制](https://lyswhut.github.io/lx-music-doc/desktop/faq/playlist)及[可用的鼠标、键盘快捷操作](https://lyswhut.github.io/lx-music-doc/desktop/faq/hotkey)。

### Scheme URL 支持

从 v1.17.0 起支持 Scheme URL，可以使用此功能在浏览器等场景下调用 LX Music，我们开发了一个[油猴脚本](https://github.com/lyswhut/lx-music-script#readme)配套使用。

脚本安装地址：[LX Music 辅助脚本](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/438148)。

若你想自己调用 LX Music，可以参考文档「[Scheme URL 支持](https://lyswhut.github.io/lx-music-doc/desktop/scheme-url)」部分。

### 数据同步服务

从 v2.2.0 起，我们发布了一个独立的[数据同步服务](https://github.com/lyswhut/lx-music-sync-server#readme)。如果你有服务器，可以将其部署到服务器上作为私人多端同步服务使用，详情看该项目说明。

### 开放 API 支持

从 v2.7.0 起支持开放 API 服务。启用该功能后，将会在本地启动一个 HTTP 服务，提供播放器相关的接口供第三方软件调用，详情看文档「[开放 API 服务](https://lyswhut.github.io/lx-music-doc/desktop/open-api)」部分。

### 数据存储目录

默认情况下，软件的数据存储在：

- Linux：`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lx-music-desktop` 或 `~/.config/lx-music-desktop`
- macOS：`~/Library/Application Support/lx-music-desktop`
- Windows：`%APPDATA%/lx-music-desktop`

在 Windows 平台上，若程序文件夹中存在 `portable` 文件夹，则自动使用此文件夹作为数据存储文件夹（适用于 v1.17.0 及以上版本）。

## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&amp;nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&amp;nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&amp;nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&amp;nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).
- 🔗&amp;nbsp;Shareable links (export to a readonly link you can share with others).

We&#039;ll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.

[![Stargazers repo roster for @nocodb/nocodb](http://reporoster.com/stars/nocodb/nocodb)](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/stargazers)

# Installation

## Docker with SQLite

```bash 
docker run -d \
  --name noco \
  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/nocodb:/usr/app/data/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  nocodb/nocodb:latest
  ```

## Docker with PG
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name noco \
  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/nocodb:/usr/app/data/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NC_DB=&quot;pg://host.docker.internal:5432?u=root&amp;p=password&amp;d=d1&quot; \
  -e NC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=&quot;569a1821-0a93-45e8-87ab-eb857f20a010&quot; \
  nocodb/nocodb:latest
```

## Nix

```
nix run github:nocodb/nocodb
```

## NixOS
To use NocoDB as a NixOS module, a flake.nix would be as follows:

```
{
  description = &quot;Bane&#039;s NixOS configuration&quot;;

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nocodb.url = &quot;github:nocodb/nocodb&quot;;
  };

  outputs = inputs@{ nixpkgs, nocodb, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix
          nocodb.nixosModules.nocodb

          {
            services.nocodb.enable = true;
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## Auto-upstall
Auto-upstall is a single command that sets up NocoDB on a server for production usage.
Behind the scenes it auto-generates docker-compose for you.

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) &lt;(mktemp)
```

Auto-upstall does the following: 🕊
- 🐳 Automatically installs all pre-requisites like docker, docker-compose
- 🚀 Automatically installs NocoDB with PostgreSQL, Redis, Minio, Traefik gateway using Docker Compose. 🐘 🗄️ 🌐
- 🔄 Automatically upgrades NocoDB to the latest version when you run the command again.
- 🔒 Automatically setups SSL and also renews it. Needs a domain or subdomain as input while installation.
&gt; install.nocodb.com/noco.sh script can be found [here in our github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocodb/nocodb/develop/docker-compose/1_Auto_Upstall/noco.sh)

# Why are we building this?

Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, abrupt price changes &amp; most importantly a glass ceiling on what&#039;s possible in the future.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases that is open source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on the internet.

### `5` [Multi-Model Service Provider Support][docs-feat-provider]

In the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services.

## How it works

Supabase is a combination of open source tools. We’re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn&#039;t exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.

**Architecture**

Supabase is a [hosted platform](https://supabase.com/dashboard). You can sign up and start using Supabase without installing anything.
You can also [self-host](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview) and [develop locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development).

![Architecture](apps/docs/public/img/supabase-architecture.svg)

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) is an Elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts, updates, and deletes using websockets. Realtime polls Postgres&#039; built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over websockets to authorized clients.
- [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/) is a web server that turns your PostgreSQL database directly into a RESTful API.
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue) is a JWT-based authentication API that simplifies user sign-ups, logins, and session management in your applications.
- [Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api) a RESTful API for managing files in S3, with Postgres handling permissions.
- [pg_graphql](http://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql/) a PostgreSQL extension that exposes a GraphQL API.
- [postgres-meta](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta) is a RESTful API for managing your Postgres, allowing you to fetch tables, add roles, and run queries, etc.
- [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) is a cloud-native API gateway.

#### Client libraries

Our approach for client libraries is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.

## Why Manifest?

80% of websites and apps only use the most basic backend features. Using over-engineered solutions lead to unnecessary costs and complexity.

Manifest keeps it simple, delivering only the essential backend features and smoothly integrating in your project like any other file in your codebase.

## Use cases

Manifest fits great in those type of projects:

- 🛠️ Rapid prototyping: POCs and MVPs
- 🧩 Micro services: notification, payment, logging, file services...
- 🏭 CRUD-heavy apps: mobile apps, directories, PIMs, E-shops
- 🌐 Headless CMS: dynamic corporate websites, portfolios, blogs...

## Getting started

Simply run this terminal command to add Manifest locally:

```bash
npx add-manifest@latest
```

&gt; [!NOTE]  
&gt; Manifest is currently in BETA, use it at your own risk. It is stable enough to power small projects, prototypes and MVPs but we do not recommend to use it on critical platforms.

### Project Structure

- torrent-client: We use libtorrent, a Python library, to manage torrent downloads
- src/renderer: the UI of the application
- src/main: all the logic rests here.

## Build from source

### Install Node.js

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Install Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for Node.js. If you haven&#039;t installed Yarn yet, you can do so by following the instructions on [yarnpkg.com](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

### Install Node Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the Node dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
cd hydra
yarn
```

### Install OpenSSL 1.1

[OpenSSL 1.1](https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_1_1w.exe) is required by libtorrent in Windows environments.

### Install Python 3.9

Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/).

### Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment variables

You&#039;ll need an SteamGridDB API Key in order to fetch the game icons on installation.

Once you have it, you can copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and put it on`STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY`.

## Running

Once you&#039;ve got all things set up, you can run the following command to start both the Electron process and the bittorrent client:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Build

### Build the bittorrent client

Build the bittorrent client by using this command:

```bash
python torrent-client/setup.py build
```

### Build the Electron application

Build the Electron application by using this command:

On Windows:

```bash
yarn build:win
```

On Linux:

```bash
yarn build:linux
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Pre-trained TensorFlow.js models

This repository hosts a set of pre-trained models that have been ported to
TensorFlow.js.

The models are hosted on NPM and unpkg so they can be used in any project out of the box. They can be used directly or used in a transfer learning
setting with TensorFlow.js.

To find out about APIs for models, look at the README in each of the respective
directories. In general, we try to hide tensors so the API can be used by
non-machine learning experts.

For those interested in contributing a model, please file a [GitHub issue on tfjs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues) to gauge
interest. We are trying to add models that complement the existing set of models
and can be used as building blocks in other apps.

## Development

You can run the unit tests for any of the models by running the following
inside a directory:

`yarn test`

New models should have a test NPM script (see [this](./mobilenet/package.json) `package.json` and `run_tests.ts` [helper](./mobilenet/run_tests.ts) for reference).

To run all of the tests, you can run the following command from the root of this
repo:

`yarn presubmit`

## FAQ

[English &gt; FAQ](./docs/faq-en.md)

## Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project with just one click following the steps above, you may encounter the issue of &quot;Updates Available&quot; constantly showing up. This is because Vercel will create a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, resulting in the inability to detect updates correctly.

We recommend that you follow the steps below to re-deploy:

- Delete the original repository;
- Use the fork button in the upper right corner of the page to fork this project;
- Choose and deploy in Vercel again, [please see the detailed tutorial](./docs/vercel-cn.md).

### Enable Automatic Updates

&gt; If you encounter a failure of Upstream Sync execution, please [manually update code](./README.md#manually-updating-code).

After forking the project, due to the limitations imposed by GitHub, you need to manually enable Workflows and Upstream Sync Action on the Actions page of the forked project. Once enabled, automatic updates will be scheduled every hour:

![Automatic Updates](./docs/images/enable-actions.jpg)

![Enable Automatic Updates](./docs/images/enable-actions-sync.jpg)

### Manually Updating Code

If you want to update instantly, you can check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to learn how to synchronize a forked project with upstream code.

You can star or watch this project or follow author to get release notifications in time.

## Access Password

This project provides limited access control. Please add an environment variable named `CODE` on the vercel environment variables page. The value should be passwords separated by comma like this:

```

## Requirements

NodeJS &gt;= 18, Docker &gt;= 20

## Development


[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web)

Before starting development, you must create a new `.env.local` file at project root, and place your api key into it:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your api key here&gt;

# if you are not able to access openai service, use this BASE_URL
BASE_URL=https://chatgpt1.nextweb.fun/api/proxy
```

### Local Development

```shell
# 1. install nodejs and yarn first
# 2. config local env vars in `.env.local`
# 3. run
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Deployment


### Docker (Recommended)

```shell
docker pull yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
   -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
   -e CODE=your-password \
   yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web
```

You can start service behind a proxy:

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
   -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
   -e CODE=your-password \
   -e PROXY_URL=http://localhost:7890 \
   yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web
```

If your proxy needs password, use:

```shell
-e PROXY_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:7890 user pass&quot;
```

If enable MCP, use：

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
   -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
   -e CODE=your-password \
   -e ENABLE_MCP=true \
   yidadaa/chatgpt-next-web
```

### Shell

```shell
bash &lt;(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/main/scripts/setup.sh)
```
