***Elegant reading of real-time and hottest news***

## Features
- Elegant design for a pleasant reading experience, keeping you up-to-date with the latest and hottest news.
- Supports Github login and data synchronization.
- Default cache duration is 30 minutes. Logged-in users can force fetch the latest data. However, the scraping interval is adjusted based on the update frequency of the content sources (as fast as every two minutes) to save resources and prevent frequent scraping that could lead to IP bans.

## Deployment

If login and caching are not required, you can directly deploy to platforms like Cloudflare Pages or Vercel. Just fork the repository and import it into the respective platform.

For Cloudflare Pages, you need to set the build command to `pnpm run build` and the build output directory to `dist/output/public`.

For login, which involves GitHub OAuth, you only need to [create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). No special permissions are required. The callback URL should be `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain).

After creating the app, you will get a Client ID and Client Secret. Different platforms have different places to set environment variables; refer to the `example.env.server` file. If running locally, rename it to `.env.server` and add the necessary values.

```env
# Github Client ID
G_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

This project primarily supports deployment on Cloudflare Pages and Docker. For Vercel, you need to set up your own database. Supported databases can be found at https://db0.unjs.io/connectors .

The Cloudflare D1 database can be used for free. To set it up, go to the Cloudflare Worker control panel and manually create a D1 database. Then, add the `database_id` and `database_name` to the corresponding fields in your `wrangler.toml` file.

If you don&#039;t have a `wrangler.toml` file, you can rename `example.wrangler.toml` to `wrangler.toml` and modify it with your configuration. The changes will take effect on your next deployment.

For Docker deployment. In the project root directory with `docker-compose.yml`, run

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Development

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Node version &gt;= 20

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

If you want to add data sources, refer to the `shared/sources`, and `server/sources` directories. The project has complete types and a simple structure; feel free to explore.

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements
  - vscode-ripgrep based recursive code or text search in folders

## Installation
First, ensure you&#039;ve downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Installing via Smithery

To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
```

### Option 2: Install trough npx
Just run this in terminal
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander setup
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 3: Add to claude_desktop_config by hand
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Mac, found at ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;desktop-commander&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 4: Checkout locally
1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run setup
```
Restart Claude if running

The setup command will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the server
- Configure Claude&#039;s desktop app
- Add MCP servers to Claude&#039;s config if needed

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata
- `code_search`: Recursive ripgrep based text and code search

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes &lt;20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes &gt;20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH
console.log(&quot;old message&quot;);
=======
console.log(&quot;new message&quot;);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Model Context Protocol Integration

This project extends the MCP Filesystem Server to enable:
- Local server support in Claude Desktop
- Full system command execution

## Testimonials

[![It&#039;s a life saver! I paid Claude + Cursor currently which I always feel it&#039;s kind of duplicated. This solves the problem ultimately. I am so happy. Thanks so much. Plus today Claude has added the web search support. With this MCP + Internet search, it writes the code with the latest updates. It&#039;s so good when Cursor doesn&#039;t work sometimes or all the fast requests are used.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img.png) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&amp;lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg

)

[![This is the first comment I&#039;ve ever left on a youtube video, THANK YOU! I&#039;ve been struggling to update an old Flutter app in Cursor from an old pre null-safety version to a current version and implemented null-safety using Claude 3.7. I got most of the way but had critical BLE errors that I spent days trying to resolve with no luck. I tried Augment Code but it didn&#039;t get it either. I implemented your MCP in Claude desktop and was able to compare the old and new codebase fully, accounting for the updates in the code, and fix the issues in a couple of hours. A word of advice to people trying this, be sure to stage changes and commit when appropriate to be able to undo unwanted changes. Amazing!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img_1.png)

)

[![Great! I just used Windsurf, bought license a week ago, for upgrading old fullstack socket project and it works many times good or ok but also many times runs away in cascade and have to revert all changes loosing hundereds of cascade tokens. In just a week down to less than 100 tokens and do not want to buy only 300 tokens for 10$. This Claude MCP ,bought claude Pro finally needed but wanted very good reason to also have next to ChatGPT, and now can code as much as I want not worrying about token cost.
Also this is much more than code editing it is much more thank you for great video!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img_2.png)

[![it is a great tool, thank you, I like using it, as it gives claude an ability to do surgical edits, making it more like a human developer.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img_3.png)

[![You sir are my hero. You&#039;ve pretty much summed up and described my experiences of late, much better than I could have. Cursor and Windsurf both had me frustrated to the point where I was almost yelling at my computer screen. Out of whimsy, I thought to myself why not just ask Claude directly, and haven&#039;t looked back since.
Claude first to keep my sanity in check, then if necessary, engage with other IDEs, frameworks, etc. I thought I was the only one, glad to see I&#039;m not lol.

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data-driven culture:

- **Visualizations:** Fast and flexible client side graphs with a multitude of options. Panel plugins offer many different ways to visualize metrics and logs.
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dynamic &amp; reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.
- **Explore Metrics:** Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.
- **Explore Logs:** Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live.
- **Alerting:** Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie.
- **Mixed Data Sources:** Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom datasources.

# 🔥 Firecrawl

Empower your AI apps with clean data from any website. Featuring advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities.

_This repository is in development, and we’re still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It&#039;s not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

&lt;/a&gt;

## How to use it?

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### Features

- [**Scrape**](#scraping): scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via [LLM Extract](#llm-extraction-beta), screenshot, html)
- [**Crawl**](#crawling): scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- [**Map**](#map-alpha): input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
- [**Extract**](#extract): get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.

### Powerful Capabilities
- **LLM-ready formats**: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
- **The hard stuff**: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- **Customizability**: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc...
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
- **Batching (New)**: scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint.

You can find all of Firecrawl&#039;s capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev)

### Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;limit&quot;: 10,
      &quot;scrapeOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
      }
    }&#039;
```

Returns a crawl job id and the url to check the status of the crawl.

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;123-456-789&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789&quot;
}
```

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789 \
  -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039;

    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot; : [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
    }&#039;
```

Response:

      &quot;statusCode&quot;: 200
    }
  }
}
```

### Map (Alpha)

Used to map a URL and get urls of the website. This returns most links present on the website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;
    }&#039;
```

Response:

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/playground&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/smart-crawl&quot;,
  ]
}
```

#### Map with search

Map with `search` param allows you to search for specific urls inside a website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;search&quot;: &quot;docs&quot;
    }&#039;
```

Response will be an ordered list from the most relevant to the least relevant.

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python&quot;,
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3&quot;,
  ]
}
```

### Extract

Get structured data from entire websites with a prompt and/or a schema.

You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards:

Single Page:
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/some-page

Multiple Pages / Full Domain
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/*

When you use /*, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/extract \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [
        &quot;https://firecrawl.dev/*&quot;, 
        &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;, 
        &quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/companies&quot;
      ],
      &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission, whether it is open source, and whether it is in Y Combinator from the page.&quot;,
      &quot;schema&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
        &quot;properties&quot;: {
          &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          }
        },
        &quot;required&quot;: [
          &quot;company_mission&quot;,
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
        ]
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;44aa536d-f1cb-4706-ab87-ed0386685740&quot;,
  &quot;urlTrace&quot;: []
}
```

If you are using the sdks, it will auto pull the response for you:

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl is the easiest way to extract data from the web. Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.&quot;,
    &quot;supports_sso&quot;: false,
    &quot;is_open_source&quot;: true,
    &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
  }
}
```

### LLM Extraction (Beta)

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.mendable.ai/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;json&quot;],
      &quot;jsonOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;schema&quot;: {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
          &quot;properties&quot;: {
            &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
            },
            &quot;supports_sso&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            },
            &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            },
            &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            }
          },
          &quot;required&quot;: [
            &quot;company_mission&quot;,
            &quot;supports_sso&quot;,
            &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
            &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
          ]
        }
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Raw Content&quot;,
    &quot;metadata&quot;: {
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide&quot;,
      &quot;robots&quot;: &quot;follow, index&quot;,
      &quot;ogTitle&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;ogDescription&quot;: &quot;Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide&quot;,
      &quot;ogUrl&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/&quot;,
      &quot;ogImage&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/mendable_new_og1.png&quot;,
      &quot;ogLocaleAlternate&quot;: [],
      &quot;ogSiteName&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;sourceURL&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/&quot;
    },
    &quot;json&quot;: {
      &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn&#039;t have to&quot;,
      &quot;supports_sso&quot;: true,
      &quot;is_open_source&quot;: false,
      &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Extracting without a schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;json&quot;],
      &quot;jsonOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission from the page.&quot;
      }
    }&#039;
```

### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;google.com&quot;,
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
        &quot;actions&quot;: [
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;textarea[title=\&quot;Search\&quot;]&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;write&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;firecrawl&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;press&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;ENTER&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;h3&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;screenshot&quot;}
        ]
    }&#039;
```

### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/batch/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;, &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview&quot;],
      &quot;formats&quot; : [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
    }&#039;
```

### Search

The search endpoint combines web search with Firecrawl’s scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: [&quot;markdown&quot;]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise it defaults to getting SERP results (url, title, description).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;query&quot;: &quot;What is Mendable?&quot;
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai&quot;,
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Mendable | AI for CX and Sales&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;AI for CX and Sales&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=&quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;)

# Scrape a website:
scrape_status = app.scrape_url(
  &#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, 
  params={&#039;formats&#039;: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;]}
)
print(scrape_status)

# Crawl a website:
crawl_status = app.crawl_url(
  &#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, 
  params={
    &#039;limit&#039;: 100, 
    &#039;scrapeOptions&#039;: {&#039;formats&#039;: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;]}
  },
  poll_interval=30
)
print(crawl_status)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python

from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=&quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;)

class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):
    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., max_items=5, description=&quot;Top 5 stories&quot;)

data = app.scrape_url(&#039;https://news.ycombinator.com&#039;, {
    &#039;formats&#039;: [&#039;json&#039;],
    &#039;jsonOptions&#039;: {
        &#039;schema&#039;: TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema()
    }
})
print(data[&quot;json&quot;])
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

```js
import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from &#039;@mendable/firecrawl-js&#039;;

const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: &quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;});

// Scrape a website
const scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:

```js
import FirecrawlApp from &quot;@mendable/firecrawl-js&quot;;
import { z } from &quot;zod&quot;;

const app = new FirecrawlApp({
  apiKey: &quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
});

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe(&quot;Top 5 stories on Hacker News&quot;),
});

const scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl(&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;, {
  jsonOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },
});

console.log(scrapeResult.data[&quot;json&quot;]);
```

## Open Source vs Cloud Offering

Firecrawl is open source available under the AGPL-3.0 license. 

To deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering. The cloud solution allows us to continuously innovate and maintain a high-quality, sustainable service for all users.

Firecrawl Cloud is available at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) and offers a range of features that are not available in the open source version:

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

We rely on your support to keep our libraries developed and maintained under an MIT License, just how we like it. For React Flow you can do that on the [React Flow Pro website](https://reactflow.dev/pro) and for both of our libraries you can do it through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/xyflow).

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to check out the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/learn) or [Svelte Flow](https://svelteflow.dev/learn) learn section. However if you want to get a sneak peek of how to install and use the libraries you can see it here: 

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Flow&lt;/strong&gt; basic usage&lt;/summary&gt;

  ### Installation
  
  ```sh
npm install @xyflow/react
  ```

  ### Basic usage
  ```jsx
import { useCallback } from &#039;react&#039;;
import {
  ReactFlow,
  MiniMap,
  Controls,
  Background,
  useNodesState,
  useEdgesState,
  addEdge,
} from &#039;@xyflow/react&#039;;

import &#039;@xyflow/react/dist/style.css&#039;;

const initialNodes = [
  { id: &#039;1&#039;, position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: &#039;1&#039; } },
  { id: &#039;2&#039;, position: { x: 0, y: 100 }, data: { label: &#039;2&#039; } },
];

const initialEdges = [{ id: &#039;e1-2&#039;, source: &#039;1&#039;, target: &#039;2&#039; }];

function Flow() {
  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  const onConnect = useCallback((params) =&gt; setEdges((eds) =&gt; addEdge(params, eds)), [setEdges]);

  return (
    &lt;ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
    &gt;
      &lt;MiniMap /&gt;
      &lt;Controls /&gt;
      &lt;Background /&gt;
    &lt;/ReactFlow&gt;
  );
}

export default Flow;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Svelte Flow&lt;/strong&gt; basic usage&lt;/summary&gt;

  ### Installation
  
  ```sh
npm install @xyflow/svelte
  ```

  ### Basic usage
  ```svelte
&lt;script lang=&quot;ts&quot;&gt;
  import { writable } from &#039;svelte/store&#039;;
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    Controls,
    Background,
    BackgroundVariant,
    MiniMap,
  } from &#039;@xyflow/svelte&#039;;

  import &#039;@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css&#039;
  
  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: &#039;1&#039;,
      type: &#039;input&#039;,
      data: { label: &#039;Input Node&#039; },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: &#039;2&#039;,
      type: &#039;custom&#039;,
      data: { label: &#039;Node&#039; },
      position: { x: 0, y: 150 }
    }
  ]);

  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: &#039;1-2&#039;,
      type: &#039;default&#039;,
      source: &#039;1&#039;,
      target: &#039;2&#039;,
      label: &#039;Edge Text&#039;
    }
  ]);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;SvelteFlow
  {nodes}
  {edges}
  fitView
  on:nodeclick={(event) =&gt; console.log(&#039;on node click&#039;, event)}
&gt;
  &lt;Controls /&gt;
  &lt;Background variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots} /&gt;
  &lt;MiniMap /&gt;
&lt;/SvelteFlow&gt;
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Releases 

For releasing packages we are using [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) in combination with the [changeset Github action](https://github.com/changesets/action). The rough idea is:

1. create PRs for new features, updates and fixes (with a changeset if relevant for changelog)
2. merge into main 
3. changset creates a PR that bumps all packages based on the changesets 
4. merge changeset PR if you want to release to Github and npm

# how it works?

- we record everything 24/7, 100% locally, uses 10% CPU, 4 GB ram, 15 gb/m
- we index it into an api
- dev build ai apps w user&#039;s full context, desktop native, nextjs, publish, monetize

&lt;img src=&quot;./content/diagram2.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da5b8583-550f-4a1f-b211-058e7869bc91&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;



# why?

- ai models are commoditized 
- ai is as good as its context
- the most valuable context is all contained in your screen


## get started

macos, linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL get.screenpi.pe/cli | sh
```

or on windows

```bash
iwr get.screenpi.pe/cli.ps1 | iex
```

then

```bash
screenpipe
```

make sure to allow permissions on macos (screen, mic)

- [get the desktop app](https://screenpi.pe/)
- [docs &amp; build from source](https://docs.screenpi.pe/docs/getting-started)

## create plugins

```bash
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe create
```

screenpipe has a plugin system called &quot;pipe&quot; which lets you create desktop app in nextjs in a sandboxed environment within our Rust code, [read more](https://docs.screenpi.pe/docs/plugins)

you can then publish these to our store and make money:

```bash
cd foo
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe register --name foo [--paid --price 50] # subscription
bun run build
bunx --bun @screenpipe/dev@latest pipe publish --name foo
```

## Getting started

See our [Getting Started Guide][getting-started] if you&#039;re building your first project with Angular
Material.


## Contributing

If you&#039;d like to contribute, please follow our [contributing guidelines][contributing]. Please see
our [`help wanted`][help-wanted] label for a list of issues with good opportunities for

## About the team
The Angular Components team is part of the Angular team at Google. The team includes both Google
employees and community contributors from around the globe.

Our team has two primary goals:
* Build high-quality UI components that developers can drop into existing applications
* Provide tools that help developers build their own custom components with common interaction
patterns


What do we mean by &quot;high-quality&quot; components?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don&#039;t confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular developers.

## Browser and screen reader support
The Angular Components team supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and  Edge.

We aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:
* **Windows**: NVDA and JAWS with FF / Chrome.
* **macOS**: VoiceOver with Safari / Chrome.
* **iOS**: VoiceOver with Safari
* **Android**: Android Accessibility Suite (formerly TalkBack) with Chrome.
* **Chrome OS**: ChromeVox with Chrome.

## ⚡ Introduction

By constructing sentences with conjunctions, it helps you learn English better~ 😊

## 🚀 How To Start?

**The mentioned operations below are based on the root directory of the current project, please be attentive to ensure there are no errors!**

### Requirements

- **pnpm version &gt;= 8**

  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```

- **Node.js version &gt;= v20**
  &gt; Use the version from .node-version. [Supported tools](https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage#compatibility-testing)
- **Postgres version &gt;= 14.0.0**
- **Redis version &gt;= 5.0.0**
- **Docker**. please make sure it is installed and running successfully on your local machine.

```bash
docker --version # Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b

node --version # v20+

pnpm -v # 8+
```

### Editor

#### VSCode

- Install the recommended extensions [extensions.json](./.vscode/extensions.json)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure the `.env` File

You can choose to copy the contents of `./apps/api/.env.example` to`./apps/api/.env`. note that the&#039; example&#039; file contains sample configuration. the main storage system&#039;s environment variable information, such as database connection address, user name, password, port, key, etc. the back-end service will read the configuration from this file, **of course you can also change it to your own configuration information**.

Windows users recommend shortcut keys to copy and paste, Linux users can operate through the following command.

#### Server

```bash
cp ./apps/api/.env.example ./apps/api/.env
```

#### Client

```bash
cp ./apps/client/.env.example ./apps/client/.env
```

### 3. Restore Data Of Logto

Uncompress `logto_db_init_data.zip` to `.volumes/`

```bash
unzip logto_db_init_data.zip -d .volumes/
```

- Admin URL: http://localhost:3011
- Username: admin
- Password: WkN7g5-i8ZrJckX

&gt; if you want to [Manual Configuration Logto](https://github.com/cuixueshe/earthworm/wiki/%E8%BF%81%E7%A7%BB-Logto-%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%90%8E%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%EF%BC%88%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE%E8%80%85%EF%BC%89)

### 4. Start Docker Compose Service

The backend relies on Postgres and Redis services. Start and stop these services using the commands configured in `package.json` below.

```bash
# start
pnpm docker:start

# When needed, execute the following command
# stop
pnpm docker:stop
# delete
pnpm docker:delete
# Complete deletion (including Volume data)
pnpm docker:down
```

If you prefer manual, you can use the commands below.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose stop
docker compose down

# commands compatible with older versions of Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Initialize Database Schema

When executing this command, try to keep a little time from the previous command, because the `-d` parameter just used will suspend its service execution in the background. At this time, the docker service may still be running. If an error is found, execute it again.

```bash
pnpm db:init
```

### 6. Create and Upload Course Data

**Only Execute This During the Initial Database Initialization**.

```bash
pnpm db:upload
```

### 7. Start the Backend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:serve
```

### 8. Start the Frontend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:client
```

## 🛠️ About testing

**Run the test before submitting the commit, and submit the code after the test passes, so as to avoid multiple commits to solve the test problem**.

### Front-end Testing

The main is the single test of Vitest and the automated test of cypress, execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter the front-end project directory
cd apps/client

# vitest
pnpm test:unit:run
# cypress
pnpm test:e2e:run

# monitor vitest, convenient hot update to see test results
pnpm test:unit:watch
```

### Backend Testing

Mainly Jest single test and end-to-end test, but need to access the test database, so you need to ensure that:

1. testdb and testRedis services in Docker Compose started normally.
2. The configuration information in the `.env.test` file is correct. If there is no such file, you can copy the contents of the `apps/api/.env.test.example` file to the `apps/api/.env.test` file. The following command is provided to directly use.

Execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter Backend Project Directory
cd apps/api

# If you have an.env.test file, you don&#039;t need to run this step
cp .env.test.example .env.test

# Single test
pnpm test:unit
# End-to-end testing
pnpm test:e2e
# Single test and end-to-end test run together
pnpm test
```

## Docs Project

Project based on Vitepress documentation，execute the following command:

```bash
# Local Development
pnpm docs:dev
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Database connection failed

My Docker and the database inside are running normally, but when I run the `db:init` command, I still report an error, indicating that the database connection failed.

You can check whether the database configuration in the `.env` file is correct, or even whether this file has it! 😠

### How To Correctly Update Course Data?

when you identify incorrect course data and make modifications, you should use the following command to update the course data in the database.

```bash
pnpm db:update
```

### pnpm Install Error?

Some dependencies require compilation during installation, necessitating the presence of relevant build environments.
If these environments are not available, the compilation process may fail. Additionally, different modules may require different build environments, so specific issues need to be analyzed individually.
Below are specific problems encountered along with their solutions.

First try the following command to update `pnpm`.

```shell
pnpm i -g
# or
pnpm i -g pnpm
# or
npx pnpm i -g pnpm@latest
```

**Error Installing the argon2 Module On Windows**

- Install Visual Studio 2015 or later, specifically the &quot;Desktop development with C++&quot; component. (In practice, any component containing C++ development tools and libraries will suffice.)
- If you encounter Chinese characters display issues during compilation, execute `chcp 437` in the command prompt, then rerun the install command.

### Docker Permission Denied in Docker?

When using WSL2 as a development environment in Windows, the following error occurs when starting Docker with `docker compose up -d` :

```bash
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get &quot;http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json&quot;: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

&gt; Solution

Add the current user to the docker group

```bash
# Add docker user group
sudo groupadd docker
# Add the logged-in user to the docker user group
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
# Update user group
newgrp docker
# Test if docker command is working properly
docker images
```

## 🤝 Frontend Development Guideline

1. Do not Destructure Pinia store.

   - The readability will be better when using `store`
   - Destructuring can lead to reactivity loss and using `storeToRefs` is also quite cumbersome

2. Avoid including UI logic in composables.

   - Such as `toast.info()`
   - We categorize the router as UI logic, and for ease of testing, avoid including routerrelated logic in there

## Intro

tRPC allows you to easily build &amp; consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

### Features

- ✅&amp;nbsp; Well-tested and production ready.
- 🧙‍♂️&amp;nbsp; Full static typesafety &amp; autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors.
- 🐎&amp;nbsp; Snappy DX - No code generation, run-time bloat, or build pipeline.
- 🍃&amp;nbsp; Light - tRPC has zero deps and a tiny client-side footprint.
- 🐻&amp;nbsp; Easy to add to your existing brownfield project.
- 🔋&amp;nbsp; Batteries included - React.js/Next.js/Express.js/Fastify adapters. _(But tRPC is not tied to React, and there are many [community adapters](https://trpc.io/docs/awesome-trpc#-extensions--community-add-ons) for other libraries)_
- 🥃&amp;nbsp; Subscriptions support.
- ⚡️&amp;nbsp; Request batching - requests made at the same time can be automatically combined into one
- 👀&amp;nbsp; Quite a few examples in the [./examples](./examples)-folder

## Quickstart

There are a few [examples](https://trpc.io/docs/example-apps) that you can use for playing out with tRPC or bootstrapping your new project. For example, if you want a Next.js app, you can use the full-stack Next.js example:

**Quick start with a full-stack Next.js example:**

```sh
# yarn
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# npm
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# pnpm
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# bun
bunx create-next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production.

## Quick start

&gt; Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
&gt;
&gt; - CPU &gt;= 2 Core
&gt; - RAM &gt;= 4 GiB

&lt;/br&gt;

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [docker compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

## Advanced Setup

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [.env.example](docker/.env.example) file and update the corresponding values in your `.env` file. Additionally, you might need to make adjustments to the `docker-compose.yaml` file itself, such as changing image versions, port mappings, or volume mounts, based on your specific deployment environment and requirements. After making any changes, please re-run `docker-compose up -d`. You can find the full list of available environment variables [here](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

If you&#039;d like to configure a highly-available setup, there are community-contributed [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/) and YAML files which allow Dify to be deployed on Kubernetes.

  生成 AI を安全に業務活用するための、ビジネスユースケース集を備えたアプリケーション実装

  &lt;img src=&quot;docs/assets/images/sc_lp.png&quot; alt=&quot;生成 AI を安全に業務活用するための、ビジネスユースケース集を備えたアプリケーション実装&quot; width=&quot;68%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; GenU は 2025/01 に v3 にアップグレードされました。いくつかの破壊的変更を伴いますので、アップグレード前に [リリースノート](https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-use-cases-jp/releases/tag/v3.0.0) をご確認ください。

## GenU 活用パターン集

GenU の機能やオプションを活用パターンごとに紹介いたします。網羅的なデプロイオプションに関しては [こちら](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md) をご参照ください。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 活用パターンをクリックして詳細を確認してください

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ins&gt;生成 AI のユースケースを体験したい&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  GenU は生成 AI を活用した多様なユースケースを標準で提供しています。それらのユースケースは、生成 AI を業務活用するためのアイデアの種となったり、そのまま業務で活用できるものなど、さまざまです。今後もさらにブラッシュアップされたユースケースを随時追加予定です。また、不要であれば [特定のユースケースを非表示にする](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#特定のユースケースを非表示にする) オプションで非表示にすることもできます。デフォルトで提供しているユースケース一覧はこちらです。

  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;ユースケース&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;説明&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;チャット&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;大規模言語モデル (LLM) とチャット形式で対話することができます。LLM と直接対話するプラットフォームが存在するおかげで、細かいユースケースや新しいユースケースに迅速に対応することができます。また、プロンプトエンジニアリングの検証用環境としても有効です。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;文章生成&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;あらゆるコンテキストで文章を生成することは LLM が最も得意とするタスクの 1 つです。記事・レポート・メールなど、あらゆる文章を生成します。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;要約&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;LLM は、大量の文章を要約するタスクを得意としています。ただ要約するだけでなく、文章をコンテキストとして与えた上で、必要な情報を対話形式で引き出すこともできます。例えば、契約書を読み込ませて「XXX の条件は？」「YYY の金額は？」といった情報を取得することが可能です。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;執筆&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;LLM は、誤字脱字のチェックだけでなく、文章の流れや内容を考慮したより客観的な視点から改善点を提案できます。人に見せる前に LLM に自分では気づかなかった点を客観的にチェックしてもらいクオリティを上げる効果が期待できます。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;翻訳&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;多言語で学習した LLM は、翻訳を行うことも可能です。また、ただ翻訳するだけではなく、カジュアルさ・対象層など様々な指定されたコンテキスト情報を翻訳に反映させることが可能です。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Web コンテンツ抽出&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ブログやドキュメントなどの Web コンテンツから必要な情報を抽出します。LLMによって不要な情報を除去し、整った文章として整形します。抽出したコンテンツは要約、翻訳などの別のユースケースで利用できます。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;画像生成&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;画像生成 AI は、テキストや画像を元に新しい画像を生成できます。アイデアを即座に可視化することができ、デザイン作業などの効率化を期待できます。こちらの機能では、プロンプトの作成を LLM に支援してもらうことができます。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;動画生成&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;動画生成 AI はテキストから短い動画を生成します。生成した動画は素材としてさまざまなシーンで活用できます。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;映像分析&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;マルチモーダルモデルによってテキストのみではなく、画像を入力することが可能になりました。こちらの機能では、映像の画像フレームとテキストを入力として LLM に分析を依頼します。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ダイアグラム生成&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ダイアグラム生成は、あらゆるトピックに関する文章や内容を最適な図を用いて視覚化します。 テキストベースで簡単に図を生成でき、プログラマーやデザイナーでなくても効率的にフローチャートなどの図を作成できます。&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ins&gt;RAG がしたい&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  RAG は LLM が苦手な最新の情報やドメイン知識を外部から伝えることで、本来なら回答できない内容にも答えられるようにする手法です。
  社内に蓄積された PDF, Word, Excel などのファイルが情報ソースになります。
  RAG は根拠に基づいた回答のみを許すため、LLM にありがちな「それっぽい間違った情報」を回答させないという効果もあります。

  GenU は RAG チャットというユースケースを提供しています。
  また RAG チャットの情報ソースとして [Amazon Kendra](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md) と [Knowledge Base](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#rag-チャット-knowledge-base-ユースケースの有効化) の 2 種類が利用可能です。
  Amazon Kendra を利用する場合は、[手動で作成した S3 Bucket や Kendra Index をそのまま利用する](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#既存の-amazon-kendra-index-を利用する場合)ことが可能です。
  Knowledge Base を利用する場合は、[Advanced Parsing](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#advanced-parsing-を有効化)・[チャンク戦略の選択](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#チャンク戦略を変更)・[クエリ分解](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#rag-チャット-knowledge-base-ユースケースの有効化)・[リランキング](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#rag-チャット-knowledge-base-ユースケースの有効化) など高度な RAG が利用可能です。
  また Knowledge Base では、[メタデータフィルターの設定](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#メタデータフィルターの設定) も可能です。
  例えば「組織ごとにアクセス可能なデータソースを切り替えたい」や「UI からユーザーがフィルタを設定したい」といった要件を満たすことが可能です。
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ins&gt;独自に作成した AI エージェントや Bedrock Flows などを社内で利用したい&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  GenU で [エージェントを有効化](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#agent-チャットユースケースの有効化)すると Web 検索エージェントと Code Interpreter エージェントが作成されます。
  Web 検索エージェントは、ユーザーの質問に回答するための情報を Web で検索し、回答します。例えば「AWS の GenU ってなに？」という質問に回答できます。
  Code Interpreter エージェントは、ユーザーからのリクエストに応えるためにコードが実行できます。例えば「適当なダミーデータで散布図を描いて」といったリクエストに応えられます。

  Web 検索エージェントと Code Interpreter エージェントはエージェントとしては基本的なものですので、中にはもっと業務に寄り添った実践的なエージェントを使いたいという要望もあると思います。
  GenU では手動で作成したエージェントや別のアセットで作成したエージェントを [インポートする機能](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#手動で作成した-agent-を追加) を提供しております。

  GenU をエージェント活用のプラットフォームとして利用することで、GenU が提供する [豊富なセキュリティオプション](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#セキュリティ関連設定) や [SAML認証](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#saml-認証) などを活用し、実践的なエージェントを社内に普及させることができます。
  また、オプションで [不要な標準ユースケースを非表示](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#特定のユースケースを非表示にする) にしたり、[エージェントをインライン表示](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#agent-をインライン表示にする) することで、よりエージェントに特化したプラットフォームとして GenU をご利用いただくことが可能です。

  Bedrock Flows に関しても同様に [インポート機能](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#flow-チャットユースケースの有効化) がございますので、ぜひご活用ください。
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ins&gt;独自のユースケースを作成したい&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

  GenU はプロンプトテンプレートを自然言語で記述することで独自のユースケースを作成できる「ユースケースビルダー」という機能を提供しています。
  プロンプトテンプレートだけで独自のユースケース画面が自動生成されるため、GenU 本体のコード変更は一切不要です。
  作成したユースケースは、個人利用だけではなく、アプリケーションにログインできる全ユーザーに共有することもできます。
  ユースケースビルダーは不要であれば[無効化](docs/DEPLOY_OPTION.md#ユースケースビルダーの設定)することも可能です。
  ユースケースビルダーについての詳細は、ぜひ&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/genu-use-cases-builder/&quot;&gt;こちらのブログ&lt;/a&gt;をご覧ください。
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  ユースケースビルダーではフォームにテキストを入力したりファイルを添付するユースケースが作成できますが、要件によってはチャットの UI が良い場合もあると思います。
  そのようなケースでは「チャット」ユースケースのシステムプロンプト保存機能をご活用ください。
  システムプロンプトを保存しておくことで、ワンクリックで業務に必要な &quot;ボット&quot; が作成できます。
  例えば「ソースコードを入力するとひたすらレビューしてくれるボット」や「入力した内容からひたすらメールアドレスを抽出してくれるボット」などが作成できます。
  また、チャットの会話履歴はログインユーザーにシェアすることが可能で、シェアされた会話履歴からシステムプロンプトをインポートすることもできます。
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  GenU は OSS ですので、カスタマイズして独自のユースケースを追加するということも可能です。
  その場合は GenU の main ブランチとのコンフリクトにお気をつけてください。
&lt;/details&gt;

## デプロイ

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; [`/packages/cdk/cdk.json`](/packages/cdk/cdk.json) に記載されている `modelRegion` リージョンの `modelIds` (テキスト生成) 及び `imageGenerationModelIds` (画像生成) を有効化してください。([Amazon Bedrock の Model access 画面](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/modelaccess))

GenU のデプロイには [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/cdk/)（以降 CDK）を利用します。CDK の実行環境が用意できない場合は、以下のデプロイ方法を参照してください。
- [AWS CloudShell を利用したデプロイ方法 (手元の環境を用意することが難しい場合)](docs/DEPLOY_ON_CLOUDSHELL.md)
- [Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/generative-ai-use-cases-jp)

まず、以下のコマンドを実行してください。全てのコマンドはリポジトリのルートで実行してください。

```bash
npm ci
```

CDK を利用したことがない場合、初回のみ [Bootstrap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html) 作業が必要です。すでに Bootstrap された環境では以下のコマンドは不要です。

```bash
npx -w packages/cdk cdk bootstrap
```

続いて、以下のコマンドで AWS リソースをデプロイします。デプロイが完了するまで、お待ちください（20 分程度かかる場合があります）。

```bash
# 通常デプロイ
npm run cdk:deploy

# 高速デプロイ (作成されるリソースを事前確認せずに素早くデプロイ)
npm run cdk:deploy:quick
```
