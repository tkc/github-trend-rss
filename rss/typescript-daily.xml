## 🎯 What is Shannon?

Shannon is an AI pentester that delivers actual exploits, not just alerts.

Shannon&#039;s goal is to break your web app before someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.

**What Problem Does Shannon Solve?**

Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a *massive* security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.

Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester. It doesn&#039;t just find potential issues. It executes real exploits, providing concrete proof of vulnerabilities. This lets you ship with confidence, knowing every build can be secured.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **From Autonomous Pentesting to Automated Compliance**
&gt;
&gt; Shannon is a core component of the **Keygraph Security and Compliance Platform**.
&gt;
&gt; While Shannon automates the critical task of penetration testing for your application, our broader platform automates your entire compliance journey—from evidence collection to audit readiness. We&#039;re building the &quot;Rippling for Cybersecurity,&quot; a single platform to manage your security posture and streamline compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and HIPAA.

## 🚀 Setup &amp; Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **AI Provider Credentials** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API key** (recommended) - Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
  - **Claude Code OAuth token**
  - **[EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Alternative providers via Router Mode** - OpenAI or Google Gemini via OpenRouter (see [Router Mode](#experimental---unsupported-router-mode-alternative-providers))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone Shannon
git clone https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon.git
cd shannon

# 2. Configure credentials (choose one method)

# Option A: Export environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;              # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN

# Option B: Create a .env file
cat &gt; .env &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
EOF

# 3. Run a pentest
./shannon start URL=https://your-app.com REPO=your-repo
```

Shannon will build the containers, start the workflow, and return a workflow ID. The pentest runs in the background.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# View real-time worker logs
./shannon logs

# Query a specific workflow&#039;s progress
./shannon query ID=shannon-1234567890

# Open the Temporal Web UI for detailed monitoring
open http://localhost:8233
```

### Stopping Shannon

```bash
# Stop all containers (preserves workflow data)
./shannon stop

# Full cleanup (removes all data)
./shannon stop CLEAN=true
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic pentest
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name

# With a configuration file
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name CONFIG=./configs/my-config.yaml

# Custom output directory
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name OUTPUT=./my-reports
```

### Prepare Your Repository

Shannon expects target repositories to be placed under the `./repos/` directory at the project root. The `REPO` flag refers to a folder name inside `./repos/`. Copy the repository you want to scan into `./repos/`, or clone it directly there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git ./repos/your-repo
```

**For monorepos:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-monorepo.git ./repos/your-monorepo
```

**For multi-repository applications** (e.g., separate frontend/backend):

```bash
mkdir ./repos/your-app
cd ./repos/your-app
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/api.git
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Linux (Native Docker):**

You may need to run commands with `sudo` depending on your Docker setup. If you encounter permission issues with output files, ensure your user has access to the Docker socket.

**For macOS:**

Works out of the box with Docker Desktop installed.

**Testing Local Applications:**

Docker containers cannot reach `localhost` on your host machine. Use `host.docker.internal` in place of `localhost`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 REPO=repo-name
```

### Configuration (Optional)

While you can run without a config file, creating one enables authenticated testing and customized analysis. Place your configuration files inside the `./configs/` directory — this folder is mounted into the Docker container automatically.

#### Create Configuration File

Copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
cp configs/example-config.yaml configs/my-app-config.yaml
```

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
authentication:
  login_type: form
  login_url: &quot;https://your-app.com/login&quot;
  credentials:
    username: &quot;test@example.com&quot;
    password: &quot;yourpassword&quot;
    totp_secret: &quot;LB2E2RX7XFHSTGCK&quot;  # Optional for 2FA

  login_flow:
    - &quot;Type $username into the email field&quot;
    - &quot;Type $password into the password field&quot;
    - &quot;Click the &#039;Sign In&#039; button&quot;

  success_condition:
    type: url_contains
    value: &quot;/dashboard&quot;

rules:
  avoid:
    - description: &quot;AI should avoid testing logout functionality&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/logout&quot;

  focus:
    - description: &quot;AI should emphasize testing API endpoints&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/api&quot;
```

#### TOTP Setup for 2FA

If your application uses two-factor authentication, simply add the TOTP secret to your config file. The AI will automatically generate the required codes during testing.

### [EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Router Mode (Alternative Providers)

Shannon can experimentally route requests through alternative AI providers using claude-code-router. This mode is not officially supported and is intended primarily for:

* **Model experimentation** — try Shannon with GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3–family models

#### Quick Setup

1. Add your provider API key to `.env`:

```bash
# Choose one provider:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Set default model:
ROUTER_DEFAULT=openai,gpt-5.2  # provider,model format
```

2. Run with `ROUTER=true`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name ROUTER=true
```

#### Experimental Models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-5.2, gpt-5-mini |
| OpenRouter | google/gemini-3-flash-preview |

#### Disclaimer

This feature is experimental and unsupported. Output quality depends heavily on the model. Shannon is built on top of the Anthropic Agent SDK and is optimized and primarily tested with Anthropic Claude models. Alternative providers may produce inconsistent results (including failing early phases like Recon) depending on the model and routing setup.

### Output and Results

All results are saved to `./audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/` by default. Use `--output &lt;path&gt;` to specify a custom directory.

Output structure:
```
audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/
├── session.json          # Metrics and session data
├── agents/               # Per-agent execution logs
├── prompts/              # Prompt snapshots for reproducibility
└── deliverables/
    └── comprehensive_security_assessment_report.md   # Final comprehensive security report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shannon emulates a human penetration tester&#039;s methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. It combines white-box source code analysis with black-box dynamic exploitation across four distinct phases:

### Architectural Overview

Shannon is engineered to emulate the methodology of a human penetration tester. It leverages Anthropic&#039;s Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of **white-box source code analysis** with the real-world validation of **black-box dynamic exploitation**, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.

---

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application&#039;s attack surface. Shannon analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.

#### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of **hypothesized exploitable paths** that are passed on for validation.

#### **Phase 3: Exploitation**

Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict **&quot;No Exploit, No Report&quot;** policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.

#### **Phase 4: Reporting**

The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with **reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts**, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.


## 📋 Coverage and Roadmap

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@every-env/compound-plugin)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@every-env/compound-plugin)

A Claude Code plugin marketplace featuring the **Compound Engineering Plugin** — tools that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Claude Code Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin install compound-engineering
```

## OpenCode + Codex (experimental) Install

This repo includes a Bun/TypeScript CLI that converts Claude Code plugins to OpenCode and Codex.

```bash
# convert the compound-engineering plugin into OpenCode format
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to opencode

# convert to Codex format
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to codex
```

Local dev:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts install ./plugins/compound-engineering --to opencode
```

OpenCode output is written to `~/.config/opencode` by default, with `opencode.json` at the root and `agents/`, `skills/`, and `plugins/` alongside it.
Both provider targets are experimental and may change as the formats evolve.
Codex output is written to `~/.codex/prompts` and `~/.codex/skills`, with each Claude command converted into both a prompt and a skill (the prompt instructs Codex to load the corresponding skill). Generated Codex skill descriptions are truncated to 1024 characters (Codex limit).

Sync your personal Claude Code config (`~/.claude/`) to OpenCode or Codex:

```bash
# Sync skills and MCP servers to OpenCode
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target opencode

# Sync to Codex
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target codex
```

This syncs:
- Personal skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (as symlinks)
- MCP servers from `~/.claude/settings.json`

Skills are symlinked (not copied) so changes in Claude Code are reflected immediately.

## Workflow

```
Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/workflows:plan` | Turn feature ideas into detailed implementation plans |
| `/workflows:work` | Execute plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review before merging |
| `/workflows:compound` | Document learnings to make future work easier |

Each cycle compounds: plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented.

## Philosophy

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder.**

Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. The codebase becomes harder to work with over time.

Compound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:
- Plan thoroughly before writing code
- Review to catch issues and capture learnings
- Codify knowledge so it&#039;s reusable
- Keep quality high so future changes are easy

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Dexter 🤖

Dexter is an autonomous financial research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data. Think Claude Code, but built specifically for financial research.

## 👋 Overview

Dexter takes complex financial questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using live market data, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.  

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

## ✅ Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.com) runtime (v1.0 or higher)
- OpenAI API key (get [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Financial Datasets API key (get [here](https://financialdatasets.ai))
- Exa API key (get [here](https://exa.ai)) - optional, for web search

#### Installing Bun

If you don&#039;t have Bun installed, you can install it using curl:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c &quot;irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex&quot;
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify Bun is installed:
```bash
bun --version
```

## 💻 How to Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/dexter.git
cd dexter
```

2. Install dependencies with Bun:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys (if using cloud providers)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key (optional)
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key (optional)
# XAI_API_KEY=your-xai-api-key (optional)
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key (optional)

# Institutional-grade market data for agents; AAPL, NVDA, MSFT are free
# FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key

# (Optional) If using Ollama locally
# OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434

# Web Search (Exa preferred, Tavily fallback)
# EXASEARCH_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key
# TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
```

## 🚀 How to Run

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
bun start
```

Or with watch mode for development:
```bash
bun dev
```

## 📊 How to Evaluate

Dexter includes an evaluation suite that tests the agent against a dataset of financial questions. Evals use LangSmith for tracking and an LLM-as-judge approach for scoring correctness.

**Run on all questions:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts
```

**Run on a random sample of data:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts --sample 10
```

The eval runner displays a real-time UI showing progress, current question, and running accuracy statistics. Results are logged to LangSmith for analysis.

## 🐛 How to Debug

Dexter logs all tool calls to a scratchpad file for debugging and history tracking. Each query creates a new JSONL file in `.dexter/scratchpad/`.

**Scratchpad location:**
```
.dexter/scratchpad/
├── 2026-01-30-111400_9a8f10723f79.jsonl
├── 2026-01-30-143022_a1b2c3d4e5f6.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each file contains newline-delimited JSON entries tracking:
- **init**: The original query
- **tool_result**: Each tool call with arguments, raw result, and LLM summary
- **thinking**: Agent reasoning steps

**Example scratchpad entry:**
```json
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;tool_result&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:&quot;2026-01-30T11:14:05.123Z&quot;,&quot;toolName&quot;:&quot;get_income_statements&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:{&quot;ticker&quot;:&quot;AAPL&quot;,&quot;period&quot;:&quot;annual&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:5},&quot;result&quot;:{...},&quot;llmSummary&quot;:&quot;Retrieved 5 years of Apple annual income statements showing revenue growth from $274B to $394B&quot;}
```

This makes it easy to inspect exactly what data the agent gathered and how it interpreted results.

# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge
of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We&#039;re using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That&#039;s where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.

![cal-star-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/154853944-a9e3c999-3da3-4048-b149-b4f73893c6fb.gif)

&lt;!-- GETTING STARTED --&gt;

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.

- Node.js (Version: &gt;=18.x)
- PostgreSQL (Version: &gt;=13.x)
- Yarn _(recommended)_

&gt; If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you may want to obtain additional credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below under the [integrations section](#integrations).

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). The code is licensed under [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE), which requires you to provide source code to users who interact with the software over a network. For commercial use without these requirements, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales)

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

   &gt; If you are on Windows, run the following command on `gitbash` with admin privileges: &lt;br&gt; &gt; `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git` &lt;br&gt;
   &gt; See [docs](https://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windows#enable-symbolic-links) for more details.

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Install packages with yarn

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 24` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.

5. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project&#039;s requirements as instructed by the docs, &quot;nvm&quot; (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install &amp;&amp; nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Quick start with `yarn dx`

&gt; - **Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed**
&gt; - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console

```sh
yarn dx
```

**Default credentials created:**

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `free@example.com` | `free` | Free user |
| `pro@example.com` | `pro` | Pro user |
| `trial@example.com` | `trial` | Trial user |
| `admin@example.com` | `ADMINadmin2022!` | Admin user |
| `onboarding@example.com` | `onboarding` | Onboarding incomplete |

You can use any of these credentials to sign in at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

&gt; **Tip**: To view the full list of seeded users and their details, run `yarn db-studio` and visit [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

#### Development tip

1. Add `export NODE_OPTIONS=“--max-old-space-size=16384”` to your shell script to increase the memory limit for the node process. Alternatively, you can run this in your terminal before running the app. Replace 16384 with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the node process.

2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` to your .env file to control the logging verbosity for all tRPC queries and mutations.\
   Where {level} can be one of the following:

   `0` for silly \
   `1` for trace \
   `2` for debug \
   `3` for info \
   `4` for warn \
   `5` for error \
   `6` for fatal

   When you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` in your .env file, it enables logging at that level and higher. Here&#039;s how it works:

   The logger will include all logs that are at the specified level or higher. For example: \

   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=2`, it will log from level 2 (debug) upwards, meaning levels 2 (debug), 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged. \
   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3`, it will log from level 3 (info) upwards, meaning levels 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged, but level 2 (debug) and level 1 (trace) will be ignored. \

```sh
echo &#039;NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3&#039; &gt;&gt; .env
```

for Logger level to be set at info, for example.

#### Gitpod Setup

1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.

2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)

#### Manual setup

1. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Replace `&lt;user&gt;`, `&lt;pass&gt;`, `&lt;db-host&gt;`, and `&lt;db-port&gt;` with their applicable values

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&#039;postgresql://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@&lt;db-host&gt;:&lt;db-port&gt;&#039;
   ```

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;If you don&#039;t know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB&lt;/summary&gt;

   1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install postgres in your local (if you don&#039;t have it already).

   2. Create your own local db by executing `createDB &lt;DB name&gt;`

   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d &lt;DB name&gt;`

   4. Inside the psql shell execute `\conninfo`. And you will get the following info.
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png)

   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this
      `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name`. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.

   &lt;/details&gt;

   If you don&#039;t want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app, Northflank or render.

   - [Setup postgres DB with railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql)
   - [Setup postgres DB with Northflank](https://northflank.com/guides/deploy-postgres-database-on-northflank)
   - [Setup postgres DB with render](https://render.com/docs/databases)

2. Copy and paste your `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` to `.env.appStore`.

3. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

4. Run [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to view emails sent during development

   &gt; **_NOTE:_** Required when `E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED` is &quot;1&quot;

   ```sh
   docker pull mailhog/mailhog
   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
   ```

5. Run (in development mode)

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

#### Setting up your first user

##### Approach 1

1. Open [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:

   ```sh
   yarn db-studio
   ```

1. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
1. Fill out the fields `email`, `username`, `password`, and set `metadata` to empty `{}` (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
   &gt; New users are set on a `TRIAL` plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` file.
1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.

##### Approach 2

Seed the local db by running

```sh
cd packages/prisma
yarn db-seed
```

The above command will populate the local db with dummy users.

### E2E-Testing

Be sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
# In a terminal just run:
yarn test-e2e

# To open the last HTML report run:
yarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report
```

#### Resolving issues

##### E2E test browsers not installed

Run `npx playwright install` to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running `yarn test-e2e`:

```
Executable doesn&#039;t exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

### Upgrading from earlier versions

1. Pull the current version:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

1. Apply database migrations by running &lt;b&gt;one of&lt;/b&gt; the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   (This can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Check for `.env` variables changes

   ```sh
   yarn predev
   ```

1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   For a production build, run for example:

   ```sh
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

1. Enjoy the new version.

## AI-Assisted Development

This repository includes configuration for AI coding assistants. All AI configuration lives in the `agents/` directory as a single source of truth.

### Structure

```
agents/
├── rules/           # Modular engineering rules
├── skills/          # Reusable skills/prompts
├── commands.md      # Command reference
└── knowledge-base.md # Domain knowledge

AGENTS.md            # Main agent instructions
```

### Tool Configuration

We use symlinks to share configuration across tools:

```
.claude/
├── rules -&gt; ../agents/rules
└── skills -&gt; ../agents/skills

.cursor/
├── rules -&gt; ../agents/rules
└── skills -&gt; ../agents/skills
```

### Using Other Tools

If you prefer other AI tools (Windsurf, Goose, OpenCode, etc.), you can create your own dot folders and exclude them from git:

```bash
# Add to .git/info/exclude (local only, not committed)
.windsurf/
.goose/
.opencode/
```

This keeps the repository clean while allowing personal tool preferences.

&lt;!-- DEPLOYMENT --&gt;

## Deployment

### Docker

**Official support**: Our team will begin to officially support the Dockerfile and docker-compose resources in this
repository.

**Important**: Cal.com will **not** be supporting installations that use these Docker resources. While we provide and maintain the Docker configurations, support for Docker-based installations is the responsibility of the user.

This image can be found on DockerHub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com).

**Note for ARM Users**: Use the {version}-arm suffix for pulling images. Example: `docker pull calcom/cal.com:v5.6.19-arm`.

#### Requirements

Make sure you have `docker` &amp; `docker compose` installed on the server / system. Both are installed by most docker utilities, including Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

Note: `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, per the Docker documentation.

#### (Most users) Running Cal.com with Docker Compose

If you are evaluating Cal.com or running with minimal to no modifications, this option is for you.

1. Clone calcom/cal.com

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

2. Change into the directory

   ```bash
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Prepare your configuration: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and then update `.env`

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Most configurations can be left as-is, but for configuration options see [Important Run-time variables](#important-run-time-variables) below.

   **Push Notifications (VAPID Keys)**
   If you see an error like:

   ```
   Error: No key set vapidDetails.publicKey
   ```

   This means your environment variables for Web Push are missing.
   You must generate and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`.

   Generate them with:

   ```bash
   npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
   ```

   Then update your `.env` file:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

   Do **not** commit real keys to `.env.example` — only placeholders.

   Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.

4. (optional) Pre-Pull the images by running the following command:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

   This will use the default image locations as specified by `image:` in the docker-compose.yaml file.

   Note: To aid with support, by default Scarf.sh is used as registry proxy for download metrics.

5. Start Cal.com via docker compose

   (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d calcom studio
   ```

   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d calcom

&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bluewavelabs.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Checkmate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open source uptime and infrastructure monitoring application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img width=&quot;1660&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b748f36d-a271-4965-ad0a-18bf153bbee7&quot; /&gt;

This repository contains both the frontend and the backend of Checkmate, an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations. Checkmate regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services&#039; availability, downtime, and response time.

Checkmate also has an agent, called [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture), to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insights about your servers&#039; CPU, RAM, disk, and temperature status. Capture can run on Linux, Windows, Mac, Raspberry Pi, or any device that can run Go.

Checkmate has been stress-tested with 1000+ active monitors without any particular issues or performance bottlenecks.

## Demo

You can see the latest build of [Checkmate](https://checkmate-demo.bluewavelabs.ca/) in action. The username is uptimedemo@demo.com and the password is Demouser1! (just a note that we update the demo server from time to time, so if it doesn&#039;t work for you, please ping us on the Discussions channel).

## User&#039;s guide

Usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.checkmate.so/checkmate-2.1). It&#039;s still WIP and some of the information there might be outdated as we continuously add features weekly. Rest assured, we are doing our best! :)

## Installation

See installation instructions in [Checkmate documentation portal](https://docs.checkmate.so/checkmate-2.1/users-guide/quickstart). 

Alternatively, you can also use [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/checkmate), [K8s](./charts/helm/checkmate/INSTALLATION.md), [Sive Host](https://sive.host) (South Africa) or [Pikapods](https://www.pikapods.com/) to quickly spin off a Checkmate instance. If you would like to monitor your server infrastructure, you&#039;ll need [Capture agent](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture). Capture repository also contains the installation instructions.

### Using a Custom CA

If you need to monitor internal HTTPS endpoints with certificates from private Certificate Authorities (like Smallstep), see our [Custom CA Trust Guide](./docs/custom-ca-trust.md) for Docker configuration options.

For more documentation, see the [docs directory](./docs/).


## Translations

If you would like to use Checkmate in your language, please [go to this page](https://poeditor.com/join/project/lRUoGZFCsJ) and register for the language you would like to translate Checkmate to. 

## Performance

Thanks to extensive optimizations, Checkmate operates with an exceptionally small memory footprint, requiring minimal memory and CPU resources. Here’s the memory usage of a Node.js instance running on a server that monitors 323 servers every minute:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e04a75-d83a-488f-b25c-025511b492c9)

You can see the memory footprint of MongoDB and Redis on the same server (398Mb and 15Mb) for the same amount of servers:

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (inline suggestions, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run a full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.

## Quick Start for Developers (Docker, Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run AiToEarn. It will start the **frontend, backend, MongoDB and Redis** with one command.  
You **do NOT** need to install MongoDB or Redis on your machine manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yikart/AiToEarn.git
cd AiToEarn
cp env.example .env
docker compose up -d
````


### 🌐 Access Applications

After Docker starts successfully, you can access services at:

| Service                 | URL                                            | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Frontend**        | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | Web user interface                                          |
| **Main Backend API**    | [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) | AiToEarn main server API                                    |
| **Channel Service API** | [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001) | AiToEarn channel service API                                |
| **MongoDB**             | localhost:27017                                | MongoDB (inside Docker, uses username/password from `.env`) |
| **Redis**               | localhost:6379                                 | Redis (inside Docker, uses password from `.env`)            |

&gt; ℹ️ MongoDB &amp; Redis are both started by `docker compose`.
&gt; You only need to configure their passwords in `.env`; no extra local installation is required.


### 🧩 Advanced Configuration (.env)

Edit the `.env` file to set secure values and customize your deployment:

```bash
# Required security configurations
MONGODB_PASSWORD=your-secure-mongodb-password
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-secure-redis-password
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token

# If external access is needed, set your public API/domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-domain.com:3002/api
APP_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
```

&gt; ✅ In production, please use strong, random passwords and secrets.



&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🧪 Optional: Run backend &amp; frontend manually (dev mode)&lt;/summary&gt;

This mode is mainly for local development &amp; debugging.
You can still use Docker for MongoDB/Redis or point to your own services via `.env`.

#### 1. Start the backend services

```bash
cd project/aitoearn-monorepo
pnpm install
npx nx serve aitoearn-channel
# in another terminal
npx nx serve aitoearn-server
```

#### 2. Start the frontend `aitoearn-web`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🖥️ Optional: Start Electron desktop project&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yikart/AttAiToEarn.git

# Enter directory
cd AttAiToEarn

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile sqlite (better-sqlite3 requires node-gyp and local Python)
npm run rebuild

# Start development
npm run dev
```

The Electron project provides a desktop client for AiToEarn.

&lt;/details&gt;

# Does the world need another CRM?

We built Twenty for three reasons:

**CRMs are too expensive, and users are trapped.** Companies use locked-in customer data to hike prices. It shouldn&#039;t be that way.

**A fresh start is required to build a better experience.** We can learn from past mistakes and craft a cohesive experience inspired by new UX patterns from tools like Notion, Airtable or Linear.

**We believe in Open-source and community.** Hundreds of developers are already building Twenty together. Once we have plugin capabilities, a whole ecosystem will grow around it.

&lt;br /&gt;

# What You Can Do With Twenty

&lt;/p&gt;

Oracle bundles your prompt and files so another AI can answer with real context. It speaks GPT-5.1 Pro (default alias to GPT-5.2 Pro on the API), GPT-5.1 Codex (API-only), GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and more—and it can ask one or multiple models in a single run. Browser automation is available; use `--browser-model-strategy current` to keep the active ChatGPT model (or `ignore` to skip the picker). API remains the most reliable path, and `--copy` is an easy manual fallback.

## Quick start

Install globally: `npm install -g @steipete/oracle`
Homebrew: `brew install steipete/tap/oracle`

Requires Node 22+. Or use `npx -y @steipete/oracle …` (or pnpx).

```bash
# Copy the bundle and paste into ChatGPT
npx -y @steipete/oracle --render --copy -p &quot;Review the TS data layer for schema drift&quot; --file &quot;src/**/*.ts,*/*.test.ts&quot;

# Minimal API run (expects OPENAI_API_KEY in your env)
npx -y @steipete/oracle -p &quot;Write a concise architecture note for the storage adapters&quot; --file src/storage/README.md

# Multi-model API run
npx -y @steipete/oracle -p &quot;Cross-check the data layer assumptions&quot; --models gpt-5.1-pro,gemini-3-pro --file &quot;src/**/*.ts&quot;

# Preview without spending tokens
npx -y @steipete/oracle --dry-run summary -p &quot;Check release notes&quot; --file docs/release-notes.md

# Browser run (no API key, will open ChatGPT)
npx -y @steipete/oracle --engine browser -p &quot;Walk through the UI smoke test&quot; --file &quot;src/**/*.ts&quot;

# Gemini browser mode (no API key; uses Chrome cookies from gemini.google.com)
npx -y @steipete/oracle --engine browser --model gemini-3-pro --prompt &quot;a cute robot holding a banana&quot; --generate-image out.jpg --aspect 1:1

# Sessions (list and replay)
npx -y @steipete/oracle status --hours 72
npx -y @steipete/oracle session &lt;id&gt; --render
npx -y @steipete/oracle restart &lt;id&gt;

# TUI (interactive, only for humans)
npx -y @steipete/oracle tui
```

Engine auto-picks API when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise browser; browser is stable on macOS and works on Linux and Windows. On Linux pass `--browser-chrome-path/--browser-cookie-path` if detection fails; on Windows prefer `--browser-manual-login` or inline cookies if decryption is blocked.

## Integration

**CLI**
- API mode expects API keys in your environment: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (GPT-5.x), `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Gemini 3 Pro), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Claude Sonnet 4.5 / Opus 4.1).
- Gemini browser mode uses Chrome cookies instead of an API key—just be logged into `gemini.google.com` in Chrome (no Python/venv required).
- If your Gemini account can’t access “Pro”, Oracle auto-falls back to a supported model for web runs (and logs the fallback in verbose mode).
- Prefer API mode or `--copy` + manual paste; browser automation is experimental.
- Browser support: stable on macOS; works on Linux (add `--browser-chrome-path/--browser-cookie-path` when needed) and Windows (manual-login or inline cookies recommended when app-bound cookies block decryption).
- Remote browser service: `oracle serve` on a signed-in host; clients use `--remote-host/--remote-token`.
- AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md:
  ```
  - Oracle bundles a prompt plus the right files so another AI (GPT 5 Pro + more) can answer. Use when stuck/bugs/reviewing.
  - Run `npx -y @steipete/oracle --help` once per session before first use.
  ```
- Tip: set `browser.chatgptUrl` in config (or `--chatgpt-url`) to a dedicated ChatGPT project folder so browser runs don’t clutter your main history.

**Codex skill**
- Copy the bundled skill from this repo to your Codex skills folder:
  - `mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills`
  - `cp -R skills/oracle ~/.codex/skills/oracle`
- Then reference it in your `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` so Codex loads it.

**MCP**
- Run the stdio server via `oracle-mcp`.
- Configure clients via [steipete/mcporter](https://github.com/steipete/mcporter) or `.mcp.json`; see [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) for connection examples.
```bash
npx -y @steipete/oracle oracle-mcp
```
- Cursor setup (MCP): drop a `.cursor/mcp.json` like below, then pick “oracle” in Cursor’s MCP sources. See https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp for UI steps.
[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=oracle&amp;config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBzdGVpcGV0ZS9vcmFjbGUgb3JhY2xlLW1jcCJ9)

```json
{
  &quot;oracle&quot;: {
    &quot;command&quot;: &quot;oracle-mcp&quot;,
    &quot;args&quot;: []
  }
}
```

## Highlights

- Bundle once, reuse anywhere (API or experimental browser).
- Multi-model API runs with aggregated cost/usage, including OpenRouter IDs alongside first-party models.
- Render/copy bundles for manual paste into ChatGPT when automation is blocked.
- GPT‑5 Pro API runs detach by default; reattach via `oracle session &lt;id&gt;` / `oracle status` or block with `--wait`.
- Azure endpoints supported via `--azure-endpoint/--azure-deployment/--azure-api-version` or `AZURE_OPENAI_*` envs.
- File safety: globs/excludes, size guards, `--files-report`.
- Sessions you can replay (`oracle status`, `oracle session &lt;id&gt; --render`).
- Session logs and bundles live in `~/.oracle/sessions` (override with `ORACLE_HOME_DIR`).

## Browser auto-reattach (long Pro runs)

When browser runs time out (common with long GPT‑5.x Pro responses), Oracle can keep polling the existing ChatGPT tab and capture the final answer without manual `oracle session &lt;id&gt;` commands.

Enable auto-reattach by setting a non-zero interval:
- `--browser-auto-reattach-delay` — wait before the first retry (e.g. `30s`)
- `--browser-auto-reattach-interval` — how often to retry (e.g. `2m`)
- `--browser-auto-reattach-timeout` — per-attempt budget (default `2m`)

```bash
oracle --engine browser \
  --browser-timeout 6m \
  --browser-auto-reattach-delay 30s \
  --browser-auto-reattach-interval 2m \
  --browser-auto-reattach-timeout 2m \
  -p &quot;Run the long UI audit&quot; --file &quot;src/**/*.ts&quot;
```

## Configuration

Put defaults in `~/.oracle/config.json` (JSON5). Example:
```json5
{
  model: &quot;gpt-5.1-pro&quot;,
  engine: &quot;api&quot;,
  filesReport: true,
  browser: {
    chatgptUrl: &quot;https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-691edc9fec088191b553a35093da1ea8-oracle/project&quot;
  }
}
```
Use `browser.chatgptUrl` (or the legacy alias `browser.url`) to target a specific ChatGPT workspace/folder for browser automation.
See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for precedence and full schema.
