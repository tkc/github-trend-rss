## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/images/diagram.png)

Suna consists of four main components:

### Backend API

Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration with Anthropic, and others via LiteLLM.

### Frontend

Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker

Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features.

### Supabase Database

Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

# Zero

An Open-Source Gmail Alternative for the Future of Email

## What is Zero?

Zero is an open-source AI email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to modernize and improve emails through AI agents to truly modernize emails.

## Why Zero?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**.
0.email is different:

- ✅ **Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, fully transparent.
- 🦾 **AI Driven** - Enhance your emails with Agents &amp; LLMs.
- 🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your emails, your data. Zero does not track, collect, or sell your data in any way. Please note: while we integrate with external services, the data passed through them is not under our control and falls under their respective privacy policies and terms of service.
- ⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own email app with ease.
- 📬 **Unified Inbox** – Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.
- 🎨 **Customizable UI &amp; Features** – Tailor your email experience the way you want it.
- 🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Tech Stack

Zero is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth
&lt;!-- - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library --&gt;

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Required Versions:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v10 or higher)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v20 or higher)

Before running the application, you&#039;ll need to set up services and configure environment variables. For more details on environment variables, see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

### Setup Options

You can set up Zero in two ways:

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standard Setup (Recommended)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

   ```

4. **Open in Browser**

   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   &lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Devcontainer Setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

#### Quick Start guide

1. **Clone and Install**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Mail-0/Zero.git
   cd Zero
   ```

   Then open the code in devcontainer and install the dependencies:

   ```
   pnpm install

   # Start the database locally
   pnpm docker:db:up
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**

   - Run `pnpm nizzy env` to setup your environment variables
   - Run `pnpm nizzy sync` to sync your environment variables and types
   - Start the database with the provided docker compose setup: `pnpm docker:db:up`
   - Initialize the database: `pnpm db:push`

3. **Start The App**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
     &lt;/details&gt;

### Environment Setup

1. **Better Auth Setup**

   - Open the `.env` file and change the BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to a random string. (Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a 32 character string)

     ```env
     BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
     ```

2. **Google OAuth Setup** (Required for Gmail integration)

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Add the following APIs in your Google Cloud Project: [People API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com), [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
     - Use the links above and click &#039;Enable&#039; or
     - Go to &#039;APIs and Services&#039; &gt; &#039;Enable APIs and Services&#039; &gt; Search for &#039;Google People API&#039; and click &#039;Enable&#039;
     - Go to &#039;APIs and Services&#039; &gt; &#039;Enable APIs and Services&#039; &gt; Search for &#039;Gmail API&#039; and click &#039;Enable&#039;
   - Enable the Google OAuth2 API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - Development:
       - `http://localhost:8787/api/auth/callback/google`
     - Production:
       - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Add to `.env`:

     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     ```

   - Add yourself as a test user:

     - Go to [`Audience`](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)
     - Under &#039;Test users&#039; click &#039;Add Users&#039;
     - Add your email and click &#039;Save&#039;

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console must match **exactly** what you configure in the `.env`, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and path - these are provided above.

3. **Autumn Setup** (Required for some encryption)

   -Go to [Autumn](https://useautumn.com/)
   -For Local Use, click [onboarding](https://app.useautumn.com/sandbox/onboarding) button and generate an Autumn Secret Key
   -For production, select the production mode from upper left corner and generate an fill the other fields. After that, generate an Autumn Secret Key

   - Add to `.env`:

   ```env
   AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY=your_autumn_secret
   ```

### Environment Variables

Run `pnpm nizzy env` to setup your environment variables. It will copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables for you.
For local development a connection string example is provided in the `.env.example` file located in the same folder as the database.

### Database Setup

Zero uses PostgreSQL for storing data. Here&#039;s how to set it up:

1. **Start the Database**

   Run this command to start a local PostgreSQL instance:

   ```bash
   pnpm docker:db:up
   ```

   This creates a database with:

   - Name: `zerodotemail`
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `postgres`
   - Port: `5432`

2. **Set Up Database Connection**

   Make sure your database connection string is in `.env` file. And you have ran `pnpm nizzy sync` to sync the latest env.

   For local development use:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&quot;postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/zerodotemail&quot;
   ```

3. **Database Commands**

   - **Set up database tables**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:push
     ```

   - **Create migration files** (after schema changes):

     ```bash
     pnpm db:generate
     ```

   - **Apply migrations**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:migrate
     ```

   - **View database content**:
     ```bash
     pnpm db:studio
     ```
     &gt; If you run `pnpm dev` in your terminal, the studio command should be automatically running with the app.

### Basic

- Default Stacks Directory: `/opt/stacks`
- Default Port: 5001

```
# Create directories that store your stacks and stores Dockge&#039;s stack
mkdir -p /opt/stacks /opt/dockge
cd /opt/dockge

# Download the compose.yaml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louislam/dockge/master/compose.yaml --output compose.yaml

# Start the server
docker compose up -d

# If you are using docker-compose V1 or Podman
# docker-compose up -d
```

Dockge is now running on http://localhost:5001

### Advanced

If you want to store your stacks in another directory, you can generate your compose.yaml file by using the following URL with custom query strings.

```
# Download your compose.yaml
curl &quot;https://dockge.kuma.pet/compose.yaml?port=5001&amp;stacksPath=/opt/stacks&quot; --output compose.yaml
```

- port=`5001`
- stacksPath=`/opt/stacks`

Interactive compose.yaml generator is available on: 
https://dockge.kuma.pet

## How to Update

```bash
cd /opt/dockge
docker compose pull &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d
```

## Motivations

- I have been using Portainer for some time, but for the stack management, I am sometimes not satisfied with it. For example, sometimes when I try to deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.
- Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript

If you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.

## FAQ

#### &quot;Dockge&quot;?

&quot;Dockge&quot; is a coinage word which is created by myself. I originally hoped it sounds like `Dodge`, but apparently many people called it `Dockage`, it is also acceptable.

The naming idea came from Twitch emotes like `sadge`, `bedge` or `wokege`. They all end in `-ge`.

#### Can I manage a single container without `compose.yaml`?

The main objective of Dockge is to try to use the docker `compose.yaml` for everything. If you want to manage a single container, you can just use Portainer or Docker CLI.

#### Can I manage existing stacks?

Yes, you can. However, you need to move your compose file into the stacks directory:

1. Stop your stack
2. Move your compose file into `/opt/stacks/&lt;stackName&gt;/compose.yaml`
3. In Dockge, click the &quot; Scan Stacks Folder&quot; button in the top-right corner&#039;s dropdown menu
4. Now you should see your stack in the list

#### Is Dockge a Portainer replacement?

Yes or no. Portainer provides a lot of Docker features. While Dockge is currently only focusing on docker-compose with a better user interface and better user experience.

If you want to manage your container with docker-compose only, the answer may be yes.

If you still need to manage something like docker networks, single containers, the answer may be no.

#### Can I install both Dockge and Portainer?

Yes, you can.

## Others

Dockge is built on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/). `compose.yaml`  also known as `docker-compose.yml`.

## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

## Why Teable?

No-code tools have significantly speed up how we get things done, allowing non-tech users to build amazing apps and changing the way many work and live. People like using spreadsheet-like UI to handle their data because it&#039;s easy, flexible, and great for team collaboration. They also prefer designing their app screens without being stuck with clunky templates.

Giving non-techy people the ability to create their software sounds exciting. But that&#039;s just the start:

- As businesses expand, their data needs intensify. No one wishes to hear that once their orders reach 100k, they&#039;ll outgrow their current interface. Yet, many no-code platforms falter at such scales.
- Most no-code platforms are cloud-based. This means your important data sits with the provider, and switching to another platform can be a headache.
- Sometimes, no-code tools can&#039;t do what you want because of their limitations, leaving users stuck.
- If a tool becomes essential, you&#039;ll eventually need some tech expertise. But developers often find these platforms tricky.
- Maintaining systems with complex setups can be hard for developers, especially if these aren&#039;t built using common software standards.
- Systems that don&#039;t use these standards might need revamping or replacing, costing more in the long run. It might even mean ditching the no-code route and going back to traditional coding.

#### What We Think the Future Of No-code Products Look Like

- An interface that anyone can use to build applications easily.
- Easy access to data, letting users grab, move, and reuse their information as they wish.
- Data privacy and choice, whether that&#039;s in the cloud, on-premise, or even just on your local.
- It needs to work for developers too, not just non-tech users.
- It should handle lots of data, so it can grow with your business.
- Flexibility to integrate with other software, combining strengths to get the job done.
- Last, native AI integration to takes usability to the next level.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Claude Code Router

&gt; This is a tool for routing Claude Code requests to different models, and you can customize any request.

![](screenshoots/claude-code.png)

## Usage

1. Install Claude Code

```shell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Install Claude Code Router

```shell
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

3. Start Claude Code by claude-code-router

```shell
ccr code
```

4. Configure routing[optional]  
   Set up your `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` file like this:

```json
{
  &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;sk-xxx&quot;,
  &quot;OPENAI_BASE_URL&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com&quot;,
  &quot;OPENAI_MODEL&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;,
  &quot;Providers&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;openrouter&quot;,
      &quot;api_base_url&quot;: &quot;https://openrouter.ai/api/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;sk-xxx&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [
        &quot;google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview&quot;,
        &quot;anthropic/claude-sonnet-4&quot;,
        &quot;anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet&quot;,
        &quot;anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking&quot;
      ]
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;deepseek&quot;,
      &quot;api_base_url&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;sk-xxx&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [&quot;deepseek-reasoner&quot;]
    },
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;ollama&quot;,
      &quot;api_base_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;,
      &quot;api_key&quot;: &quot;ollama&quot;,
      &quot;models&quot;: [&quot;qwen2.5-coder:latest&quot;]
    }
  ],
  &quot;Router&quot;: {
    &quot;background&quot;: &quot;ollama,qwen2.5-coder:latest&quot;,
    &quot;think&quot;: &quot;deepseek,deepseek-reasoner&quot;,
    &quot;longContext&quot;: &quot;openrouter,google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview&quot;
  }
}
```

- `background`  
  This model will be used to handle some background tasks([background-token-usage](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/costs#background-token-usage)). Based on my tests, it doesn’t require high intelligence. I’m using the qwen-coder-2.5:7b model running locally on my MacBook Pro M1 (32GB) via Ollama.
  If your computer can’t run Ollama, you can also use some free models, such as qwen-coder-2.5:3b.

- `think`  
  This model will be used when enabling Claude Code to perform reasoning. However, reasoning budget control has not yet been implemented (since the DeepSeek-R1 model does not support it), so there is currently no difference between using UltraThink and Think modes.
  It is worth noting that Plan Mode also use this model to achieve better planning results.  
  Note: The reasoning process via the official DeepSeek API may be very slow, so you may need to wait for an extended period of time.

- `longContext`  
  This model will be used when the context length exceeds 32K (this value may be modified in the future). You can route the request to a model that performs well with long contexts (I’ve chosen google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview). This scenario has not been thoroughly tested yet, so if you encounter any issues, please submit an issue.

- model command  
  You can also switch models within Claude Code by using the `/model` command. The format is: `provider,model`, like this:  
  `/model openrouter,anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`  
  This will use the anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet model provided by OpenRouter to handle all subsequent tasks.

## Features

- [x] Support change models
- [x] Github Actions
- [ ] More robust plugin support
- [ ] More detailed logs

## Plugins
You can modify or enhance Claude Code’s functionality by installing plugins. The mechanism works by using middleware to modify request parameters — this allows you to rewrite prompts or add/remove tools.

To use a plugin, place it in the ~/.claude-code-router/plugins/ directory and specify the plugin name in config.js using the `usePlugins` option.like this
```json
// ~/.claud-code-router/config.json
{
  ...,
  &quot;usePlugins&quot;: [&quot;notebook-tools-filter&quot;, &quot;toolcall-improvement&quot;]
}
```

Currently, the following plugins are available:


- **notebook-tools-filter**    
This plugin filters out tool calls related to Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files). You can use it if your work does not involve Jupyter.


- **toolcall-improvement**    
If your LLM doesn’t handle tool usage well (for example, always returning code as plain text instead of modifying files — such as with deepseek-v3), you can use this plugin.    
This plugin simply adds the following system prompt. If you have a better prompt, you can modify it.
```markdown
## **Important Instruction:**  
You must use tools as frequently and accurately as possible to help the user solve their problem.  
Prioritize tool usage whenever it can enhance accuracy, efficiency, or the quality of the response.
```


## Github Actions
You just need to install `Claude Code Actions` in your repository according to the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions). For `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, you can use any string. Then, modify your `.github/workflows/claude.yaml` file to include claude-code-router, like this:
```yaml
name: Claude Code

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:

  issues:

        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
      
      - name: Prepare Environment
        run: |
          curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
          mkdir -p $HOME/.claude-code-router
          cat &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039; &gt; $HOME/.claude-code-router/config.json
          {
            &quot;log&quot;: true,
            &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}&quot;,
            &quot;OPENAI_BASE_URL&quot;: &quot;https://api.deepseek.com&quot;,
            &quot;OPENAI_MODEL&quot;: &quot;deepseek-chat&quot;
          }
          EOF
        shell: bash
        
      - name: Start Claude Code Router
        run: |
          nohup ~/.bun/bin/bunx @musistudio/claude-code-router@1.0.8 start &amp;
        shell: bash

      - name: Run Claude Code
        id: claude
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3456
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: &quot;test&quot;
```
You can modify the contents of `$HOME/.claude-code-router/config.json` as needed.
GitHub Actions support allows you to trigger Claude Code at specific times, which opens up some interesting possibilities.

For example, between 00:30 and 08:30 Beijing Time, using the official DeepSeek API:

- The cost of the `deepseek-v3` model is only 50% of the normal time.

- The `deepseek-r1` model is just 25% of the normal time.

So maybe in the future, I’ll describe detailed tasks for Claude Code ahead of time and let it run during these discounted hours to reduce costs?


## Some tips:

Now you can use deepseek-v3 models directly without using any plugins.

If you’re using the DeepSeek API provided by the official website, you might encounter an “exceeding context” error after several rounds of conversation (since the official API only supports a 64K context window). In this case, you’ll need to discard the previous context and start fresh. Alternatively, you can use ByteDance’s DeepSeek API, which offers a 128K context window and supports KV cache.

![](screenshoots/contexterror.jpg)

Note: claude code consumes a huge amount of tokens, but thanks to DeepSeek’s low cost, you can use claude code at a fraction of Claude’s price, and you don’t need to subscribe to the Claude Max plan.

Some interesting points: Based on my testing, including a lot of context information can help narrow the performance gap between these LLM models. For instance, when I used Claude-4 in VSCode Copilot to handle a Flutter issue, it messed up the files in three rounds of conversation, and I had to roll everything back. However, when I used claude code with DeepSeek, after three or four rounds of conversation, I finally managed to complete my task—and the cost was less than 1 RMB!

- Adaptive scraping interval (minimum 2 minutes) based on source update frequency to optimize resource usage and prevent IP bans
- support MCP server

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;newsnow&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;newsnow-mcp-server&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;BASE_URL&quot;: &quot;https://newsnow.busiyi.world&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
You can change the `BASE_URL` to your own domain.

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment

For deployments without login and caching:

1. Fork this repository
2. Import to platforms like Cloudflare Page or Vercel

### Cloudflare Page Configuration

- Build command: `pnpm run build`
- Output directory: `dist/output/public`

### GitHub OAuth Setup

1. [Create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. No special permissions required
3. Set callback URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain)
4. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret

### Environment Variables

Refer to `example.env.server`. For local development, rename it to `.env.server` and configure:

```env
# Github Client ID
G_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

### Database Support

Supported database connectors: https://db0.unjs.io/connectors
**Cloudflare D1 Database** is recommended.

1. Create D1 database in Cloudflare Worker dashboard
2. Configure database_id and database_name in wrangler.toml
3. If wrangler.toml doesn&#039;t exist, rename example.wrangler.toml and modify configurations
4. Changes will take effect on next deployment

### Docker Deployment

In project root directory:

```sh
docker compose up
```

You can also set Environment Variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Development

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Requires Node.js &gt;= 20

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## ⚠️ Why TriliumNext?

[The original Trilium project is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/issues/4620).

### Migrating from Trilium?

There are no special migration steps to migrate from a zadam/Trilium instance to a TriliumNext/Notes instance. Simply [install TriliumNext/Notes](#-installation) as usual and it will use your existing database.

Versions up to and including [v0.90.4](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/releases/tag/v0.90.4) are compatible with the latest zadam/trilium version of [v0.63.7](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.63.7). Any later versions of TriliumNext have their sync versions incremented.

## 📖 Documentation

We&#039;re currently in the progress of moving the documentation to in-app (hit the `F1` key within Trilium). As a result, there may be some missing parts until we&#039;ve completed the migration. If you&#039;d prefer to navigate through the documentation within GitHub, you can navigate the [User Guide](./docs/User%20Guide/User%20Guide/) documentation.

智能音视频字幕生成与多语言翻译批量化解决方案

![preview](./resources/preview.png)

## 💥特性

它保留了之前 [VideoSubtitleGenerator](https://github.com/buxuku/VideoSubtitleGenerator) 这个命令行工具的全部特性，并新增了以下功能:

- 支持多种视频/音频格式生成字幕
- 支持对生成的字幕，或者导入的字幕进行翻译
- 本地化处理，无须上传视频，保护隐私的同时也拥有更快的处理速度
- 支持多种翻译服务:
  - 火山引擎翻译
  - 百度翻译
  - 微软翻译器
  - DeepLX 翻译 （批量翻译容易存在被限流的情况）
  - 本地模型 Ollama 翻译
  - AI聚合平台 [DeerAPI](https://api.deerapi.com/register?aff=QvHM)
  - 支持 OpenAI 风格 API 翻译，如 [deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) 等
- 自定义字幕文件名，方便兼容不同的播放器挂载字幕识别
- 自定义翻译后的字幕文件内容，支持纯翻译结果或原字幕+翻译结果
- 支持硬件加速
  - NVIDIA CUDA（Windows/Linux）
  - Apple Core ML（macOS M系列芯片）
- 支持运行本地安装的 `whisper` 命令
- 支持自定义并发任务数量

## 关于 CUDA 的支持

因为本人使用的是苹果芯片，缺少 window CUDA 的开发环境，对于 CUDA 的支持，开发测试都存在较多场景无法兼顾的情况。

- 目前提供了 CUDA 11.8.0 和 12.2.0 及 12.4.1 版本的编译，是通过 github action 自动编译的，可能存在环境的兼容问题
- 要启用 CUDA，需要确定自己的电脑支持 CUDA, 并安装了 CUDA toolkit. [CUDA download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- CUDA toolkit 的版本理论上是向后兼容，请根据你显卡支持的版本，选择合适的版本
- 如果下载 generic 使用有问题，可以下载 optimized 版本，这个版本是针对各个系列显卡的优化版本，兼容性更强

## 关于 Core ML 的支持

从 1.20.0 版本开始，在苹果芯片上，支持使用 Core ML 加速语音识别。如果是苹果芯片，请下载 mac arm64 版本的 release 包。将会自动启动 Core ML 加速。

## 翻译服务

本项目支持多种翻译服务，包括百度翻译、火山引擎翻译、DeepLX、Ollama 本地模型、 DeepSeek 以及 OpenAI 风格的 API。使用这些服务需要相应的 API 密钥或配置。

对于百度翻译、火山引擎等服务的 API 申请方法，可以参考 https://bobtranslate.com/service/ ，感谢 [Bob](https://bobtranslate.com/) 这款优秀的软件提供的信息。

对于 AI 翻译，翻译结果受模型和提示词的影响比较大，你可以尝试不同的模型和提示词，找到适合自己的组合。推荐可以尝试 AI 聚合平台 [DeerAPI](https://api.deerapi.com/register?aff=QvHM), 支持多个平台近 500 种模型，选择合适自己的模型进行翻译。

## 模型的选择

从视频或者音频里面，生成字幕文件，需要使用到 whisper 的模型。 whisper 的模型有多种，不同的模型，生成字幕的准确性不同，处理速度也不同。

- 模型越大，准确性越高，对显卡要求也高，处理速度越慢
- 低端设备或者显卡，推荐 `tiny` 或者 `base` 系列的模型，准确性虽然不如 `large` 系列，但是处理速度快，占用显存小
- 普通电脑设备，建议从 `small` 或者 `base` 开始，平衡精度与资源消耗
- 对于高性能显卡/工作站，推荐使用 `large` 系列的模型，准确性高
- 如果原始音视频是英文，推荐使用带 `en` 的模型，专为英语优化，减少多语言干扰
- 如果在乎模型大小，可以考虑使用 `q5` 或者 `q8` 系列的模型，相对于非量化版本，牺牲少量精度换取更小体积

## 🔦使用 (普通用户)

请根据自己的电脑系统，芯片，显卡，选择下载对应安装包。

- 带 _generic_ 的版本，是通用的版本，理论上支持常见的显卡
- 带 _optimized_ 的版本，是优化版本，提供了针对各个系列显卡的优化，兼容性更强

| 系统    | 芯片  | 显卡                    | 下载安装包             |
| ------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Windows | x64   | CUDA &gt;= 11.8.0 &lt; 12.0.0 | windows-x64_cuda11.8.0 |
| Windows | x64   | CUDA &gt;= 12.4.1          | windows-x64_cuda12.4.1 |
| Windows | x64   | CUDA &gt;= 12.2.0          | windows-x64_cuda12.2.0 |
| Windows | x64   | 无 CUDA                 | windows-x64_no_cuda    |
| Mac     | Apple | 支持 CoreML             | mac-arm64              |
| Mac     | Intel | 不支持 CoreML           | mac-x64                |

1. 前往 [release](https://github.com/buxuku/SmartSub/releases) 页面根据自己的操作系统下载安装包
2. 或者使用网盘 [夸克](https://pan.quark.cn/s/0b16479b40ca) 选择对应的版本进行下载
3. 安装并运行程序
4. 下载模型
5. 在程序中配置所需的翻译服务
6. 选择要处理的音视频文件或字幕文件
7. 设置相关参数（如源语言、目标语言、模型等）
8. 开始处理任务

## 🔦使用 (开发用户)

1️⃣ 克隆本项目在本地

```shell
git clone https://github.com/buxuku/SmartSub.git
```

2️⃣ 在项目中执行 `yarn install` 或者 `npm install`

```shell
cd SmartSub
yarn install
```

如果是 windows 平台，或者 Mac intel 平台，请前往 https://github.com/buxuku/whisper.cpp/releases/tag/latest 下载对应的 node 文件，并重命名为 `addon.node` , 覆盖放在 `extraResources/addons/` 目录下。

3️⃣ 依赖包安装好之后，执行 `yarn dev` 或者 `npm run dev` 启动项目

```shell
yarn dev
```

## 手动下载和导入模型

因为模型文件比较大，如果通过该软件下载模型会存在难以下载的情况，可以手动下载模型并导入到应用中。以下是两个可用于下载模型的链接：

1. 国内镜像源（下载速度较快）：
   https://hf-mirror.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

2. Hugging Face 官方源：
   https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

如果是苹果芯片，需要同时下载模型对应的 encoder.mlmodelc 文件。并解压出来放在模型相同目录下。（如果是 q5 或者 q8 系列的模型，无须下载该文件）

下载完成后，您可以通过应用的&quot;模型管理&quot;页面中的&quot;导入模型&quot;功能将下载的模型文件导入到应用中。或者直接复制到模型目录里面即可。

导入步骤：

1. 在&quot;模型管理&quot;页面中，点击&quot;导入模型&quot;按钮。
2. 在弹出的文件选择器中，选择您下载的模型文件。
3. 确认导入后，模型将被添加到您的已安装模型列表中。

## 常见问题

##### 1.提示应用程序已损坏，无法打开。

在终端中执行以下命令：

```shell
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SmartSub.app
```

然后再次运行应用程序。

## Zerox OCR

&lt;/a&gt;

A dead simple way of OCR-ing a document for AI ingestion. Documents are meant to be a visual representation after all. With weird layouts, tables, charts, etc. The vision models just make sense!

The general logic:

- Pass in a file (PDF, DOCX, image, etc.)
- Convert that file into a series of images
- Pass each image to GPT and ask nicely for Markdown
- Aggregate the responses and return Markdown

## Node Zerox

(Node.js SDK - supports vision models from different providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, etc.)

### Installation

```sh
npm install zerox
```

Zerox uses `graphicsmagick` and `ghostscript` for the PDF =&gt; image processing step. These should be pulled automatically, but you may need to manually install.

On linux use:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y graphicsmagick
```

## Usage

**With file URL**

```ts
import { zerox } from &quot;zerox&quot;;

const result = await zerox({
  filePath: &quot;https://omni-demo-data.s3.amazonaws.com/test/cs101.pdf&quot;,
  credentials: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

**From local path**

```ts
import { zerox } from &quot;zerox&quot;;
import path from &quot;path&quot;;

const result = await zerox({
  filePath: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;./cs101.pdf&quot;),
  credentials: {
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

### Parameters

```ts
const result = await zerox({
  // Required
  filePath: &quot;path/to/file&quot;,
  credentials: {
    apiKey: &quot;your-api-key&quot;,
    // Additional provider-specific credentials as needed
  },

  // Optional
  cleanup: true, // Clear images from tmp after run
  concurrency: 10, // Number of pages to run at a time
  correctOrientation: true, // True by default, attempts to identify and correct page orientation
  directImageExtraction: false, // Extract data directly from document images instead of the markdown
  errorMode: ErrorMode.IGNORE, // ErrorMode.THROW or ErrorMode.IGNORE, defaults to ErrorMode.IGNORE
  extractionPrompt: &quot;&quot;, // LLM instructions for extracting data from document
  extractOnly: false, // Set to true to only extract structured data using a schema
  extractPerPage, // Extract data per page instead of the entire document
  imageDensity: 300, // DPI for image conversion
  imageHeight: 2048, // Maximum height for converted images
  llmParams: {}, // Additional parameters to pass to the LLM
  maintainFormat: false, // Slower but helps maintain consistent formatting
  maxImageSize: 15, // Maximum size of images to compress, defaults to 15MB
  maxRetries: 1, // Number of retries to attempt on a failed page, defaults to 1
  maxTesseractWorkers: -1, // Maximum number of Tesseract workers. Zerox will start with a lower number and only reach maxTesseractWorkers if needed
  model: ModelOptions.OPENAI_GPT_4O, // Model to use (supports various models from different providers)
  modelProvider: ModelProvider.OPENAI, // Choose from OPENAI, BEDROCK, GOOGLE, or AZURE
  outputDir: undefined, // Save combined result.md to a file
  pagesToConvertAsImages: -1, // Page numbers to convert to image as array (e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`) or a number (e.g. `1`). Set to -1 to convert all pages
  prompt: &quot;&quot;, // LLM instructions for processing the document
  schema: undefined, // Schema for structured data extraction
  tempDir: &quot;/os/tmp&quot;, // Directory to use for temporary files (default: system temp directory)
  trimEdges: true, // True by default, trims pixels from all edges that contain values similar to the given background color, which defaults to that of the top-left pixel
});
```

The `maintainFormat` option tries to return the markdown in a consistent format by passing the output of a prior page in as additional context for the next page. This requires the requests to run synchronously, so it&#039;s a lot slower. But valuable if your documents have a lot of tabular data, or frequently have tables that cross pages.

```
Request #1 =&gt; page_1_image
Request #2 =&gt; page_1_markdown + page_2_image
Request #3 =&gt; page_2_markdown + page_3_image
```

### Data Extraction

Zerox supports structured data extraction from documents using a schema. This allows you to pull specific information from documents in a structured format instead of getting the full markdown conversion.

Set `extractOnly: true` and provide a `schema` to extract structured data. The schema follows the [JSON Schema standard](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/).

Use `extractPerPage` to extract data per page instead of from the whole document at once.

You can also set `extractionModel`, `extractionModelProvider`, and `extractionCredentials` to use a different model for extraction than OCR. By default, the same model is used.

## Python Zerox

(Python SDK - supports vision models from different providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, etc.)

### Installation

- Install **poppler** on the system, it should be available in path variable. See the [pdf2image documentation](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for instructions by platform.
- Install py-zerox:

```sh
pip install py-zerox
```

The `pyzerox.zerox` function is an asynchronous API that performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to markdown using vision models. It processes PDF files and converts them into markdown format. Make sure to set up the environment variables for the model and the model provider before using this API.

Refer to the [LiteLLM Documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for setting up the environment and passing the correct model name.

### Usage

```python
from pyzerox import zerox
import os
import json
import asyncio

### Model Setup (Use only Vision Models) Refer: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers ###

                    &#039;its identifier. For example:\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;```java\n&#039; +

                    &#039;Each declaration specifies the variable’s type followed by the identifier and ending with a &#039; +
                    &#039;semicolon. The identifier rules are fairly standard: a name can consist of lowercase and &#039; +
                    &#039;uppercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and underscores but may not begin with a numeric &#039; +
                    &#039;character. We adopt the modern camelCasing naming convention for variables in our code. In &#039; +
                    &#039;general, variables must be assigned a value before you can use them in an expression. You do not &#039; +
                    &#039;have to immediately assign a value when you declare them (though it is good practice), but some &#039; +
                    &#039;value must be assigned before they can be used or the compiler will issue an error.\n\n&#039; +
                    &#039;The assignment operator is a single equal sign, `=` and is a right-to-left assignment. That is, &#039; +
                    &#039;the variable that we wish to assign the value to appears on the left-hand-side while the value &#039; +
                    &#039;(literal, variable or expression) is on the right-hand-side. Using our variables from before, &#039; +
                    &#039;we can assign them values:\n\n&#039; +

                    &#039;For objects, the default is `null`, for all numeric types, zero is the default value. For the &#039; +
                    &#039;boolean type, `false` is the default, and the default char value is `\\0`, the null-terminating &#039; +

## Supported File Types

We use a combination of `libreoffice` and `graphicsmagick` to do document =&gt; image conversion. For non-image / non-PDF files, we use libreoffice to convert that file to a PDF, and then to an image.

```js

  &quot;pdf&quot;, // Portable Document Format
  &quot;doc&quot;, // Microsoft Word 97-2003
  &quot;docx&quot;, // Microsoft Word 2007-2019
  &quot;odt&quot;, // OpenDocument Text
  &quot;ott&quot;, // OpenDocument

Focalboard is an open source, multilingual, self-hosted project management tool that&#039;s an alternative to Trello, Notion, and Asana.

It helps define, organize, track and manage work across individuals and teams. Focalboard comes in two editions:

* **[Personal Desktop](https://www.focalboard.com/docs/personal-edition/desktop/)**: A standalone, single-user [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1556908618?pt=2114704&amp;ct=website&amp;mt=8), [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NLN2T0SX9VF?cid=website), or [Linux](https://www.focalboard.com/download/personal-edition/desktop/#linux-desktop) desktop app for your own todos and personal projects.

* **[Personal Server](https://www.focalboard.com/download/personal-edition/ubuntu/)**: A standalone, multi-user server for development and personal use.

## Try Focalboard

### Personal Desktop (Windows, Mac or Linux Desktop)

* **Windows**: Download from the [Windows App Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NLN2T0SX9VF) or download `focalboard-win.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/releases), unpack, and run `Focalboard.exe`.
* **Mac**: Download from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focalboard-insiders/id1556908618?mt=12).
* **Linux Desktop**: Download `focalboard-linux.tar.gz` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/releases), unpack, and open `focalboard-app`.

### Personal Server

**Ubuntu**: You can download and run the compiled Focalboard **Personal Server** on Ubuntu by following [our latest install guide](https://www.focalboard.com/download/personal-edition/ubuntu/).

### API Docs

Boards API docs can be found over at &lt;https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/server/swagger/docs/html/index.html&gt;

### Getting started

Our [developer guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/focalboard/personal-server-setup-guide) has detailed instructions on how to set up your development environment for the **Personal Server**. You can also join the [~Focalboard community channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/focalboard) to connect with other developers.

Create an `.env` file in the focalboard directory that contains:

```
EXCLUDE_ENTERPRISE=&quot;1&quot;
```

To build the server:

```
make prebuild
make
```

To run the server:

```
 ./bin/focalboard-server
```

Then navigate your browser to [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) to access your Focalboard server. The port is configured in `config.json`.

Once the server is running, you can rebuild just the web app via `make webapp` in a separate terminal window. Reload your browser to see the changes.

### Building and running standalone desktop apps

You can build standalone apps that package the server to run locally against SQLite:

* **Windows**:
  * *Requires Windows 10, [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive/) 10.0.19041.0, and .NET 4.8 developer pack*
  * Open a `git-bash` prompt.
  * Run `make prebuild`
  * The above prebuild step needs to be run only when you make changes to or want to install your npm dependencies, etc.
  * Once the prebuild is completed, you can keep repeating the below steps to build the app &amp; see the changes.
  * Run `make win-wpf-app`
  * Run `cd win-wpf/msix &amp;&amp; focalboard.exe`
* **Mac**:
  * *Requires macOS 11.3+ and Xcode 13.2.1+*
  * Run `make prebuild`
  * The above prebuild step needs to be run only when you make changes to or want to install your npm dependencies, etc.
  * Once the prebuild is completed, you can keep repeating the below steps to build the app &amp; see the changes.
  * Run `make mac-app`
  * Run `open mac/dist/Focalboard.app`
* **Linux**:
  * *Tested on Ubuntu 18.04*
  * Install `webgtk` dependencies
    * Run `sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev`
    * Run `sudo apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`
  * Run `make prebuild`
  * The above prebuild step needs to be run only when you make changes to or want to install your npm dependencies, etc.
  * Once the prebuild is completed, you can keep repeating the below steps to build the app &amp; see the changes.
  * Run `make linux-app`
  * Uncompress `linux/dist/focalboard-linux.tar.gz` to a directory of your choice
  * Run `focalboard-app` from the directory you have chosen
* **Docker**:
  * To run it locally from offical image:
    * `docker run -it -p 80:8000 mattermost/focalboard`
  * To build it for your current architecture:
    * `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .`
  * To build it for a custom architecture (experimental):
    * `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --platform linux/arm64 .`

Cross-compilation currently isn&#039;t fully supported, so please build on the appropriate platform. Refer to the GitHub Actions workflows (`build-mac.yml`, `build-win.yml`, `build-ubuntu.yml`) for the detailed list of steps on each platform.

### Unit testing

Before checking in commits, run `make ci`, which is similar to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` workflow and includes:

* **Server unit tests**: `make server-test`
* **Web app ESLint**: `cd webapp; npm run check`
* **Web app unit tests**: `cd webapp; npm run test`
* **Web app UI tests**: `cd webapp; npm run cypress:ci`

### Staying informed

* **Changes**: See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updates
