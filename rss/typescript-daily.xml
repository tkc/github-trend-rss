### Onlook for Desktop (aka Onlook Alpha)

We&#039;re in early preview for Onlook Web. If you&#039;re looking for the downloadable desktop electron app, it&#039;s moved to [Onlook Desktop](https://github.com/onlook-dev/desktop).

Why are we moving to the web? Read about our decision: 
[Migrating from Electron to Web](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/electron-to-web-migration)

## Getting Started

Available soon with a [hosted app](https://onlook.com) or
[run locally](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/running-locally).

### Usage

Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project
through into Onlook or start from scratch within the editor.

Use the AI chat to create or edit a project you&#039;re working on. At any time, you can
always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element in
code.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad9f411-b172-4430-81ef-650f4f314666&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Draw-in new divs and re-arrange them within their parent containers by dragging-and-dropping.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/insert-div.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Preview the code side-by-side with your site design.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/code-connect.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Use Onlook&#039;s editor toolbar to adjust Tailwind styles, directly manipulate objects, and experiment with layouts.

To see how to Contribute, visit
[Contributing to Onlook](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/contributing) in our docs.

## How it works

&lt;img width=&quot;676&quot; alt=&quot;architecture&quot; src=&quot;assets/architecture.png&quot;&gt;

1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container
2. The container runs and serves the code
3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame
4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container
5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code
6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code
7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code

This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that
displays DOM elements declaratively (e.g. jsx/tsx/html). We are focused on making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS for now.

For a full walkthrough, check out our
[Architecture Docs](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/architecture).

&lt;/div&gt;

[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/) is a suite of advanced React UI components for a wide range of complex use cases.
Each component provides best-in-class UX and DX, with sophisticated UX workflows for data-rich applications.
Components include the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree View.

MUI X extends the core functionality of [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/), but the advanced components also stand on their own and can be fully customized to meet the needs of any design system.

MUI X is **open-core**: [Community](#community-plan) components are MIT-licensed and free forever, while more advanced features and components require a [Pro](#pro-plan) or [Premium](#premium-plan) commercial license.
See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.

## Licensing

The MUI X team has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, starting with Material UI, and we&#039;re committed to the continued advancement of our open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
Learn more about [our stewardship ethos](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced components and features that can&#039;t reasonably be maintained by the open-source community alone.
These licenses make it possible for us to support a full-time staff of engineers.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it&#039;s only because we believe you won&#039;t find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

### Plans

#### Community plan

The free Community version of MUI X contains components and features that we believe are maintainable by contributions from the open-source community.
It&#039;s published under an [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and it&#039;s [free forever](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd#20f609acab4441cf9346614119fbbac1).

- [`@mui/x-charts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-charts)
- [`@mui/x-tree-view`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-tree-view)

#### Pro plan

MUI X Pro expands on the Community version with more advanced features and functionality.
The Data Grid Pro comes with multi-filtering, multi-sorting, column resizing, and column pinning; you also gain access to the Date and Time Range Picker components, advanced Charts, and drag-and-drop reordering for the Tree View.

The Pro version is available under a commercial license—visit the [Pricing page](https://mui.com/pricing/) for details.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># [Squoosh]!

[Squoosh] is an image compression web app that reduces image sizes through numerous formats.

# Privacy

Squoosh does not send your image to a server. All image compression processes locally.

However, Squoosh utilizes Google Analytics to collect the following:

- [Basic visitor data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?ref_topic=2919631).
- The before and after image size value.
- If Squoosh PWA, the type of Squoosh installation.
- If Squoosh PWA, the installation time and date.

# Developing

To develop for Squoosh:

1. Clone the repository
1. To install node packages, run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
1. Then build the app by running:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
1. After building, start the development server by running:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features, and more, allowing you to quickly move from prototype to production.

## Quick start

&gt; Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
&gt;
&gt; - CPU &gt;= 2 Core
&gt; - RAM &gt;= 4 GiB

&lt;/br&gt;

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [docker compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

## Features


### Application Performance Monitoring

Use SigNoz APM to monitor your applications and services. It comes with out-of-box charts for key application metrics like p99 latency, error rate, Apdex and operations per second. You can also monitor the database and external calls made from your application. Read [more](https://signoz.io/application-performance-monitoring/).

You can [instrument](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) your application with OpenTelemetry to get started.

![apm-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa5c0396-0854-4c8b-b972-9b62fd2a70d2)


### Logs Management

SigNoz can be used as a centralized log management solution. We use ClickHouse (used by likes of Uber &amp; Cloudflare) as a datastore, ⎯ an extremely fast and highly optimized storage for logs data. Instantly search through all your logs using quick filters and a powerful query builder.

You can also create charts on your logs and monitor them with customized dashboards. Read [more](https://signoz.io/log-management/).

![logs-management-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343588ee-98fb-4310-b3d2-c5bacf9c7384)


### Distributed Tracing

Distributed Tracing is essential to troubleshoot issues in microservices applications. Powered by OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing in SigNoz can help you track user requests across services to help you identify performance bottlenecks. 

See user requests in a detailed breakdown with the help of Flamegraphs and Gantt Charts. Click on any span to see the entire trace represented beautifully, which will help you make sense of where issues actually occurred in the flow of requests.

### Metrics and Dashboards

Ingest metrics from your infrastructure or applications and create customized dashboards to monitor them. Create visualization that suits your needs with a variety of panel types like pie chart, time-series, bar chart, etc.

Create queries on your metrics data quickly with an easy-to-use metrics query builder. Add multiple queries and combine those queries with formulae to create really complex queries quickly.

### Alerts

Use alerts in SigNoz to get notified when anything unusual happens in your application. You can set alerts on any type of telemetry signal (logs, metrics, traces), create thresholds and set up a notification channel to get notified. Advanced features like alert history and anomaly detection can help you create smarter alerts.

Alerts in SigNoz help you identify issues proactively so that you can address them before they reach your customers.

### Exceptions Monitoring

Monitor exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript. For other languages, just drop in a few lines of code and start monitoring exceptions.

See the detailed stack trace for all exceptions caught in your application. You can also log in custom attributes to add more context to your exceptions. For example, you can add attributes to identify users for which exceptions occurred.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

## Why SigNoz?

SigNoz is a single tool for all your monitoring and observability needs. Here are a few reasons why you should choose SigNoz:

- Single tool for observability(logs, metrics, and traces)

- Built on top of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), the open-source standard which frees you from any type of vendor lock-in

- Correlated logs, metrics and traces for much richer context while debugging

- Uses ClickHouse (used by likes of Uber &amp; Cloudflare) as datastore - an extremely fast and highly optimized storage for observability data

- DIY Query builder, PromQL, and ClickHouse queries to fulfill all your use-cases around querying observability data

- Open-Source - you can use open-source, our [cloud service](https://signoz.io/teams/) or a mix of both based on your use case

## Comparisons to Familiar Tools

### SigNoz vs Prometheus

Prometheus is good if you want to do just metrics. But if you want to have a seamless experience between metrics, logs and traces, then current experience of stitching together Prometheus &amp; other tools is not great.

SigNoz is a one-stop solution for metrics and other telemetry signals. And because you will use the same standard(OpenTelemetry) to collect all telemetry signals, you can also correlate these signals to troubleshoot quickly.

For example, if you see that there are issues with infrastructure metrics of your k8s cluster at a timestamp, you can jump to other signals like logs and traces to understand the issue quickly.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp  &lt;/p&gt;

### SigNoz vs Jaeger

Jaeger only does distributed tracing. SigNoz supports metrics, traces and logs - all the 3 pillars of observability.

Moreover, SigNoz has few more advanced features wrt Jaeger:

- Jaegar UI doesn’t show any metrics on traces or on filtered traces
- Jaeger can’t get aggregates on filtered traces. For example, p99 latency of requests which have tag - customer_type=&#039;premium&#039;. This can be done easily on SigNoz
- You can also go from traces to logs easily in SigNoz

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp  &lt;/p&gt;

### SigNoz vs Elastic 

- SigNoz Logs management are based on ClickHouse, a columnar OLAP datastore which makes aggregate log analytics queries much more efficient
- 50% lower resource requirement compared to Elastic during ingestion

We have published benchmarks comparing Elastic with SigNoz. Check it out [here](https://signoz.io/blog/logs-performance-benchmark/?utm_source=github-readme&amp;utm_medium=logs-benchmark)

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp  &lt;/p&gt;

### SigNoz vs Loki

- SigNoz supports aggregations on high-cardinality data over a huge volume while loki doesn’t.
- SigNoz supports indexes over high cardinality data and has no limitations on the number of indexes, while Loki reaches max streams with a few indexes added to it.
- Searching over a huge volume of data is difficult and slow in Loki compared to SigNoz

We have published benchmarks comparing Loki with SigNoz. Check it out [here](https://signoz.io/blog/logs-performance-benchmark/?utm_source=github-readme&amp;utm_medium=logs-benchmark)

The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software development
framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

The CDK is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js &gt;= 20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
  * We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
* Python ([Python ≥ 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Java ([Java ≥ 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven ≥ 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
* .NET ([.NET ≥ 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
* Go ([Go ≥ 1.16.4](https://golang.org/))

Third-party Language Deprecation: language version is only supported until its EOL (End Of Life) shared by the vendor or community and is subject to change with prior notice.

-------

Developers use the [CDK framework] in one of the
supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which
are composed together into [stacks], forming a &quot;CDK app&quot;.

They then use the [AWS CDK CLI] to interact with their CDK app. The CLI allows developers to
synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and &quot;diff&quot;
against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The [AWS Construct Library] includes a module for each
AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of
how to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and
glue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals
on AWS.

Modules in the AWS Construct Library are designated Experimental while we build
them; experimental modules may have breaking API changes in any release.  After
a module is designated Stable, it adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
and only major releases can have breaking changes. Each module&#039;s stability designation
is available on its Overview page in the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html).
For more information, see [Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/reference.html#versioning)
in the CDK Developer Guide.

## Getting Started

For a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#hello_world_tutorial) in the AWS CDK [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

### At a glance

Install or update the [AWS CDK CLI] from npm (requires [Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/)). We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)

```sh
npm i -g aws-cdk
```

(See [Manual Installation](./MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md) for installing the CDK from a signed .zip file).

Initialize a project:

```sh
mkdir hello-cdk
cd hello-cdk
cdk init sample-app --language=typescript
```

This creates a sample project looking like this:

```ts
export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, &#039;HelloCdkQueue&#039;, {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, &#039;HelloCdkTopic&#039;);

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

Deploy this to your account:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

Use the `cdk` command-line toolkit to interact with your project:

* `cdk deploy`: deploys your app into an AWS account
* `cdk synth`: synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template for your app
* `cdk diff`: compares your app with the deployed stack

## Getting Help

The best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. You can open an [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose) and choose from one of our templates for bug reports, feature requests, documentation issues, or guidance.

# 🤯 Welcome to Activepieces

All-in-one AI automation designed to be **extensible** through a **type-safe** pieces framework written in **TypeScript**.
When you contribute pieces to Activepieces they become automatically available as MCP servers that you can use with LLMs through Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf!

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

## 🔥 Why Activepieces is Different:

- **💖 Loved by Everyone**: Intuitive interface and great experience for both technical and non-technical users with a quick learning curve.

&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/resources/templates.gif&quot;&gt;

- **🌐 Open Ecosystem:** All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, **60% of the pieces are contributed by the community**.

- **🛠️ Largest open source MCP toolkit**: All our pieces (280+) are available as MCP that you can use with LLMs on Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf.

- **🛠️  Pieces are written in Typescript**: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including **hot reloading** for **local** piece development on your machine. 😎

&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/resources/create-action.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

- **🤖 AI-First**: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK, and there is Copilot to help you build flows inside the builder.

- **🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

- **🔒 Secure by Design**: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

- **🧠 Human in the Loop**: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨

- **💻 Human Input Interfaces**: Built-in support for human input triggers like &quot;Chat Interface&quot; 💬 and &quot;Form Interface&quot; 📝



## 🛠️  Builder Features:

- [x] Loops
- [x] Branches
- [x] Auto Retries
- [x] HTTP
- [x] Code with **NPM**

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

## Intro

tRPC allows you to easily build &amp; consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

### Features

- ✅&amp;nbsp; Well-tested and production ready.
- 🧙‍♂️&amp;nbsp; Full static typesafety &amp; autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors.
- 🐎&amp;nbsp; Snappy DX - No code generation, run-time bloat, or build pipeline.
- 🍃&amp;nbsp; Light - tRPC has zero deps and a tiny client-side footprint.
- 🐻&amp;nbsp; Easy to add to your existing brownfield project.
- 🔋&amp;nbsp; Batteries included - React.js/Next.js/Express.js/Fastify adapters. _(But tRPC is not tied to React, and there are many [community adapters](https://trpc.io/docs/awesome-trpc#-extensions--community-add-ons) for other libraries)_
- 🥃&amp;nbsp; Subscriptions support.
- ⚡️&amp;nbsp; Request batching - requests made at the same time can be automatically combined into one
- 👀&amp;nbsp; Quite a few examples in the [./examples](./examples)-folder

## Quickstart

There are a few [examples](https://trpc.io/docs/example-apps) that you can use for playing out with tRPC or bootstrapping your new project. For example, if you want a Next.js app, you can use the full-stack Next.js example:

**Quick start with a full-stack Next.js example:**

```sh
# yarn
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# npm
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# pnpm
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# bun
bunx create-next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter

# deno
deno init --npm next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-starter trpc-prisma-starter
```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukevella/rallly.git
   cd rallly
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Setup environment variables

   Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.development`. This will be were you can set your [configuration options](https://support.rallly.co/self-hosting/configuration-options).

   ```bash
   cp .env.development .env
   ```

   **Note:** `.env.development` is preconfigured with default values for development. You can leave these as is for local development.

4. Generate Prisma client

   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   ```

# Frigate - NVR With Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras

A complete and local NVR designed for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a [Google Coral Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/) is optional, but highly recommended. The Coral will outperform even the best CPUs and can process 100+ FPS with very little overhead.

- Tight integration with Home Assistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
- WebRTC &amp; MSE support for low-latency live view
