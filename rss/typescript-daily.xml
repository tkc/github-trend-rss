## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

*Cooked up by [Alex Kern](https://kern.io) &amp; [Neeraj Baid](https://github.com/neerajbaid) while eating Sliver @ UC Berkeley.*

Using [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org), FilePizza eliminates the initial upload step required by other web-based file sharing services. Because data is never stored in an intermediary server, the transfer is fast, private, and secure.

A hosted instance of FilePizza is available at [file.pizza](https://file.pizza).

## What&#039;s new with FilePizza v2

* A new UI with dark mode support, now built on modern browser technologies.
* Works on most mobile browsers, including Mobile Safari.
* Transfers are now directly from the uploader to the downloader&#039;s browser (WebRTC without WebTorrent) with faster handshakes.
* Uploaders can monitor the progress of the transfer and stop it if they want.
* Better security and safety measures with password protection and reporting.
* Support for uploading multiple files at once, which downloaders receive as a zip file.
* Streaming downloads with a Service Worker.
* Out-of-process storage of server state using Redis.

## Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kern/filepizza.git
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm dev
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm start
```

## Running with Docker

```
$ pnpm docker:build
$ pnpm docker:up
$ pnpm docker:down
```

## Stack

* Next.js
* Tailwind
* TypeScript
* React
* PeerJS for WebRTC
* View Transitions
* Redis (optional)

## FAQ

**How are my files sent?** Your files are sent directly from your browser to the downloader&#039;s browser. They never pass through our servers. FilePizza uses WebRTC to send files. This requires that the uploader leave their browser window open until the transfer is complete.

**Can multiple people download my file at once?** Yes! Just send them your short or long URL.

**How big can my files be?** As big as your browser can handle.

**What happens when I close my browser?** The URLs for your files will no longer work. If a downloader has completed the transfer, that downloader will continue to seed to incomplete downloaders, but no new downloads may be initiated.

**Are my files encrypted?** Yes, all WebRTC communications are automatically encrypted using public-key cryptography because of DTLS. You can add an optional password to your upload for an extra layer of security.

## Editions of Beekeeper Studio

Beekeeper Studio is a single download with in-app upgrades for premium features.

We&#039;d love to make Beekeeper Studio totally free for everyone, but building good software is hard work and expensive. We think our paid editions are fairly priced, I hope you do too.

👉 [Compare Beekeeper Studio Editions](https://beekeeperstudio.io/pricing)

## Beekeeper Studio Features

Top feature: It&#039;s smooth 🍫, fast 🏎, and you&#039;ll actually enjoy using it 🥰

- Truly cross-platform: Windows, MacOS, and Linux
- Autocomplete SQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Tabbed interface, so you can multitask
- Sort and filter table data to find just what you need
- Sensible keyboard-shortcuts
- Save queries for later
- Query run-history, so you can find that one query you got working 3 days ago
- Great dark theme
- Import/export
- Backup/restore
- View data as JSON
- Loads more

## Our approach to UX

One of our frustrations with other open-source SQL editors and database managers is that they take a &#039;kitchen sink&#039; approach to features, adding so many features that the UI becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. We wanted a good looking, open source SQL workbench that&#039;s powerful, but also easy to use. We couldn&#039;t find one, so we created Beekeeper Studio!

Generally our guiding star is to only build software that &#039;feels good&#039; to use. That means at the very least we value Beekeeper being fast, straightforward to use, and modern. If a new feature compromises this vision, we kill it.


## Supporting Beekeeper Studio

We love working on Beekeeper Studio, and we&#039;d love to keep growing and improving it forever. To do that I need your help.

The best way to support Beekeeper Studio is to purchase a paid [license](https://beekeeperstudio.io/pricing). Every purchase directly supports our work on Beekeeper Studio.

If you&#039;re at a business and using Beekeeper Studio for your job, you should probably get your boss to [buy you a license](https://beekeeperstudio.io/pricing).

If you can&#039;t afford a license, please use the free version, that&#039;s why we make a free version!

Thank you for your continued support!


## Documentation

Check out [docs.beekeeperstudio.io](https://docs.beekeeperstudio.io) for user guides, FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and more.

## License

Beekeeper Studio Community Edition (the code in this repository) is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

Beekeeper Studio Ultimate Edition contains extra features and is licensed under a [commercial end user agreement (EULA)](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/commercial-eula/).

Beekeeper Studio&#039;s trademarks (words marks and logos) are not open source. See our [trademark guidelines](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/trademark/) for more information.

## Trademark Guidelines

Trademarks can be complicated with open source projects, so we have adapted a set of standard guidelines for using our trademarks that are common to many open source projects.

If you are just using the Beekeeper Studio app, and you are not forking or distributing Beekeeper Studio code in any way, these probably don&#039;t apply to you.

👉 [Beekeeper Studio Trademark Guidelines](https://beekeeperstudio.io/legal/trademark/)

## Contributing to Beekeeper Studio

We love *any* community engagement. Even if you&#039;re complaining because you don&#039;t like something about the app!


### Contributor Agreements

- Building an inclusive and welcoming community is important to us, so please follow our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) as you engage with the project.

- By contributing to the project you agree to the terms of our [contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Contribute without coding

We have you covered, read our [guide to contributing in 10 minutes without coding](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/issues/287).

### Compiling and Running Beekeeper Studio Locally

Want to write some code and improve Beekeeper Studio? Getting set-up is easy on Mac, Linux, or Windows.

```bash
# First: Install NodeJS 20, NPM, and Yarn
# ...

# 1. Fork the Beekeeper Studio Repo (click fork button at top right of this screen)
# 2. Check out your fork:
git clone git@github.com:&lt;your-username&gt;/beekeeper-studio.git beekeeper-studio
cd beekeeper-studio/
yarn install # installs dependencies


# Now you can start the app:
yarn run electron:serve ## the app will now start
```

**If you get `error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error`, you&#039;ll have to update openssl.**

- On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade openssl
```

- On CentOS/RHEL:
```
sudo yum update openssl
```

- On macOS (using Homebrew):
```
brew update
brew upgrade openssl
```

### Where to make changes?

This repo is now a monorepo, we have several places with code, but only really a couple of important entry points.

All app code lives in `apps/studio`, some shared code lives in `shared/src`. This is shared with other apps.

Beekeeper Studio has two entry points:
- `background.js` - this is the electron-side code that controls native things like showing windows.
- `main.js` - this is the entry point for the Vue.js app. You can follow the Vue component breadcrumbs from `App.vue` to find the screen you need.

**Generally we have two &#039;screens&#039;:**
- ConnectionInterface - connecting to a DB
- CoreInterface - interacting with a database

### How to submit a change?


- Push your changes to your repository and open a Pull Request from our github page (this page)
- Make sure to write some notes about what your change does! A gif is always welcome for visual changes.

## Maintainer notes (casual readers can ignore this stuff)

### Upgrading Electron Gotchas

This is always a total pain and will break the build 9/10.

Some things you need to consider when upgrading Electron:

1. Does it use a different node version. Eg Electron-18 uses node 14, 22 uses node 16. So everyone needs to upgrade
2. Does node-abi need to be upgraded to be able to understand the electron version? This is used in the build to fetch prebuilt packages. You need to upgrade this in root/package.json#resolutions
3. Were any APIs deprecated or removed? Make sure all features that interact with the Electron APIs still work, stuff like - selecting a file, maximizing a window, running a query, etc.


### Release Process

1. Up the version number in package.json
2. Replace `build/release-notes.md` with the latest release notes. Follow the format that is there.
  - run `git log &lt;last-tag&gt;..HEAD --oneline | grep &#039;Merge pull&#039;` to find PRs merged
2. Commit
3. Push to master
4. Create a tag `git tag v&lt;version&gt;`. It must start with a &#039;v&#039;
5. `git push origin &lt;tagname&gt;`
  - Now wait for the build/publish action to complete on Github
6. Push the new release live
  - Go to the new &#039;draft&#039; release on the releases tab of github, edit the notes, publish
  - Log into snapcraft.io, drag the uploaded release into the &#039;stable&#039; channel for each architecture.

This should also publish the latest docs

Post Release:
1. Copy release notes to a blog post, post on website
2. Tweet link
3. Share on LinkedIn
4. Send to mailing list on SendInBlue


## Big Thanks

Beekeeper Studio wouldn&#039;t exist without [Sqlectron-core](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core), the core database libraries from the [Sqlectron project](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui). Beekeeper Studio started as an experimental fork of that repository. A big thanks to @maxcnunes and the rest of the Sqlectron community.

&gt; Fluent UI React is shipping its v9 final stable release. Visit the [Fluent UI React v9 Release page on the wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Fluent-UI-React-v9-Release) to learn more about the upcoming release schedule.

Fluent UI web represents a collection of utilities, React components, and Web Components for building web applications.

This repo is home to 3 separate projects today. Combining Fluent UI React v9 components with Fluent UI React v8 or v0 components is possible and allows gradual migration to Fluent UI v9.

The following table will help you navigate the 3 projects and understand their differences.

## Looking for Office UI Fabric React?

The **Office UI Fabric React** project has evolved to **Fluent UI**.

The `office-ui-fabric-react` repo is now this repo (`fluentui` in the Microsoft organization)! The name change should not disrupt any current Fabric usage, repo clones, pull requests, or issue reporting. Links should redirect to the new location. The library formerly known as `office-ui-fabric-react` is now available as `@fluentui/react` (see above table for more information).

We have a lot in store for Fluent UI - [Read our announcement here.](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/)

## Looking for Fluent UI React Northstar?

Fluent UI React Northstar has been superseded by Fluent UI React Components v9. For more details about Fluent UI React Northstar, see its [README.md](/packages/fluentui/README.md).

## Getting started

- 💬 Comment on the issue if you are willing to take it up, and link the pull request with the issue.
- 🏷️ Tag `@ohcnetwork/care-fe-code-reviewers` for faster resolution.
- 📸 Attach screenshots in the pull requests showing the changes made in the UI.

#### Install the required dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

#### First-time setup

For first-time setup, run the following command to generate the pluginMap and install plugin configurations:

```sh
npm run setup
```

#### 🏃 Run the app in development mode

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once the development server has started, open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. The page will be automatically reloaded when you make edits and save. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### 🔑 Staging API Credentials

Authenticate to staging API with any of the following credentials

```yaml
- username: devdistrictadmin
  password: Coronasafe@123
  role: Administrator

- username: staffdev
  password: Coronasafe@123
  role: Nurse

- username: doctordev
  password: Coronasafe@123
  role: Doctor
```

#### Contributing to CARE

- Create a branch with branch name of the format `issues/{issue#}/{short-name}` (example `issues/7001/edit-prescriptions`) from the latest [`develop`](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/tree/develop) branch when starting to work on an issue.
- Once the changes are pushed to the branch, make a pull request with a meaningful title (example: &quot;💊 Adds support for editing prescriptions&quot; #6369)
- Ensure the issue number is mentioned in the PR with a closing tag by following the PR body template. (Refer: [Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword))
- Once the code review is done, the PR will be marked with a &quot;Needs Testing&quot; label where it&#039;ll be queued for QA testing.
- Once tested, the PR would be marked with a &quot;Tested&quot; label and would be queued for merge.

### Translations

All strings must be encased in i18n translations. New translation strings must be specified in `src`-&gt;`Locale`-&gt;`en`. Do not add translations for languages other than english through pull requests. Other language translations can be contributed through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ohccarefe)

### Testing

To ensure the quality of our pull requests, we use a variety of tools:

- **Automated E2E Testing:** We use Cypress for end-to-end testing to automatically verify the functionality and performance of our code.
- **Manual Real Device Testing:** We use BrowserStack to manually test our code on real devices, ensuring compatibility and functionality across different platforms and browsers.

#### 🧪 Run cypress tests

To run cypress tests locally, you&#039;ll need to setup the backend to run locally and load dummy data required for cypress to the database. See [docs](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care#self-hosting).

Once backend is running locally, you&#039;ll have to ensure your local front-end is connected to local backend, by setting the `REACT_CARE_API_URL` env.

```env
#.env
REACT_CARE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Once done, start the development server by running

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once development server is running, then run the cypress tests in either of the ways described below.

```sh
npm run cypress:run        # To run all tests in headless mode.
```

```sh
npm run cypress:run:gui    # To run all tests in headed mode.
```

```sh
npm run cypress:open       # To debug and run tests individually.
```

- Failed test screenshots are saved in `cypress/screenshots`
- All test videos are saved in `cypress/videos`

- [Swagger API Documentation](https://careapi.ohc.network/swagger/)
- [Testing Documentation](https://docs.coronasafe.network/care-testing-documentation/)

## 🚀 Production

#### Build the app for production

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### Start a production `http-server`

```sh
npm run preview
```

Starts a production http-server in local to run the project with Service worker.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

**🚀 Your app is ready to be deployed!**

The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software development
framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

The CDK is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/))
  * We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
* Python ([Python ≥ 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Java ([Java ≥ 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven ≥ 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
* .NET ([.NET ≥ 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
* Go ([Go ≥ 1.16.4](https://golang.org/))

Third-party Language Deprecation: language version is only supported until its EOL (End Of Life) shared by the vendor or community and is subject to change with prior notice.

-------

Developers use the [CDK framework] in one of the
supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which
are composed together into [stacks], forming a &quot;CDK app&quot;.

They then use the [AWS CDK CLI] to interact with their CDK app. The CLI allows developers to
synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and &quot;diff&quot;
against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The [AWS Construct Library] includes a module for each
AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of
how to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and
glue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals
on AWS.

Modules in the AWS Construct Library are designated Experimental while we build
them; experimental modules may have breaking API changes in any release.  After
a module is designated Stable, it adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
and only major releases can have breaking changes. Each module&#039;s stability designation
is available on its Overview page in the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html).
For more information, see [Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/reference.html#versioning)
in the CDK Developer Guide.

## Getting Started

For a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#hello_world_tutorial) in the AWS CDK [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

### At a glance

Install or update the [AWS CDK CLI] from npm (requires [Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/)). We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)

```sh
npm i -g aws-cdk
```

(See [Manual Installation](./MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md) for installing the CDK from a signed .zip file).

Initialize a project:

```sh
mkdir hello-cdk
cd hello-cdk
cdk init sample-app --language=typescript
```

This creates a sample project looking like this:

```ts
export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, &#039;HelloCdkQueue&#039;, {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, &#039;HelloCdkTopic&#039;);

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

Deploy this to your account:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

Use the `cdk` command-line toolkit to interact with your project:

* `cdk deploy`: deploys your app into an AWS account
* `cdk synth`: synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template for your app
* `cdk diff`: compares your app with the deployed stack

## Getting Help

The best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. You can open an [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose) and choose from one of our templates for bug reports, feature requests, documentation issues, or guidance.

If you have a support plan with AWS Support, you can also create a new [support case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).

You may also find help on these community resources:

* Look through the [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html) or [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide)
* The #aws-cdk Slack channel in [cdk.dev](https://cdk.dev)
* Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cdk)
  and tag it with `aws-cdk`

## Roadmap

The AWS CDK Roadmap lets developers know about our upcoming features and priorities to help them plan how to best leverage the CDK and identify opportunities to contribute to the project. See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for more information and FAQs.

## Contributing

We welcome community contributions and pull requests. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to set up a development
environment and submit code.

## Metrics collection

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the

## Intro

This boilerplate helps you create Chrome/Firefox extensions using React and Typescript. It improves
the build speed and development experience by using Vite and Turborepo.

## Features

- [React19](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Chrome Extensions Manifest Version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
- [Custom i18n package](/packages/i18n/)
- [Custom HMR (Hot Module Rebuild) plugin](/packages/hmr/)
- [End-to-end testing with WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)

## Getting started

1. When you&#039;re using Windows run this:
    - `git config --global core.eol lf`
    - `git config --global core.autocrlf input`

   **This will set the EOL (End of line) character to be the same as on Linux/macOS. Without this, our bash script won&#039;t
   work, and you will have conflicts with developers on Linux/macOS.**
2. Clone this repository.( ```git clone https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite``` )
3. Ensure your node version is &gt;= than in `.nvmrc` file, recommend to
   use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#intro)
4. Edit `/packages/i18n/locales/`{your locale(s)}/`messages.json`
5. In the objects `extensionDescription` and `extensionName`, change the `message` fields (leave `description` alone)
6. In `/.package.json`, change the `version` to the desired version of your extension.
7. Install pnpm globally: `npm install -g pnpm` (ensure your node version &gt;= 22.12.0)
8. Run `pnpm install`

Then, depending on the target browser:

### For Chrome: &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started-chrome&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev` (on Windows, you should run as administrator;
      see [issue#456](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/456))
    - Prod: `pnpm build`
2. Open in browser - `chrome://extensions`
3. Check - &lt;kbd&gt;Developer mode&lt;/kbd&gt;
4. Click - &lt;kbd&gt;Load unpacked&lt;/kbd&gt; in the upper left corner
5. Select the `dist` directory from the boilerplate project

### For Firefox: &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started-firefox&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev:firefox`
    - Prod: `pnpm build:firefox`
2. Open in browser - `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click - &lt;kbd&gt;Load Temporary Add-on...&lt;/kbd&gt; in the upper right corner
4. Select the `./dist/manifest.json` file from the boilerplate project

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; In Firefox, you load add-ons in temporary mode. That means they&#039;ll disappear after each browser close. You have to
&gt; load the add-on on every browser launch.

## Install dependency for turborepo: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### For root: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency-for-root&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run `pnpm i &lt;package&gt; -w`

### For module: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency-for-module&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run `pnpm i &lt;package&gt; -F &lt;module name&gt;`

`package` - Name of the package you want to install e.g. `nodemon` \
`module-name` - You can find it inside each `package.json` under the key `name`, e.g. `@extension/content-script`, you
can use only `content-script` without `@extension/` prefix

## How do I disable modules I&#039;m not using?

```bash
$ pnpm module-manager
```

Read: [Module Manager](packages/module-manager/README.md)

## Environment variables

Read: [Env Documentation](packages/env/README.md)

## Boilerplate structure &lt;a name=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Chrome extension &lt;a name=&quot;structure-chrome-extension&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The extension lives in the `chrome-extension` directory and includes the following files:

- [`manifest.ts`](chrome-extension/manifest.ts) - script that outputs the `manifest.json`
- [`src/background`](chrome-extension/src/background) - [background script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/background_pages/)
  (`background.service_worker` in manifest.json)
- [`public`](chrome-extension/public/) - icons referenced in the manifest; content CSS for user&#039;s page injection

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; To facilitate development, the boilerplate is configured to &quot;Read and change all your data on all websites&quot;.
&gt; In production, it&#039;s best practice to limit the premissions to only the strictly necessary websites. See
&gt; [Declaring permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions)
&gt; and edit `manifest.js` accordingly.

### Pages &lt;a name=&quot;structure-pages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Code that is transpiled to be part of the extension lives in the [pages](pages/) directory.

- [
  `content`](pages/content/) - [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts)
  (`content_scripts` in manifest.json)
- [`content-ui`](pages/content-ui) - React UI rendered in the current page (you can see it at the very bottom when you
  get started)
  (`content_scripts` in manifest.json)
- [
  `content-runtime`](pages/content-runtime/src/) - [injected content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality);
  this can be injected from `popup` like standard `content`
- [
  `devtools`](pages/devtools/) - [extend the browser DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools#creating)
  (`devtools_page` in manifest.json)
- [
  `devtools-panel`](pages/devtools-panel/) - [DevTools panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/panels)
  for [devtools](pages/devtools/src/index.ts)
- [
  `new-tab`](pages/new-tab/) - [override the default New Tab page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/override-chrome-pages)
  (`chrome_url_overrides.newtab` in manifest.json)
- [`options`](pages/options/) - [options page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page)
  (`options_page` in manifest.json)
- [`popup`](pages/popup/) - [popup](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/action#popup) shown when
  clicking the extension in the toolbar
  (`action.default_popup` in manifest.json)
- [
  `side-panel`](pages/side-panel/) - [sidepanel (Chrome 114+)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel)
  (`side_panel.default_path` in manifest.json)

### Packages &lt;a name=&quot;structure-packages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Some shared packages:

- `dev-utils` - utilities for Chrome extension development (manifest-parser, logger)
- `env` - exports object which contain all environment variables from `.env` and dynamically declared
- `hmr` - custom HMR plugin for Vite, injection script for reload/refresh, HMR dev-server
- `i18n` - custom internationalization package; provides i18n function with type safety and other validation
- `shared` - shared code for the entire project (types, constants, custom hooks, components etc.)
- `storage` - helpers for easier integration with [storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage), e.g. local/session storages
- `tailwind-config` - shared Tailwind config for entire project
- `tsconfig` - shared tsconfig for the entire project
- `ui` - function to merge your Tailwind config with the global one; you can save components here
- `vite-config` - shared Vite config for the entire project

Other useful packages:

- `zipper` - run `pnpm zip` to pack the `dist` folder into `extension-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.zip` inside the newly created
  `dist-zip`
- `module-manager` - run `pnpm module-manager` to enable/disable modules
- `e2e` - run `pnpm e2e` for end-to-end tests of your zipped extension on different browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Hot module reload seems to have frozen

If saving source files doesn&#039;t cause the extension HMR code to trigger a reload of the browser page, try this:

1. Ctrl+C the development server and restart it (`pnpm run dev`)
2. If you get a [`grpc` error](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/612),
   [kill the
   `turbo` process](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/612#issuecomment-2518982339)
   and run `pnpm dev` again.

[English](README.EN.md) | 简体中文

NoteGen 是一款专注于`记录`和`写作`的跨端 AI 笔记应用，基于 `Tauri` 开发。

| 记录 | 写作 |

## 特性

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; NoteGen 目前还处于开发阶段，还存在着许多的不足和缺陷。

NoteGen 的核心理念是将记录、写作和 AI 结合使用，三者相辅相成。记录功能可以帮助用户快速捕捉和整理碎片化知识。整理功能是连接记录和写作的桥梁，可将持续记录的内容整理成一篇可读的笔记，辅助用户完成从零到一的创作过程，如果 AI 整理的结果无法满足你的要求，那么你可以使用写作功能自行去完善。

### 记录

记录方式支持：

1. 🖥️ 截图记录，通过截图，用户可以快速捕捉和记录碎片化知识，尤其是在遇到无法进行文本复制的情况下。
2. 📄 文本记录，可以复制文本或者手动输入一些简短的内容作为一次记录。
3. 🖼️ 插图记录，可以在笔记生成时，自动插入到合适的位置。
4. 📇 文件记录，识别 PDF、md、html、txt 等文件内容，进行文字记录。
5. 🔗 链接记录（待实现），使用爬虫进行页面内容识别与记录。
6. 📷 拍照记录（待实现）功能类似于插图记录，调用相机记录，适合未来移动端。

辅助记录：

- 🏷️ 自定义标签，更好地归类和区分不同的记录场景。
- 🤖 AI 对话，默认关联当前标签下的记录，你也可以手动去关联写作内的任何文章。
- 📋 剪贴板识别，在你进行图片或文本复制后，会自动识别剪贴板中的图片或文本。
- 💾 整理，当你已经完成了一系列的记录之后，可以尝试让 AI 帮你整理为一篇文章。

### 写作

- 🗂 文件管理器，支持本地和 Github 仓库的文件和文件夹的管理，支持无限层级目录。
- 📝 支持所见即所得、即时渲染、分屏预览三种模式。
- 📅 版本控制，如果你开启了同步功能，可以在历史记录中回溯历史上传过的记录。
- 🤖 AI 辅助，支持问答、续写、优化、精简、翻译等功能，且可以随时将记录插入到文章任何位置。
- 🏞️ 图床，直接复制图片粘贴在 Markdown 编辑器中，将自动将此图片上传至图床，并转换为 Markdown 图片链接。
- 🛠️ HTML、Markdown转换，复制浏览器的内容，将自动转换为 Markdown 格式。

### 辅助

- 📦 大模型支持，内置多种大模型配置，支持自定义，随意切换。
- 👁️ OCR，可以辅助识别图片内的文字。
- 🏗️ 整理模板，可自定义模板，方便 AI 对不同类型的内容进行定制化整理。
- 🔎 全局搜索，可以快速搜索并跳转至指定的内容。
- 🌃 图床管理，可以方便的管理图床仓库的内容。
- 💎 主题与外观，支持深色主题，支持 Markdown、代码等外观设置。

## 如何使用？

### 下载

目前支持 Mac、Windows、Linux，得益于 Tauri2 的跨平台能力，未来将支持 IOS、Android。

[下载 NoteGen (alpha)](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/releases)

### 入门指南

如果你还不了解 NoteGen，你可以阅读使用文档，其中包含了快速上手指南：

[NoteGen 使用文档](https://codexu.github.io/note-gen-help/)

### AI 模型接入

目前已支持自定义模型配置，内置 ChatGPT、ChatAnyWhere、Ollama、LM Studio、豆包、通义千问、Kimi、DeepSeek，支持所有以 OpenAI 协议的模型，未来将逐步支持其他协议。

&gt; 本地模型目前调用可能存在 403 报错，目前在等待 http-plugin 的解决办法，开发环境中不会出现此问题。

[话题讨论 - 关于模型接入](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/discussions/26)

### 同步与图床

NoteGen 支持离线存储，所有笔记均以 Markdown 格式存储。为了保证笔记的安全性，你可以选择将其同步到 Github 私有仓库，配置同步后，同时支持了 Github 图床功能，未来还将支持其他图床的独立配置。
