## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

## Notification Workflows as Code
For API documentation and reference, please visit [Echo API Reference](https://docs.novu.co/echo/quickstart?utm_campaign=github-readme).

```ts

client.workflow(&#039;comment-on-post&#039;, async ({step, subscriber}) =&gt; {
  const inAppResponse = await step.inApp(&#039;in-app-step&#039;, async (inputs) =&gt; {
    return {
      body: renderReactComponent(inputs)
    };
  }, {
    inputSchema: {
      // ...JSON Schema or ZOD/Ajv/Class Validators definition
    }
  });

  // Novu Worker Engine will manage the state and durability of each step in isolation
  const { events } = await step.digest(&#039;1 day&#039;);

  await step.email(&#039;email-step&#039;, async () =&gt; {
    return {
      subject: &#039;E-mail Subject&#039;,
      body: renderReactEmail(&lt;ReactEmailComponent events={digestedEvents} /&gt;);
    }
  }, {
    // Step-level inputs defined in code and controlled in the novu Cloud UI by a Non-Technical Team member
    inputSchema: {
      // ...JSON Schema
    },
    providers: {
      sendgrid: async (inputs) =&gt; {
        // Echo runs as part of your application, so you have access to your database or resources

        return {
          to: email,
          ipPoolName: &#039;custom-pool&#039;
        };
      }
    },
    skip: () =&gt; {
      // Write custom skip logic
      return inAppResponse.seen || subscriber.isOnline;
    }
  });
// Define your workflow trigger payload using json schema and custom validation;
}, {
  payloadSchema: {
    // ...JSON Schema
  }
});

```

## Embeddable Notification Center

Using the Novu API and admin panel, you can easily add a real-time notification center to your web app without building it yourself. You can use our [React](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/react/get-started?utm_campaign=github-readme) / [Vue](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/vue?utm_campaign=github-readme) / [Angular](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/angular?utm_campaign=github-readme) components or an [iframe embed](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/iframe?utm_campaign=github-readme), as well as a [Web component](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/web-component?utm_campaign=github-readme).

[English](README.EN.md) | 简体中文

NoteGen 是一款专注于`记录`和`写作`的跨端 AI 笔记应用，基于 `Tauri` 开发。

| 记录 | 写作 |
| ---- | ---- |
| ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c605f4b-f675-467b-90e1-e039c1812d7b) | ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0b2754a-e8cc-4661-a07f-0114a2a09d38) |

## 特性

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; NoteGen 目前还处于开发阶段，还存在着许多的不足和缺陷。

NoteGen 的核心理念是将记录、写作和 AI 结合使用，三者相辅相成。记录功能可以帮助用户快速捕捉和整理碎片化知识。整理功能是连接记录和写作的桥梁，可将持续记录的内容整理成一篇可读的笔记，辅助用户完成从零到一的创作过程，如果 AI 整理的结果无法满足你的要求，那么你可以使用写作功能自行去完善。

### 记录

记录方式支持：

1. 🖥️ 截图记录，通过截图，用户可以快速捕捉和记录碎片化知识，尤其是在遇到无法进行文本复制的情况下。
2. 📄 文本记录，可以复制文本或者手动输入一些简短的内容作为一次记录。
3. 🖼️ 插图记录，可以在笔记生成时，自动插入到合适的位置。
4. 📇 文件记录，识别 PDF、md、html、txt 等文件内容，进行文字记录。
5. 🔗 链接记录（待实现），使用爬虫进行页面内容识别与记录。
6. 📷 拍照记录（待实现）功能类似于插图记录，调用相机记录，适合未来移动端。

辅助记录：

- 🏷️ 自定义标签，更好地归类和区分不同的记录场景。
- 🤖 AI 对话，默认关联当前标签下的记录，你也可以手动去关联写作内的任何文章。
- 📋 剪贴板识别，在你进行图片或文本复制后，会自动识别剪贴板中的图片或文本。
- 💾 整理，当你已经完成了一系列的记录之后，可以尝试让 AI 帮你整理为一篇文章。

### 写作

- 🗂 文件管理器，支持本地和 Github 仓库的文件和文件夹的管理，支持无限层级目录。
- 📝 支持所见即所得、即时渲染、分屏预览三种模式。
- 📅 版本控制，如果你开启了同步功能，可以在历史记录中回溯历史上传过的记录。
- 🤖 AI 辅助，支持问答、续写、优化、精简、翻译等功能，且可以随时将记录插入到文章任何位置。
- 🏞️ 图床，直接复制图片粘贴在 Markdown 编辑器中，将自动将此图片上传至图床，并转换为 Markdown 图片链接。
- 🛠️ HTML、Markdown转换，复制浏览器的内容，将自动转换为 Markdown 格式。

### 辅助

- 📦 大模型支持，内置多种大模型配置，支持自定义，随意切换。
- 👁️ OCR，可以辅助识别图片内的文字。
- 🏗️ 整理模板，可自定义模板，方便 AI 对不同类型的内容进行定制化整理。
- 🔎 全局搜索，可以快速搜索并跳转至指定的内容。
- 🌃 图床管理，可以方便的管理图床仓库的内容。
- 💎 主题与外观，支持深色主题，支持 Markdown、代码等外观设置。

## 如何使用？

### 下载

目前支持 Mac、Windows、Linux，得益于 Tauri2 的跨平台能力，未来将支持 IOS、Android。

[下载 NoteGen (alpha)](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/releases)

### 入门指南

如果你还不了解 NoteGen，你可以阅读使用文档，其中包含了快速上手指南：

[NoteGen 使用文档](https://codexu.github.io/note-gen-help/)

### AI 模型接入

目前已支持自定义模型配置，内置 ChatGPT、ChatAnyWhere、Ollama、LM Studio、豆包、通义千问、Kimi、DeepSeek，支持所有以 OpenAI 协议的模型，未来将逐步支持其他协议。

&gt; 本地模型目前调用可能存在 403 报错，目前在等待 http-plugin 的解决办法，开发环境中不会出现此问题。

[话题讨论 - 关于模型接入](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/discussions/26)

### 同步与图床

NoteGen 支持离线存储，所有笔记均以 Markdown 格式存储。为了保证笔记的安全性，你可以选择将其同步到 Github 私有仓库，配置同步后，同时支持了 Github 图床功能，未来还将支持其他图床的独立配置。

## Getting started

1. When you&#039;re using Windows run this:
    - `git config --global core.eol lf`
    - `git config --global core.autocrlf input`

   **This will set the EOL (End of line) character to be the same as on Linux/macOS. Without this, our bash script won&#039;t
   work, and you will have conflicts with developers on Linux/macOS.**
2. Clone this repository.( ```git clone https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite``` )
3. Ensure your node version is &gt;= than in `.nvmrc` file, recommend to
   use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#intro)
4. Edit `/packages/i18n/locales/`{your locale(s)}/`messages.json`
5. In the objects `extensionDescription` and `extensionName`, change the `message` fields (leave `description` alone)
6. In `/.package.json`, change the `version` to the desired version of your extension.
7. Install pnpm globally: `npm install -g pnpm` (ensure your node version &gt;= 22.12.0)
8. Run `pnpm install`

Then, depending on the target browser:

### For Chrome: &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started-chrome&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev` (on Windows, you should run as administrator;
      see [issue#456](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/456))
    - Prod: `pnpm build`
2. Open in browser - `chrome://extensions`
3. Check - &lt;kbd&gt;Developer mode&lt;/kbd&gt;
4. Click - &lt;kbd&gt;Load unpacked&lt;/kbd&gt; in the upper left corner
5. Select the `dist` directory from the boilerplate project

### For Firefox: &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started-firefox&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev:firefox`
    - Prod: `pnpm build:firefox`
2. Open in browser - `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click - &lt;kbd&gt;Load Temporary Add-on...&lt;/kbd&gt; in the upper right corner
4. Select the `./dist/manifest.json` file from the boilerplate project

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; In Firefox, you load add-ons in temporary mode. That means they&#039;ll disappear after each browser close. You have to
&gt; load the add-on on every browser launch.

## Install dependency for turborepo: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### For root: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency-for-root&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run `pnpm i &lt;package&gt; -w`

### For module: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency-for-module&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run `pnpm i &lt;package&gt; -F &lt;module name&gt;`

`package` - Name of the package you want to install e.g. `nodemon` \
`module-name` - You can find it inside each `package.json` under the key `name`, e.g. `@extension/content-script`, you
can use only `content-script` without `@extension/` prefix

## How do I disable modules I&#039;m not using?

```bash
$ pnpm module-manager
```

Read: [Module Manager](packages/module-manager/README.md)

## Environment variables

Read: [Env Documentation](packages/env/README.md)

## Boilerplate structure &lt;a name=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Chrome extension &lt;a name=&quot;structure-chrome-extension&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The extension lives in the `chrome-extension` directory and includes the following files:

- [`manifest.ts`](chrome-extension/manifest.ts) - script that outputs the `manifest.json`
- [`src/background`](chrome-extension/src/background) - [background script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/background_pages/)
  (`background.service_worker` in manifest.json)
- [`public`](chrome-extension/public/) - icons referenced in the manifest; content CSS for user&#039;s page injection

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; To facilitate development, the boilerplate is configured to &quot;Read and change all your data on all websites&quot;.
&gt; In production, it&#039;s best practice to limit the premissions to only the strictly necessary websites. See
&gt; [Declaring permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions)
&gt; and edit `manifest.js` accordingly.

### Pages &lt;a name=&quot;structure-pages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Code that is transpiled to be part of the extension lives in the [pages](pages/) directory.

- [
  `content`](pages/content/) - [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts)
  (`content_scripts` in manifest.json)
- [`content-ui`](pages/content-ui) - React UI rendered in the current page (you can see it at the very bottom when you
  get started)
  (`content_scripts` in manifest.json)
- [
  `content-runtime`](pages/content-runtime/src/) - [injected content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality);
  this can be injected from `popup` like standard `content`
- [
  `devtools`](pages/devtools/) - [extend the browser DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools#creating)
  (`devtools_page` in manifest.json)
- [
  `devtools-panel`](pages/devtools-panel/) - [DevTools panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/panels)
  for [devtools](pages/devtools/src/index.ts)
- [
  `new-tab`](pages/new-tab/) - [override the default New Tab page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/override-chrome-pages)
  (`chrome_url_overrides.newtab` in manifest.json)
- [`options`](pages/options/) - [options page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page)
  (`options_page` in manifest.json)
- [`popup`](pages/popup/) - [popup](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/action#popup) shown when
  clicking the extension in the toolbar
  (`action.default_popup` in manifest.json)
- [
  `side-panel`](pages/side-panel/) - [sidepanel (Chrome 114+)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel)
  (`side_panel.default_path` in manifest.json)

### Packages &lt;a name=&quot;structure-packages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Some shared packages:

- `dev-utils` - utilities for Chrome extension development (manifest-parser, logger)
- `env` - exports object which contain all environment variables from `.env` and dynamically declared
- `hmr` - custom HMR plugin for Vite, injection script for reload/refresh, HMR dev-server
- `i18n` - custom internationalization package; provides i18n function with type safety and other validation
- `shared` - shared code for the entire project (types, constants, custom hooks, components etc.)
- `storage` - helpers for easier integration with [storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage), e.g. local/session storages
- `tailwind-config` - shared Tailwind config for entire project
- `tsconfig` - shared tsconfig for the entire project
- `ui` - function to merge your Tailwind config with the global one; you can save components here
- `vite-config` - shared Vite config for the entire project

Other useful packages:

- `zipper` - run `pnpm zip` to pack the `dist` folder into `extension-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.zip` inside the newly created
  `dist-zip`
- `module-manager` - run `pnpm module-manager` to enable/disable modules
- `e2e` - run `pnpm e2e` for end-to-end tests of your zipped extension on different browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Hot module reload seems to have frozen

If saving source files doesn&#039;t cause the extension HMR code to trigger a reload of the browser page, try this:

1. Ctrl+C the development server and restart it (`pnpm run dev`)
2. If you get a [`grpc` error](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/612),
   [kill the
   `turbo` process](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/612#issuecomment-2518982339)
   and run `pnpm dev` again.

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React is an excellent tool for building front-end applications. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture that developers can follow, it often leads to a messy, inconsistent, and over-complicated codebase.

This repo attempts to present a way of creating React applications using some of the best tools in the ecosystem with a good project structure that scales very well. Based on my experience working with a lot of different codebases, this architecture turns out to be the most effective.

The goal here is to serve as a collection of resources and best practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and help developers write better applications.

Feel free to explore the sample app codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

## What makes a React application &quot;bulletproof&quot;?

This repo doesn&#039;t aim to be a silver bullet for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.

To get most out of it, do not get limited by the technologies used in this sample app, but rather focus on the principles and the concepts that are being presented here. The tools and libraries used here are just a suggestion, you can always replace them with something that fits your needs better. Sometimes, your project might require a slightly different approach, and that&#039;s totally fine.

&gt; Fluent UI React is shipping its v9 final stable release. Visit the [Fluent UI React v9 Release page on the wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Fluent-UI-React-v9-Release) to learn more about the upcoming release schedule.

Fluent UI web represents a collection of utilities, React components, and Web Components for building web applications.

This repo is home to 3 separate projects today. Combining Fluent UI React v9 components with Fluent UI React v8 or v0 components is possible and allows gradual migration to Fluent UI v9.

The following table will help you navigate the 3 projects and understand their differences.

## Looking for Office UI Fabric React?

The **Office UI Fabric React** project has evolved to **Fluent UI**.

The `office-ui-fabric-react` repo is now this repo (`fluentui` in the Microsoft organization)! The name change should not disrupt any current Fabric usage, repo clones, pull requests, or issue reporting. Links should redirect to the new location. The library formerly known as `office-ui-fabric-react` is now available as `@fluentui/react` (see above table for more information).

We have a lot in store for Fluent UI - [Read our announcement here.](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/)

## Looking for Fluent UI React Northstar?

Fluent UI React Northstar has been superseded by Fluent UI React Components v9. For more details about Fluent UI React Northstar, see its [README.md](/packages/fluentui/README.md).

## Introduction

OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. It has been created in order to structure, store, organize and visualize technical and non-technical information about cyber threats.

The structuration of the data is performed using a knowledge schema based on the [STIX2 standards](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/). It has been designed as a modern web application including a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org) and an UX oriented frontend. Also, OpenCTI can be integrated with other tools and applications such as [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP), [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive), [MITRE ATT&amp;CK](https://github.com/mitre/cti), etc.

![Screenshot](./.github/img/screenshot.png &quot;Screenshot&quot;)

## Objective

The goal is to create a comprehensive tool allowing users to capitalize technical (such as TTPs and observables) and non-technical information (such as suggested attribution, victimology etc.) while linking each piece of information to its primary source (a report, a MISP event, etc.), with features such as links between each information, first and last seen dates, levels of confidence, etc. The tool is able to use the [MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org) (through a [dedicated connector](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors)) to help structure the data. The user can also choose to implement their own datasets.

Once data has been capitalized and processed by the analysts within OpenCTI, new relations may be inferred from existing ones to facilitate the understanding and the representation of this information. This allows the user to extract and leverage meaningful knowledge from the raw data.

OpenCTI not only allows [imports](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/import-automated/) but also [exports of data](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/feeds/) under different formats (CSV, STIX2 bundles, etc.). [Connectors](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76) are currently developed to accelerate interactions between the tool and other platforms.

## Editions of the platform

OpenCTI platform has 2 different editions: Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE). The purpose of the Enterprise Edition is to provide [additional and powerful features](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) which require specific investments in research and development. You can enable the Enterprise Edition directly in the settings of the platform.

* OpenCTI Community Edition, licensed under the [Apache 2, Version 2.0 license](LICENSE).
* OpenCTI Enterprise Edition, licensed under the [Enterprise Edition license](LICENSE).

To understand what OpenCTI Enterprise Edition brings in terms of features, just check the [Enterprise Editions page](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) on the Filigran website. You can also try this edition by enabling it in the settings of the platform.

## Documentation and demonstration

If you want to know more on OpenCTI, you can read the [documentation on the tool](https://docs.opencti.io). If you wish to discover how the OpenCTI platform is working, a [demonstration instance](https://demo.opencti.io) is available and open to everyone. This instance is reset every night and is based on reference data maintained by the OpenCTI developers.

## Releases download

The releases are available on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/releases). You can also access the [rolling release package](https://releases.opencti.io) generated from the master branch of the repository.

## About

### Authors

OpenCTI is a product designed and developed by the company [Filigran](https://filigran.io).

&lt;a href=&quot;https://filigran.io&quot; alt=&quot;Filigran&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./.github/img/logo_filigran.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Data Collection

#### Usage telemetry

To improve the features and the performances of OpenCTI, the platform collects anonymous statistical data related to its usage and health.

You can find all the details on collected data and associated usage in the [usage telemetry documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/reference/usage-telemetry/).

#### OpenStreetMap server

To provide OpenCTI users with cartography features, the platform uses a dedicated OpenStreetMap server (https://map.opencti.io). To monitor usage and adapt services performances, Filigran collects access log to this server (including IP addresses).

By using this server, you authorize Filigran to collect this information. Otherwise, you are free to deploy your own OpenStreetMap server and modify the platform configuration accordingly.

If you have started using the Filigran server and change your mind, you have the right to access, limit, rectify, erase and receive your data. To exercise your rights, please send your request to privacy@filigran.io.

## ⚠️ Why TriliumNext?

[The original Trilium project is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/issues/4620)

### Migrating from Trilium?

There are no special migration steps to migrate from a zadam/Trilium instance to a TriliumNext/Notes instance. Just upgrade your Trilium instance to the latest version and [install TriliumNext/Notes as usual](#-installation)

Versions up to and including [v0.90.4](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/releases/tag/v0.90.4) are compatible with the latest zadam/trilium version of [v0.63.7](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.63.7). Any later versions of TriliumNext have their sync versions incremented.
