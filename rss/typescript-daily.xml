[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/) is a suite of advanced React UI components for a wide range of complex use cases.
Each component provides best-in-class UX and DX, with sophisticated UX workflows for data-rich applications.
Components include the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree View.

MUI X extends the core functionality of [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/), but the advanced components also stand on their own and can be fully customized to meet the needs of any design system.

MUI X is **open-core**: [Community](#community-plan) components are MIT-licensed and free forever, while more advanced features and components require a [Pro](#pro-plan) or [Premium](#premium-plan) commercial license.
See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.

## Licensing

The MUI X team has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, starting with Material UI, and we&#039;re committed to the continued advancement of our open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
Learn more about [our stewardship ethos](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced components and features that can&#039;t reasonably be maintained by the open-source community alone.
These licenses make it possible for us to support a full-time staff of engineers.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it&#039;s only because we believe you won&#039;t find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

- ✨ **Start from an idea -&gt; copilot builds your multi-agent workflows**
   - E.g. &quot;Build me an assistant for a food delivery company to handle delivery status and missing items. Include the necessary tools.&quot;
- 🌐 **Connect MCP servers**
   - Add the MCP servers in settings -&gt; import the tools into Rowboat.     
- 📞 **Integrate into your app using the HTTP API or Python SDK**
   - Grab the project ID and generated API key from settings and use the API.

Powered by OpenAI&#039;s Agents SDK, Rowboat is the fastest way to build multi-agents!

## Quick start
1. Set your OpenAI key
      ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```
      
2. Clone the repository and start Rowboat
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rowboatlabs/rowboat.git
   cd rowboat
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Note: We have added native RAG support including file-uploads and URL scraping. See the [RAG](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_rag) section of our docs for this.

Note: See the [Using custom LLM providers](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/setup/#using-custom-llm-providers) section of our docs for using custom providers like OpenRouter and LiteLLM.

## Demo

#### Create a multi-agent assistant with MCP tools by chatting with Rowboat
[![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 00 25 31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a41622-8e0e-459f-becb-767503489866)](https://youtu.be/YRTCw9UHRbU)

## Integrate with Rowboat agents

There are 2 ways to integrate with the agents you create in Rowboat

1. HTTP API
   - You can use the API directly at [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/)
   - See [API Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_api/) for details
   ```bash
   curl --location &#039;http://localhost:3000/api/v1/&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;/chat&#039; \
   --header &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
   --header &#039;Authorization: Bearer &lt;API_KEY&gt;&#039; \
   --data &#039;{
       &quot;messages&quot;: [
           {
               &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
               &quot;content&quot;: &quot;tell me the weather in london in metric units&quot;
           }
       ],
       &quot;state&quot;: null
   }&#039;
   ```
   

2. Python SDK
   You can use the included Python SDK to interact with the Agents
   ```
   pip install rowboat
   ```

   See [SDK Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_sdk/) for details. Here is a quick example:
   ```python
   from rowboat import Client, StatefulChat
   from rowboat.schema import UserMessage, SystemMessage

   # Initialize the client
   client = Client(
       host=&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
       project_id=&quot;&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;&quot;,
       api_key=&quot;&lt;API_KEY&gt;&quot;
   )

   # Create a stateful chat session (recommended)
   chat = StatefulChat(client)
   response = chat.run(&quot;What&#039;s the weather in London?&quot;)
   print(response)

   # Or use the low-level client API
   messages = [
       SystemMessage(role=&#039;system&#039;, content=&quot;You are a helpful assistant&quot;),
       UserMessage(role=&#039;user&#039;, content=&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;)
   ]
   
   # Get response
   response = client.chat(messages=messages)
   print(response.messages[-1].content)
   ```

The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software development
framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using
the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of
infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your
infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

The CDK is available in the following languages:

* JavaScript, TypeScript ([Node.js &gt;= 20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
  * We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
* Python ([Python ≥ 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Java ([Java ≥ 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven ≥ 3.5.4](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
* .NET ([.NET ≥ 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
* Go ([Go ≥ 1.16.4](https://golang.org/))

Third-party Language Deprecation: language version is only supported until its EOL (End Of Life) shared by the vendor or community and is subject to change with prior notice.

-------

Developers use the [CDK framework] in one of the
supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [constructs], which
are composed together into [stacks], forming a &quot;CDK app&quot;.

They then use the [AWS CDK CLI] to interact with their CDK app. The CLI allows developers to
synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and &quot;diff&quot;
against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.

The [AWS Construct Library] includes a module for each
AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of
how to use AWS. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and
glue-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals
on AWS.

Modules in the AWS Construct Library are designated Experimental while we build
them; experimental modules may have breaking API changes in any release.  After
a module is designated Stable, it adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
and only major releases can have breaking changes. Each module&#039;s stability designation
is available on its Overview page in the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html).
For more information, see [Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/reference.html#versioning)
in the CDK Developer Guide.

## Getting Started

For a detailed walkthrough, see the [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#hello_world_tutorial) in the AWS CDK [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

### At a glance

Install or update the [AWS CDK CLI] from npm (requires [Node.js ≥ 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/)). We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)

```sh
npm i -g aws-cdk
```

(See [Manual Installation](./MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md) for installing the CDK from a signed .zip file).

Initialize a project:

```sh
mkdir hello-cdk
cd hello-cdk
cdk init sample-app --language=typescript
```

This creates a sample project looking like this:

```ts
export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, &#039;HelloCdkQueue&#039;, {
      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    });

    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, &#039;HelloCdkTopic&#039;);

    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));
  }
}
```

Deploy this to your account:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

Use the `cdk` command-line toolkit to interact with your project:

* `cdk deploy`: deploys your app into an AWS account
* `cdk synth`: synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template for your app

# Frigate - NVR With Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras

A complete and local NVR designed for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a [Google Coral Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/) is optional, but highly recommended. The Coral will outperform even the best CPUs and can process 100+ FPS with very little overhead.

- Tight integration with Home Assistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
- WebRTC &amp; MSE support for low-latency live view

- **Feature packed:** customizable collision detection algorithms, multiple activators, draggable overlay, drag handles, auto-scrolling, constraints, and so much more.
- **Built for React:** exposes hooks such as [`useDraggable`](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/draggable) and [`useDroppable`](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/droppable). and won&#039;t force you to re-architect your app or create additional wrapper DOM nodes.
- **Supports a wide range of use cases:** lists, grids, multiple containers, nested contexts, variable sized items, virtualized lists, 2D Games, and more.
- **Zero dependencies and modular:** the core of the library weighs around 10kb minified and has no external dependencies. It&#039;s built around built-in React state management and context, which keeps the library lean.
- **Built-in support for multiple input methods:** Pointer, mouse, touch and keyboard sensors.
- **Fully customizable &amp; extensible:** Customize every detail: animations, transitions, behaviours, styles. Build your own sensors, collision detection algorithms, customize key bindings and so much more.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard support, sensible default aria attributes, customizable screen reader instructions and live regions built-in.
- **Performance:** It was built with performance in mind in order to support silky smooth animations.
- **Presets:** Need to build a sortable interface? Check out `@dnd-kit/sortable`, which is a thin layer built on top of `@dnd-kit/core`. More presets coming in the future.

## Documentation

To learn how to get started with **dnd kit**, visit the official documentation website. You&#039;ll find in-depth API documentation, tips and guides to help you build drag and drop interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.dndkit.com&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Visit @dnd-kit documentation&quot; src=&quot;.github/assets/documentation.svg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Key concepts

The core library of **dnd kit** exposes two main concepts:

- [Draggable elements](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/draggable)
- [Droppable areas](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/droppable)

Augment your existing components using the `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` hooks, or combine both to create components that can both be dragged and dropped over.

Handle events and customize the behaviour of your draggable elements and droppable areas using the `&lt;DndContext&gt;` provider. Configure sensors to handle different input methods.

Use the `&lt;DragOverlay&gt;` component to render a draggable overlay that is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to the viewport.

Check out our [quick start guide](https://docs.dndkit.com/introduction/getting-started) to learn how get started.

### Extensibility

Extensibility is at the core of **dnd kit**. It is built to be lean and extensible. It ships with the features we believe most people will want most of the time, and provides extension points to build the rest on top of `@dnd-kit/core`.

A prime example of the level of extensibility of **dnd kit** is the [Sortable preset](https://docs.dndkit.com/presets/sortable), which is built using the extension points that are exposed by `@dnd-kit/core`.

The primary extension points of **dnd kit** are:

- Sensors
- Modifiers
- Constraints
- Custom collision detection algorithms

### Accessibility

Building accessible drag and drop interfaces is hard; **dnd kit** has a number of sensible defaults and starting points to help you make your drag and drop interface accessible:

- Customizable **screen reader instructions** for how to interact with draggable items
- Customizable **live region updates** to provide screen reader announcements in real-time of what is currently happening with draggable and droppable elements.
- Sensible defaults for **`aria` attributes** that should be passed to draggable items

Check out our [Accessibility guide](https://docs.dndkit.com/guides/accessibility) to learn more about how you can help provide a better experience for screen readers.

### Architecture

Unlike most drag and drop libraries, **dnd kit** intentionally is **not** built on top of the [HTML5 Drag and drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API). This was a deliberate architectural decision, that does come with tradeoffs that you should be aware of before deciding to use it, but for most applications, we believe the benefits outweigh the tradeoffs.

The HTML5 Drag and drop API has some severe **limitations**. It does not support touch devices or using the keyboard to drag items, which means that the libraries that are built on top of it need to expose an entirely different implementation to support those input methods. It also doesn&#039;t support common use-cases such as locking dragging to a specific axis or to the bounds of a container, custom collision detection strategies, or even customizing the preview of the dragged item.

While there are workarounds to some of these issues, those workarounds typically increase the complexity of the codebase and the overall bundle size of the library, and lead to inconsistencies between the mouse, touch and keyboard layers because they&#039;re powered by entirely different implementations.

The main **tradeoff** with not using the HTML5 Drag and drop API is that you won&#039;t be able to drag from the desktop or between windows. If the drag and drop use-case you have in mind involves this kind of functionality, you&#039;ll definitely want to use a library that&#039;s built on top of the HTML 5 Drag and drop API. We highly recommend you check out [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/) for a React library that&#039;s has a native HTML 5 Drag and drop backend.

### Performance

#### **Minimizing DOM mutations**

**dnd kit** lets you build drag and drop interfaces without having to mutate the DOM every time an item needs to shift position.

This is possible because **dnd kit** lazily calculates and stores the initial positions and layout of your droppable containers when a drag operation is initiated. These positions are passed down to your components that use `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` so that you can compute the new positions of your items while a drag operation is underway, and move them to their new positions using performant CSS properties that do not trigger a repaint such as `translate3d` and `scale`. For an example of how this can be achieved, check out the implementation of the sorting strategies that are exposed by the [`@dnd-kit/sortable`](packages/sortable/README.md) library.

This isn&#039;t to say that you can&#039;t shift the position of the items in the DOM while dragging, this is something that **is supported** and sometimes inevitable. In some cases, it won&#039;t be possible to know in advance what the new position and layout of the item until you move it in the DOM. Just know that these kind of mutations to the DOM while dragging are much more expensive and will cause a repaint, so if possible, prefer computing the new positions using `translate3d` and `scale`.

#### Synthetic events

**dnd kit** also uses [SyntheticEvent listeners](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) for the activator events of all sensors, which leads to improved performance over manually adding event listeners to each individual draggable node.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Playful illustration of draggable and droppable concepts. A robot picks up a draggable card and moves it over a droppable container.&quot; src=&quot;.github/assets/concepts-illustration.svg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Working in the `@dnd-kit` repository

### Packages contained within this repository

- `@dnd-kit/core`
- `@dnd-kit/accessibility`
- `@dnd-kit/sortable`
- `@dnd-kit/modifiers`
- `@dnd-kit/utilities`

### Installing dependencies

You&#039;ll need to install all the dependencies in the root directory. Since the `@dnd-kit` is a monorepo that uses Lerna and Yarn Workspaces, npm CLI is not supported (only yarn).

```sh
yarn install
```

This will install all dependencies in each project, build them, and symlink them via Lerna

### Development workflow

In one terminal, run `yarn start` in parallel:

```sh
yarn start
```

This builds each package to `&lt;packages&gt;/&lt;package&gt;/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `&lt;packages&gt;/&lt;package&gt;/src` cause a rebuild to `&lt;packages&gt;/&lt;package&gt;/dist`. The results will stream to to the terminal.

### Running storybook

```sh
yarn start:storybook
```

Runs the storybook
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

![Screenshot of Storybook running locally](.github/assets/storybook-screenshot.png)

### Working with the playground

You can play with local packages in the Parcel-powered playground.

```sh
yarn start:playground
```

This will start the playground on `localhost:1234`. If you have lerna running watch in parallel mode in one terminal, and then you run parcel, your playground will hot reload when you make changes to any imported module whose source is inside of `packages/*/src/*`. Note that to accomplish this, each package&#039;s `start` command passes TDSX the `--noClean` flag. This prevents Parcel from exploding between rebuilds because of File Not Found errors.

Important Safety Tip: When adding/altering packages in the playground, use `alias` object in package.json. This will tell Parcel to resolve them to the filesystem instead of trying to install the package from NPM. It also fixes duplicate React errors you may run into.

### Running Cypress

(In a third terminal) you can run Cypress and it will run the integration tests against storybook.

# Getting Started
`@diffusionstudio/core` is a 2D motion graphics and video rendering engine powered by WebCodecs. Developers commonly use it for video editing automations and to build editing [playgrounds/web apps](https://playground.diffusion.studio).

## Documentation
Explore the full documentation at [docs.diffusion.studio](https://docs.diffusion.studio/docs).

## Credits
This project owes much to [@Vanilagy&#039;s](https://github.com/Vanilagy) exceptional muxer implementations.

## Why Use Diffusion Studio
💻 100% **client-side**&lt;br/&gt;
🪽 **Small bundle size** – Only 75 KB with a single dependency&lt;br/&gt;
🩸 Blazingly **fast** WebCodecs renderer&lt;br/&gt;
🦾 **AI-first** architecture&lt;br/&gt;

## Getting Started
```sh
npm install @diffusionstudio/core
```

## Benchmarks
![Benchmarks](./assets/benchmarks.png)

## Basic Usage
Here’s an example of how to use the library:

```javascript
import * as core from &#039;@diffusionstudio/core&#039;;

const url = &#039;https://diffusion-studio-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/videos/big_buck_bunny_1080p_30fps.mp4&#039;;

// create a video clip and trim it
const video = new core.VideoClip(url).subclip(0, &#039;10s&#039;);

// create a text clip and add styles
const text = new core.TextClip({ 
  text: &#039;Bunny - Our Brave Hero&#039;, 
  position: &#039;center&#039;, 
  duration: &#039;5s&#039;, 
  stroke: { color: &#039;#000000&#039; } 
});

const composition = new core.Composition(); // 1920x1080

// this is how to compose your clips
await composition.add(video);  // convenience function for 
await composition.add(text);   // clip -&gt; layer -&gt; composition

await new core.Encoder(composition).render(&#039;hello_world.mp4&#039;);
```

The API models the structure of conventional video editing applications like Adobe Premiere or CapCut, using a layer-based system. Each layer contains zero or more clips of a single type, arranged in ascending chronological order.

Layers are created implicitly with `composition.add(clip)`, but you can also create them manually:

```typescript
const layer = composition.createLayer();
await layer.add(text0);
await layer.add(text1);
await layer.add(text2);
...
```

## How Does Diffusion Studio Compare?

### Remotion
A React-based video creation tool that converts the DOM into videos. It’s beginner-friendly, allowing web developers to leverage their existing skills.

### Motion Canvas 
A standalone editor designed for high-quality animations. It features an imperative API, adding elements procedurally rather than relying on keyframes, making it ideal for detailed animations.

### Diffusion Studio
A video editing **library** rather than a framework with a visual interface. It’s lightweight, operates entirely on the **client-side**, and supports WebCodecs without relying on WebAssembly/ffmpeg. Ideal for integration into existing projects.

## Contributing

* **Realtime playback**
* **Hardware accelerated** encoding via WebCodecs
* **Dynamic render resolution and framerate**

## Background

This project was initiated in March 2023 with the mission of creating a “video processing toolkit for the era of AI.” As someone passionate about video editing for over a decade, the release of WebCodecs and WebGPU without feature flags in Chrome presented the perfect opportunity to build something new.

Traditional browser-based video editors rely on server-side rendering, requiring time-consuming uploads and downloads of large files. With WebCodecs, video processing can now be done directly in the browser, making it significantly faster and more efficient.

I’m excited to contribute to the next generation of video editing technology.

## Installation

Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.

### Using init command

The easiest way to get started with Playwright Test is to run the init command.

```Shell
# Run from your project&#039;s root directory
npm init playwright@latest
# Or create a new project
npm init playwright@latest new-project
```

This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts. You can now jump directly to writing assertions section.

### Manually

Add dependency and install browsers.

```Shell
npm i -D @playwright/test
# install supported browsers
npx playwright install
```

You can optionally install only selected browsers, see [install browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#install-browsers) for more details. Or you can install no browsers at all and use existing [browser channels](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).

## Capabilities

### Resilient • No flaky tests

**Auto-wait**. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - a primary cause of flaky tests.

**Web-first assertions**. Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.

**Tracing**. Configure test retry strategy, capture execution trace, videos and screenshots to eliminate flakes.

### No trade-offs • No limits

Browsers run web content belonging to different origins in different processes. Playwright is aligned with the architecture of the modern browsers and runs tests out-of-process. This makes Playwright free of the typical in-process test runner limitations.

**Multiple everything**. Test scenarios that span multiple tabs, multiple origins and multiple users. Create scenarios with different contexts for different users and run them against your server, all in one test.

**Trusted events**. Hover elements, interact with dynamic controls and produce trusted events. Playwright uses real browser input pipeline indistinguishable from the real user.

Test frames, pierce Shadow DOM. Playwright selectors pierce shadow DOM and allow entering frames seamlessly.

### Full isolation • Fast execution

**Browser contexts**. Playwright creates a browser context for each test. Browser context is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context only takes a handful of milliseconds.

**Log in once**. Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests.

### Powerful Tooling

**[Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen)**. Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language.

**[Playwright inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector)**. Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points and explore execution logs.

**[Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer)**. Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source and many more.

```TypeScript
import { test } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test(&#039;Page Screenshot&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  await page.goto(&#039;https://playwright.dev/&#039;);
  await page.screenshot({ path: `example.png` });
});
```

#### Mobile and geolocation

This snippet emulates Mobile Safari on a device at given geolocation, navigates to maps.google.com, performs the action and takes a screenshot.

```TypeScript
import { test, devices } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test.use({
  ...devices[&#039;iPhone 13 Pro&#039;],
  locale: &#039;en-US&#039;,

  permissions: [&#039;geolocation&#039;],
})

test(&#039;Mobile and geolocation&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  await page.goto(&#039;https://maps.google.com&#039;);
  await page.getByText(&#039;Your location&#039;).click();
  await page.waitForRequest(/.*preview\/pwa/);
  await page.screenshot({ path: &#039;colosseum-iphone.png&#039; });
});
```

#### Evaluate in browser context

This code snippet navigates to example.com, and executes a script in the page context.

```TypeScript
import { test } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test(&#039;Evaluate in browser context&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  await page.goto(&#039;https://www.example.com/&#039;);
  const dimensions = await page.evaluate(() =&gt; {
    return {
      width: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
      height: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
      deviceScaleFactor: window.devicePixelRatio
    }
  });
  console.log(dimensions);
});
```

#### Intercept network requests

This code snippet sets up request routing for a page to log all network requests.

```TypeScript
import { test } from &#039;@playwright/test&#039;;

test(&#039;Intercept network requests&#039;, async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  // Log and continue all network requests
  await page.route(&#039;**&#039;, route =&gt; {
    console.log(route.request().url());
    route.continue();
  });
  await page.goto(&#039;http://todomvc.com&#039;);
});
```

## Intro

&lt;p align=&#039;center&#039;&gt;
  &lt;del&gt;&lt;em&gt;by the power of TypeScript&#039;s well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833&quot;&gt;Turing Completed&lt;/a&gt; type system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

High-quality types can help improve projects&#039; maintainability while avoiding potential bugs.

This project is aimed at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges. We are also trying to form a community where you can ask questions and get answers you have faced in the real world - they may become part of the challenges!

You can also use some existing type utility libraries such as [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest). There are also some stale packages (not actively maintained) that you could reference, like  [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types), [ts-toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt), [SimplyTyped](https://github.com/andnp/SimplyTyped).

To continue improving your experience, we have to eventually deprecate or remove certain addons in favor of new and better tools.

If you&#039;re using info/notes, we highly recommend you migrate to [docs](code/addons/docs/) instead, and [here is a guide](code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#migrating-from-notesinfo-addons) to help you.

If you&#039;re using contexts, we highly recommend you migrate to [toolbars](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/toolbars) and [here is a guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#deprecated-addon-contexts) to help you.

If you&#039;re using addon-storyshots, we highly recommend you migrate to the Storybook [test-runner](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner) and [here is a guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/storyshots-migration-guide) to help you.

### Development scripts

Storybook is organized as a monorepo. Useful scripts include:

#### `yarn start`

&gt; Runs a sandbox template storybook with test stories

#### `yarn task`

&gt; As above, but gives you options to customize the sandbox (e.g. selecting other frameworks)

#### `yarn lint`

&gt; boolean check if code conforms to linting rules - uses remark &amp; eslint

- `yarn lint:js` - will check js
- `yarn lint:md` - will check markdown + code samples
- `yarn lint:js --fix` - will automatically fix js

#### `yarn test`

&gt; boolean check if unit tests all pass - uses jest

- `yarn run test --core --watch` - will run core tests in watch-mode

## 🤸 Usage

### 🚥 Limit releases to pushes to tags

Typically usage of this action involves adding a step to a build that
is gated pushes to git tags. You may find `step.if` field helpful in accomplishing this
as it maximizes the reuse value of your workflow for non-tag pushes.

Below is a simple example of `step.if` tag gating

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        if: github.ref_type == &#039;tag&#039;
```

You can also use push config tag filter

```yaml
name: Main

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - &quot;v*.*.*&quot;

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
```

### ⬆️ Uploading release assets

You can configure a number of options for your
GitHub release and all are optional.

A common case for GitHub releases is to upload your binary after its been validated and packaged.
Use the `with.files` input to declare a newline-delimited list of glob expressions matching the files
you wish to upload to GitHub releases. If you&#039;d like you can just list the files by name directly.
If a tag already has a GitHub release, the existing release will be updated with the release assets.

Below is an example of uploading a single asset named `Release.txt`

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build
        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} &gt; Release.txt
      - name: Test
        run: cat Release.txt
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        if: github.ref_type == &#039;tag&#039;
        with:
          files: Release.txt
```

Below is an example of uploading more than one asset with a GitHub release

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build
        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} &gt; Release.txt
      - name: Test
        run: cat Release.txt
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        if: github.ref_type == &#039;tag&#039;
        with:
          files: |
            Release.txt
            LICENSE
```

&gt; **⚠️ Note:** Notice the `|` in the yaml syntax above ☝️. That lets you effectively declare a multi-line yaml string. You can learn more about multi-line yaml syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info)

&gt; **⚠️ Note for Windows:** Paths must use `/` as a separator, not `\`, as `\` is used to escape characters with special meaning in the pattern; for example, instead of specifying `D:\Foo.txt`, you must specify `D:/Foo.txt`. If you&#039;re using PowerShell, you can do this with `$Path = $Path -replace &#039;\\&#039;,&#039;/&#039;`

### 📝 External release notes

Many systems exist that can help generate release notes for you. This action supports
loading release notes from a path in your repository&#039;s build to allow for the flexibility
of using any changelog generator for your releases, including a human 👩‍💻

```yaml
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Changelog
        run: echo &quot;# Good things have arrived&quot; &gt; ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        if: github.ref_type == &#039;tag&#039;
        with:
          body_path: ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt
          repository: my_gh_org/my_gh_repo
          # note you&#039;ll typically need to create a personal access token
          # with permissions to create releases in the other repo
          token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### 💅 Customizing

| `discussion_category_name` | String  | If specified, a discussion of the specified category is created and linked to the release. The value must be a category that already exists in the repository. For more information, see [&quot;Managing categories for discussions in your repository.&quot;](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)                                                     |

| `make_latest`              | String  | Specifies whether this release should be set as the latest release for the repository. Drafts and prereleases cannot be set as latest. Can be `true`, `false`, or `legacy`. Uses GitHub api defaults if not provided                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

💡 When providing a `body` and `body_path` at the same time, `body_path` will be
attempted first, then falling back on `body` if the path can not be read from.

💡 When the release info keys (such as `name`, `body`, `draft`, `prerelease`, etc.)
are not explicitly set and there is already an existing release for the tag, the
release will retain its original info.

#### outputs

The following outputs can be accessed via `${{ steps.&lt;step-id&gt;.outputs }}` from this action

| Name         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`        | String | Github.com URL for the release                                                                                                                                                            |

| `upload_url` | String | URL for uploading assets to the release                                                                                                                                                   |
| `assets`     | String | JSON array containing information about each uploaded asset, in the format given [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets#get-a-release-asset) (minus the `uploader` field) |

As an example, you can use `${{ fromJSON(steps.&lt;step-id&gt;.outputs.assets)[0].browser_download_url }}` to get the download URL of the first asset.

#### environment variables

The following `step.env` keys are allowed as a fallback but deprecated in favor of using inputs.

| Name                | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`      | GITHUB_TOKEN as provided by `secrets`                                                      |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Name of a target repository in `&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;` format. defaults to the current repository |

&gt; **⚠️ Note:** This action was previously implemented as a Docker container, limiting its use to GitHub Actions Linux virtual environments only. With recent releases, we now support cross platform usage. You&#039;ll need to remove the `docker://` prefix in these versions

### Permissions

This Action requires the following permissions on the GitHub integration token:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

When used with `discussion_category_name`, additional permission is needed:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  discussions: write
```

[GitHub token permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) can be set for an individual job, workflow, or for Actions as a whole.

Note that if you intend to run workflows on the release event (`on: { release: { types: [published] } }`), you need to use
a personal access token for this action, as the [default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger another workflow](https://github.com/actions/create-release/issues/71).
