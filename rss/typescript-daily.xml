### Onlook for Desktop (aka Onlook Alpha)

We&#039;re in early preview for Onlook Web. If you&#039;re looking for the downloadable desktop electron app, it&#039;s moved to [Onlook Desktop](https://github.com/onlook-dev/desktop).

Why are we moving to the web? Read about our decision: 
[Migrating from Electron to Web](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/electron-to-web-migration)

## Getting Started

Available soon with a [hosted app](https://onlook.com) or
[run locally](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/running-locally).

### Usage

Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project
through into Onlook or start from scratch within the editor.

Use the AI chat to create or edit a project you&#039;re working on. At any time, you can
always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element in
code.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad9f411-b172-4430-81ef-650f4f314666&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Draw-in new divs and re-arrange them within their parent containers by dragging-and-dropping.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/insert-div.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Preview the code side-by-side with your site design.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/code-connect.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Use Onlook&#039;s editor toolbar to adjust Tailwind styles, directly manipulate objects, and experiment with layouts.

To see how to Contribute, visit
[Contributing to Onlook](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/contributing) in our docs.

## How it works

&lt;img width=&quot;676&quot; alt=&quot;architecture&quot; src=&quot;assets/architecture.png&quot;&gt;

1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container
2. The container runs and serves the code
3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame
4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container
5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code
6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code
7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code

This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that
displays DOM elements declaratively (e.g. jsx/tsx/html). We are focused on making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS for now.

For a full walkthrough, check out our
[Architecture Docs](https://docs.onlook.com/docs/developer/architecture).

&lt;/div&gt;

[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/) is a suite of advanced React UI components for a wide range of complex use cases.
Each component provides best-in-class UX and DX, with sophisticated UX workflows for data-rich applications.
Components include the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree View.

MUI X extends the core functionality of [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/), but the advanced components also stand on their own and can be fully customized to meet the needs of any design system.

MUI X is **open-core**: [Community](#community-plan) components are MIT-licensed and free forever, while more advanced features and components require a [Pro](#pro-plan) or [Premium](#premium-plan) commercial license.
See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.

## Documentation

## Licensing

The MUI X team has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, starting with Material UI, and we&#039;re committed to the continued advancement of our open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
Learn more about [our stewardship ethos](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced components and features that can&#039;t reasonably be maintained by the open-source community alone.
These licenses make it possible for us to support a full-time staff of engineers.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it&#039;s only because we believe you won&#039;t find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

### Plans

#### Community plan

The free Community version of MUI X contains components and features that we believe are maintainable by contributions from the open-source community.
It&#039;s published under an [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and it&#039;s [free forever](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd#20f609acab4441cf9346614119fbbac1).

- [`@mui/x-charts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-charts)
- [`@mui/x-tree-view`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-tree-view)

#### Pro plan

MUI X Pro expands on the Community version with more advanced features and functionality.
The Data Grid Pro comes with multi-filtering, multi-sorting, column resizing, and column pinning; you also gain access to the Date and Time Range Picker components, advanced Charts, and drag-and-drop reordering for the Tree View.

The Pro version is available under a commercial license—visit the [Pricing page](https://mui.com/pricing/) for details.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Install and initialize project
npx promptfoo@latest init

# Run your first evaluation
npx promptfoo eval
```

See [Getting Started](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/getting-started/) (evals) or [Red Teaming](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/) (vulnerability scanning) for more.

## What can you do with Promptfoo?

- **Test your prompts and models** with [automated evaluations](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- **Secure your LLM apps** with [red teaming](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/) and vulnerability scanning
- **Compare models** side-by-side (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, Ollama, and [more](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/providers/))
- **Automate checks** in [CI/CD](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/integrations/ci-cd/)
- **Share results** with your team

Here&#039;s what it looks like in action:

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Templates for Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers let you deploy serverless code instantly across the globe for exceptional performance, reliability, and scale. This repository contains a collection of starter templates for building full-stack applications on Workers. **You are encouraged to use, modify, and extend this code!**

## Getting Started

There are two ways to start building with a template in this repository: the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI).

### Starting from the Dashboard

After logging in or signing up through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), open the [Workers templates page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/templates) and select a template to get started with. From here, you can create a repository and deploy your first Worker without needing a local development environment.

### Starting via CLI

To get started locally, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest
# or
pnpm create cloudflare@latest
# or
yarn create cloudflare@latest
```

For more information on getting started with our CLI, check out the [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).

### Additional Resources

Questions about Workers? Join the [official Cloudflare Discord](https://workers.community/) or check out the [Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)!

## Contributing

We welcome template contributions! If there&#039;s a Workers template you think would be valuable, please read our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and open an issue or pull request.

## About the Project

Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code in short amount of time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

### Why Better Auth

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem is a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often requires a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.

## Contribution

Better Auth is free and open source project licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md). You are free to do whatever you want with it.

You could help continuing its development by:

- [Contribute to the source code](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Suggest new features and report issues](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues)

## Security
If you discover a security vulnerability within Better Auth, please send an e-mail to security@better-auth.com.

All reports will be promptly addressed, and you&#039;ll be credited accordingly.

### Local development

#### Run via Docker

The application can be run using Docker in two ways:

##### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with your API keys
3. Run the following command in the project root:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

##### Using Docker Directly

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with your API keys
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t scira.app .
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 scira.app
   ```

The application uses a multi-stage build process to minimize the final image size and implements security best practices. The production image runs on Node.js LTS with Alpine Linux for a minimal footprint.

#### Run with Node.js

To run the application locally without Docker:

1. Sign up for accounts with the required AI providers:
   - OpenAI (required)
   - Anthropic (required)
   - Tavily (required for web search feature)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

# Zero

An Open-Source Gmail Alternative for the Future of Email

## What is Zero?

Zero is an open-source AI email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to modernize and improve emails through AI agents to truly modernize emails.

## Why Zero?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**.
0.email is different:

- ✅ **Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, fully transparent.
- 🦾 **AI Driven** - Enhance your emails with Agents &amp; LLMs.
- 🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your emails, your data. Zero does not track, collect, or sell your data in any way. Please note: while we integrate with external services, the data passed through them is not under our control and falls under their respective privacy policies and terms of service.
- ⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own email app with ease.
- 📬 **Unified Inbox** – Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.
- 🎨 **Customizable UI &amp; Features** – Tailor your email experience the way you want it.
- 🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Tech Stack

Zero is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth
&lt;!-- - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library --&gt;

     ```env
     BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
     ```

2. **Google OAuth Setup** (Required for Gmail integration)

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Add the following APIs in your Google Cloud Project: [People API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com), [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
     - Use the links above and click &#039;Enable&#039; or

   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - Development:
       - `http://localhost:8787/api/auth/callback/google`
     - Production:
       - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Add to `.env`:

     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     ```

### Environment Variables

Run `pnpm nizzy env` to setup your environment variables. It will copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the variables for you.
For local development a connection string example is provided in the `.env.example` file located in the same folder as the database.

### Database Setup

Zero uses PostgreSQL for storing data. Here&#039;s how to set it up:

1. **Start the Database**

   Run this command to start a local PostgreSQL instance:

   ```bash
   pnpm docker:db:up
   ```

   This creates a database with:

   - Name: `zerodotemail`
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `postgres`
   - Port: `5432`

2. **Set Up Database Connection**

   Make sure your database connection string is in `.env` file. And you have ran `pnpm nizzy sync` to sync the latest env.

   For local development use:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&quot;postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/zerodotemail&quot;
   ```

3. **Database Commands**

   - **Set up database tables**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:push
     ```

   - **Create migration files** (after schema changes):

     ```bash
     pnpm db:generate
     ```

   - **Apply migrations**:

     ```bash
     pnpm db:migrate
     ```

   - **View database content**:
     ```bash
     pnpm db:studio
     ```
     &gt; If you run `pnpm dev` in your terminal, the studio command should be automatically running with the app.
