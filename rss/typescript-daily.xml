**POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language)** is a novel markup language designed to bring structure, maintainability, and versatility to advanced prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses common challenges in prompt development, such as lack of structure, complex data integration, format sensitivity, and inadequate tooling. POML provides a systematic way to organize prompt components, integrate diverse data types seamlessly, and manage presentation variations, empowering developers to create more sophisticated and reliable LLM applications.

## Demo Video

[![The 5-minute guide to POML](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/b9WDcFsKixo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/b9WDcFsKixo)

## Key Features

* **Structured Prompting Markup**: Employs an HTML-like syntax with semantic components such as `&lt;role&gt;`, `&lt;task&gt;`, and `&lt;example&gt;` to encourage modular design, enhancing prompt readability, reusability, and maintainability.
* **Comprehensive Data Handling**: Incorporates specialized data components (e.g., `&lt;document&gt;`, `&lt;table&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;`) that seamlessly embed or reference external data sources like text files, spreadsheets, and images, with customizable formatting options.
* **Decoupled Presentation Styling**: Features a CSS-like styling system that separates content from presentation. This allows developers to modify styling (e.g., verbosity, syntax format) via `&lt;stylesheet&gt;` definitions or inline attributes without altering core prompt logic, mitigating LLM format sensitivity.
* **Integrated Templating Engine**: Includes a built-in templating engine with support for variables (`{{ }}`), loops (`for`), conditionals (`if`), and variable definitions (`&lt;let&gt;`) for dynamically generating complex, data-driven prompts.
* **Rich Development Toolkit**:
    * **IDE Extension (Visual Studio Code)**: Provides essential development aids like syntax highlighting, context-aware auto-completion, hover documentation, real-time previews, inline diagnostics for error checking, and integrated interactive testing.
    * **Software Development Kits (SDKs)**: Offers SDKs for Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) and Python for seamless integration into various application workflows and popular LLM frameworks.

## Quick Start

Here&#039;s a very simple POML example. Please put it in a file named `example.poml`. Make sure it resides in the same directory as the `photosynthesis_diagram.png` image file.

```xml
&lt;poml&gt;
  &lt;role&gt;You are a patient teacher explaining concepts to a 10-year-old.&lt;/role&gt;
  &lt;task&gt;Explain the concept of photosynthesis using the provided image as a reference.&lt;/task&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;photosynthesis_diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of photosynthesis&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;output-format&gt;
    Keep the explanation simple, engaging, and under 100 words.
    Start with &quot;Hey there, future scientist!&quot;.
  &lt;/output-format&gt;
&lt;/poml&gt;
```

This example defines a role and task for the LLM, includes an image for context, and specifies the desired output format. With the POML toolkit, the prompt can be easily rendered with a flexible format, and tested with a vision LLM.

## Installation

### Visual Studio Code Extension

Install from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=poml-team.poml).

You can also install the extension manually by downloading the `.vsix` file from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/poml/releases) and installing it in VS Code via the Extensions view.

Before testing prompts with the POML toolkit, make sure you have configured your preferred LLM model, API key, and endpoint. If these are not set, prompt testing will not work.

**To configure in Visual Studio Code:**
- Open the extension settings (open &quot;Settings&quot; and search for &quot;POML&quot;).
- Set your model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Google), API key, and endpoint URL in the POML section.
- Alternatively, you can add these settings directly to your `settings.json` file.

### Node.js (via npm)

```bash
npm install pomljs
```

### Python (via pip)

```bash
pip install poml
```

For development or local installation, you might use `pip install -e .` from a cloned repository.

**Refer to the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/poml) for more details on installing the nightly build.**

OpenReplay is an open-source session replay suite you can host yourself, that lets you see what users do on your web app, helping you troubleshoot issues faster.

- **Session replay.** OpenReplay replays what users do, but not only. It also shows you what went under the hood, how your website or app behaves by capturing network activity, console logs, JS errors, store actions/state, page speed metrics, cpu/memory usage and much more.
- **Low footprint**. With a ~26KB (.br) tracker that asynchronously sends minimal data for a very limited impact on performance.
- **Self-hosted**. No more security compliance checks, 3rd-parties processing user data. Everything OpenReplay captures stays in your cloud for a complete control over your data.
- **Privacy controls**. Fine-grained security features for sanitizing user data.
- **Easy deploy**. With support of major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean).

## Features

- **Session replay:** Lets you relive your users&#039; experience, see where they struggle and how it affects their behavior. Each session replay is automatically analyzed based on heuristics, for easy triage.
- **Spot:** A Chrome extension that lets record bugs directly from your browser — each recording includes all the technical details developers need to fix them.
- **DevTools:** It&#039;s like debugging in your own browser. OpenReplay provides you with the full context (network activity, JS errors, store actions/state and 40+ metrics) so you can instantly reproduce bugs and understand performance issues.
- **Assist:** Helps you support your users by seeing their live screen and instantly hopping on call (WebRTC) with them without requiring any 3rd-party screen sharing software.
- **Omni-search:** Search and filter by almost any user action/criteria, session attribute or technical event, so you can answer any question. No instrumentation required.
- **Analytics:** For surfacing the most impactful issues causing conversion and revenue loss.
- **Fine-grained privacy controls:** Choose what to capture, what to obscure or what to ignore so user data doesn&#039;t even reach your servers.
- **Plugins oriented:** Get to the root cause even faster by tracking application state (Redux, VueX, MobX, NgRx, Pinia and Zustand) and logging GraphQL queries (Apollo, Relay) and Fetch/Axios requests.
- **Integrations:** Sync your backend logs with your session replays and see what happened front-to-back. OpenReplay supports Sentry, Datadog, CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Elastic and more.

## What is Epicenter?

Epicenter is an ecosystem of open-source, local-first apps. Our eventual goal is to store all of your data—notes, transcripts, chat histories—in a single folder of plain text and SQLite. Every tool we build shares this memory. It&#039;s open, tweakable, and yours. Grep it, open it in Obsidian, host it wherever you like. The choice is yours.



## Current Tools

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;🎙️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/whispering&quot;&gt;Whispering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Press shortcut → speak → get text. Desktop transcription that cuts out the middleman. Bring your own API key.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/whispering&quot;&gt;Explore Whispering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;🤖 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/sh&quot;&gt;epicenter.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A local-first assistant you can chat with. It lives in your folder, becoming the access point to everything you&#039;ve ever written, thought, or built.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;→ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/sh&quot;&gt;Explore epicenter.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## Where We&#039;re Headed

Our vision is to build a personal workspace where you own your data, choose your models, and replace siloed apps with open, interoperable alternatives. All while preserving authenticity and being free and open source.

BISHENG is an open LLM application devops platform, focusing on enterprise scenarios. It has been used by a large number of industry leading organizations and Fortune 500 companies.

&quot;Bi Sheng&quot; was the inventor of movable type printing, which played a vital role in promoting the transmission of human knowledge. We hope that BISHENG can also provide strong support for the widespread implementation of intelligent applications. Everyone is welcome to participate.


## Features 
1. Unique [BISHENG Workflow](https://dataelem.feishu.cn/wiki/R7HZwH5ZGiJUDrkHZXicA9pInif)
   - 🧩 **Independent and comprehensive application orchestration framework**: Enables the execution of various tasks within a single framework (while similar products rely on bot invocation or separate chatflow and workflow modules for different tasks).
   - 🔄 **Human in the loop**: Allows users to intervene and provide feedback during the execution of workflows (including multi-turn conversations), whereas similar products can only execute workflows from start to finish without intervention.
   - 💥 **Powerful**: Supports loops, parallelism, batch processing, conditional logic, and free combination of all logic components. It also handles complex scenarios such as multi-type input/output, report generation, content review, and more.
   - 🖐️ **User-friendly and intuitive**: Operations like loops, parallelism, and batch processing, which require specialized components in similar products, can be easily visualized in BISHENG as a &quot;flowchart&quot; (drawing a loop forms a loop, aligning elements creates parallelism, and selecting multiple items enables batch processing).
   &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dataelem.com/bs/bisheng_workflow.png&quot; alt=&quot;sence0&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

2. &lt;b&gt;Designed for Enterprise Applications&lt;/b&gt;: Document review, fixed-layout report generation, multi-agent collaboration, policy update comparison, support ticket assistance, customer service assistance, meeting minutes generation, resume screening, call record analysis, unstructured data governance, knowledge mining, data analysis, and more. 

​	The platform supports the construction of &lt;b&gt;highly complex enterprise application scenarios&lt;/b&gt; and offers &lt;b&gt;deep optimization&lt;/b&gt; 	with hundreds of components and thousands of parameters.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dataelem.com/bs/chat.png&quot; alt=&quot;sence1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

3. &lt;b&gt;Enterprise-grade&lt;/b&gt; features are the fundamental guarantee for application implementation: security review, RBAC, user group management, traffic control by group, SSO/LDAP, vulnerability scanning and patching, high availability deployment solutions, monitoring, statistics, and more.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dataelem.com/bs/pro.png&quot; alt=&quot;sence2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

4. &lt;b&gt;High-Precision Document Parsing&lt;/b&gt;: Our high-precision document parsing model is trained on a vast amount of high-quality data accumulated over past 5 years. It includes high-precision printed text, handwritten text, and rare character recognition models, table recognition models, layout analysis models, and seal models., table recognition models, layout analysis models, and seal models. You can deploy it privately for free.

# 🏢 Enterprise Edition

Building on the Community Edition, we are proud to introduce **Cherry Studio Enterprise Edition**—a privately-deployable AI productivity and management platform designed for modern teams and enterprises.

The Enterprise Edition addresses core challenges in team collaboration by centralizing the management of AI resources, knowledge, and data. It empowers organizations to enhance efficiency, foster innovation, and ensure compliance, all while maintaining 100% control over their data in a secure environment.

## Core Advantages

- **Unified Model Management**: Centrally integrate and manage various cloud-based LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and locally deployed private models. Employees can use them out-of-the-box without individual configuration.
- **Enterprise-Grade Knowledge Base**: Build, manage, and share team-wide knowledge bases. Ensures knowledge retention and consistency, enabling team members to interact with AI based on unified and accurate information.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Easily manage employee accounts and assign role-based permissions for different models, knowledge bases, and features through a unified admin backend.
- **Fully Private Deployment**: Deploy the entire backend service on your on-premises servers or private cloud, ensuring your data remains 100% private and under your control to meet the strictest security and compliance standards.
- **Reliable Backend Services**: Provides stable API services and enterprise-grade data backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity.

## ✨ Online Demo

&gt; 🚧 **Public Beta Notice**
&gt;
&gt; The Enterprise Edition is currently in its early public beta stage, and we are actively iterating and optimizing its features. We are aware that it may not be perfectly stable yet. If you encounter any issues or have valuable suggestions during your trial, we would be very grateful if you could contact us via email to provide feedback.

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React is an excellent tool for building front-end applications. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture that developers can follow, it often leads to a messy, inconsistent, and over-complicated codebase.

This repo attempts to present a way of creating React applications using some of the best tools in the ecosystem with a good project structure that scales very well. Based on my experience working with a lot of different codebases, this architecture turns out to be the most effective.

The goal here is to serve as a collection of resources and best practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and help developers write better applications.

Feel free to explore the sample app codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

## What makes a React application &quot;bulletproof&quot;?

This repo doesn&#039;t aim to be a silver bullet for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.

To get most out of it, do not get limited by the technologies used in this sample app, but rather focus on the principles and the concepts that are being presented here. The tools and libraries used here are just a suggestion, you can always replace them with something that fits your needs better. Sometimes, your project might require a slightly different approach, and that&#039;s totally fine.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

![Onlook-GitHub-Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642de37a-72cc-4056-8eb7-8eb42714cdc4)

## Getting Started

Available soon with a [hosted app](https://onlook.com) or
[run locally](https://docs.onlook.com/developers/running-locally).

### Usage

Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project into
Onlook or start from scratch within the editor.

Use the AI chat to create or edit a project you&#039;re working on. At any time, you
can always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element
in code.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad9f411-b172-4430-81ef-650f4f314666&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Draw-in new divs and re-arrange them within their parent containers by
dragging-and-dropping.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/insert-div.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Preview the code side-by-side with your site design.

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/code-connect.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Use Onlook&#039;s editor toolbar to adjust Tailwind styles, directly manipulate
objects, and experiment with layouts.

## How it works

&lt;img width=&quot;676&quot; alt=&quot;architecture&quot; src=&quot;assets/architecture.png&quot;&gt;

1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container
2. The container runs and serves the code
3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame
4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container
5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code
6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code
7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code

This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that
displays DOM elements declaratively (e.g. jsx/tsx/html). We are focused on
making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS for now.

For a full walkthrough, check out our
[Architecture Docs](https://docs.onlook.com/developers/architecture).

## About the team
The Angular Components team is part of the Angular team at Google. The team includes both Google
employees and community contributors from around the globe.

Our team has two primary goals:
* Build high-quality UI components that developers can drop into existing applications
* Provide tools that help developers build their own custom components with common interaction
patterns


What do we mean by &quot;high-quality&quot; components?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don&#039;t confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular developers.

## Browser and screen reader support
The Angular Components team supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and  Edge.

We aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:
* **Windows**: NVDA and JAWS with FF / Chrome.
* **macOS**: VoiceOver with Safari / Chrome.
* **iOS**: VoiceOver with Safari
* **Android**: Android Accessibility Suite (formerly TalkBack) with Chrome.
* **Chrome OS**: ChromeVox with Chrome.

# 🔥 Firecrawl

Empower your AI apps with clean data from any website. Featuring advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities.

_This repository is in development, and we’re still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It&#039;s not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

- **Customizability**: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc...
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
- **Batching (New)**: scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint.

You can find all of Firecrawl&#039;s capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev)

### Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;limit&quot;: 10,
      &quot;scrapeOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
      }
    }&#039;
```

Returns a crawl job id and the url to check the status of the crawl.

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;123-456-789&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789&quot;
}
```

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789 \
  -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
  -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039;

      &quot;statusCode&quot;: 200
    }
  }
}
```

### Map

Used to map a URL and get urls of the website. This returns most links present on the website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;
    }&#039;
```

Response:

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/playground&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/smart-crawl&quot;,
  ]
}
```

#### Map with search

Map with `search` param allows you to search for specific urls inside a website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;search&quot;: &quot;docs&quot;
    }&#039;
```

Response will be an ordered list from the most relevant to the least relevant.

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python&quot;,
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3&quot;,
  ]
}
```

### Search

Search the web and get full content from results

Firecrawl’s search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation.

- Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
- Search the web with customizable parameters (language, country, etc.)
- Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats
- Control the number of results and set timeouts

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;what is firecrawl?&quot;,
    &quot;limit&quot;: 5
  }&#039;
```

#### Response

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl | Home Page&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Turn websites into LLM-ready data with Firecrawl&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Documentation | Firecrawl&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Learn how to use Firecrawl in your own applications&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

#### With content scraping

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search \
  -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot; \
  -d &#039;{
    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;what is firecrawl?&quot;,
    &quot;limit&quot;: 5,
    &quot;scrapeOptions&quot;: {
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;links&quot;]
    }
  }&#039;
```

### Extract (Beta)

Get structured data from entire websites with a prompt and/or a schema.

You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards:

Single Page:
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/some-page

Multiple Pages / Full Domain
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/*

When you use /*, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/extract \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [
        &quot;https://firecrawl.dev/*&quot;, 
        &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;, 
        &quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/companies&quot;
      ],
      &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission, whether it is open source, and whether it is in Y Combinator from the page.&quot;,
      &quot;schema&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
        &quot;properties&quot;: {
          &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          }
        },
        &quot;required&quot;: [
          &quot;company_mission&quot;,
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
        ]
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;44aa536d-f1cb-4706-ab87-ed0386685740&quot;,
  &quot;urlTrace&quot;: []
}
```

If you are using the sdks, it will auto pull the response for you:

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl is the easiest way to extract data from the web. Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.&quot;,
    &quot;supports_sso&quot;: false,
    &quot;is_open_source&quot;: true,
    &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
  }
}
```

### LLM Extraction (Beta)

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.mendable.ai/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;json&quot;],
      &quot;jsonOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;schema&quot;: {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
          &quot;properties&quot;: {
            &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
            },
            &quot;supports_sso&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            },
            &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            },
            &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            }
          },
          &quot;required&quot;: [
            &quot;company_mission&quot;,
            &quot;supports_sso&quot;,
            &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
            &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
          ]
        }
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Raw Content&quot;,
    &quot;metadata&quot;: {
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide&quot;,

      &quot;ogTitle&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;ogDescription&quot;: &quot;Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide&quot;,

      &quot;sourceURL&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/&quot;
    },
    &quot;json&quot;: {
      &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn&#039;t have to&quot;,
      &quot;supports_sso&quot;: true,
      &quot;is_open_source&quot;: false,
      &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Extracting without a schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;json&quot;],
      &quot;jsonOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission from the page.&quot;
      }
    }&#039;
```

### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;google.com&quot;,
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
        &quot;actions&quot;: [
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;textarea[title=\&quot;Search\&quot;]&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;write&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;firecrawl&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;press&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;ENTER&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;h3&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;screenshot&quot;}
        ]
    }&#039;
```

### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/batch/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;, &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview&quot;],
      &quot;formats&quot; : [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
    }&#039;
```



## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp
from firecrawl.firecrawl import ScrapeOptions

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=&quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;)

# Scrape a website:
scrape_status = app.scrape_url(
  &#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, 
  formats=[&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
)
print(scrape_status)

# Crawl a website:
crawl_status = app.crawl_url(
  &#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;,
  limit=100,
  scrape_options=ScrapeOptions(
    formats=[&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;],),
  poll_interval=30
)
print(crawl_status)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python
class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int 
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):
    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., description=&quot;Top 5 stories&quot;)

json_config = JsonConfig(schema=TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema())

llm_extraction_result = app.scrape_url(&#039;https://news.ycombinator.com&#039;, formats=[&quot;json&quot;], json=json_config)

print(llm_extraction_result.json)
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

```js
import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from &#039;@mendable/firecrawl-js&#039;;

const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: &quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;});

// Scrape a website
const scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {
  formats: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;],
});

if (scrapeResponse) {
  console.log(scrapeResponse)
}

// Crawl a website
const crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;],
  }
} satisfies CrawlParams, true, 30) satisfies CrawlStatusResponse;

if (crawlResponse) {
  console.log(crawlResponse)
}
```


### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:

```js
import FirecrawlApp from &quot;@mendable/firecrawl-js&quot;;
import { z } from &quot;zod&quot;;

const app = new FirecrawlApp({
  apiKey: &quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
});

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe(&quot;Top 5 stories on Hacker News&quot;),
});

const scrapeResult = await app

# Installation

## Docker with SQLite

```bash 
docker run -d \
  --name noco \
  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/nocodb:/usr/app/data/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  nocodb/nocodb:latest
  ```

## Docker with PG
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name noco \
  -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/nocodb:/usr/app/data/ \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NC_DB=&quot;pg://host.docker.internal:5432?u=root&amp;p=password&amp;d=d1&quot; \
  -e NC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=&quot;569a1821-0a93-45e8-87ab-eb857f20a010&quot; \
  nocodb/nocodb:latest
```

## Nix

```
nix run github:nocodb/nocodb
```

## NixOS
To use NocoDB as a NixOS module, a flake.nix would be as follows:

```
{
  description = &quot;Bane&#039;s NixOS configuration&quot;;

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = &quot;github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable&quot;;
    nocodb.url = &quot;github:nocodb/nocodb&quot;;
  };

  outputs = inputs@{ nixpkgs, nocodb, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = &quot;x86_64-linux&quot;;
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix
          nocodb.nixosModules.nocodb

          {
            services.nocodb.enable = true;
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## Auto-upstall
Auto-upstall is a single command that sets up NocoDB on a server for production usage.
Behind the scenes it auto-generates docker-compose for you.

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) &lt;(mktemp)
```

Auto-upstall does the following: 🕊
- 🐳 Automatically installs all pre-requisites like docker, docker-compose
- 🚀 Automatically installs NocoDB with PostgreSQL, Redis, Minio, Traefik gateway using Docker Compose. 🐘 🗄️ 🌐
- 🔄 Automatically upgrades NocoDB to the latest version when you run the command again.
- 🔒 Automatically setups SSL and also renews it. Needs a domain or subdomain as input while installation.
&gt; install.nocodb.com/noco.sh script can be found [here in our github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocodb/nocodb/develop/docker-compose/1_Auto_Upstall/noco.sh)

# Why are we building this?

Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, abrupt price changes &amp; most importantly a glass ceiling on what&#039;s possible in the future.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases that is open source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on the internet.

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](README.ja-JP.md)

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This is a demo version currently supporting Chinese only. A full-featured version with better customization and English content support will be released later.

**_Elegant reading of real-time and hottest news_**

## Features

- Clean and elegant UI design for optimal reading experience
- Real-time updates on trending news
- GitHub OAuth login with data synchronization
- 30-minute default cache duration (logged-in users can force refresh)
- Adaptive scraping interval (minimum 2 minutes) based on source update frequency to optimize resource usage and prevent IP bans
- support MCP server

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;newsnow&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;-y&quot;,
        &quot;newsnow-mcp-server&quot;
      ],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;BASE_URL&quot;: &quot;https://newsnow.busiyi.world&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
You can change the `BASE_URL` to your own domain.

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment

For deployments without login and caching:

1. Fork this repository
2. Import to platforms like Cloudflare Page or Vercel

### Cloudflare Page Configuration

- Build command: `pnpm run build`
- Output directory: `dist/output/public`

### GitHub OAuth Setup

1. [Create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. No special permissions required
3. Set callback URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain)
4. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret

### Environment Variables

Refer to `example.env.server`. For local development, rename it to `.env.server` and configure:

```env
# Github Client ID
G_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

### Database Support

Supported database connectors: https://db0.unjs.io/connectors
**Cloudflare D1 Database** is recommended.

1. Create D1 database in Cloudflare Worker dashboard
2. Configure database_id and database_name in wrangler.toml
3. If wrangler.toml doesn&#039;t exist, rename example.wrangler.toml and modify configurations
4. Changes will take effect on next deployment

### Docker Deployment

In project root directory:

```sh
docker compose up
```

You can also set Environment Variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Development

&gt; [!Note]
&gt; Requires Node.js &gt;= 20

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

### Adding Data Sources

Refer to `shared/sources` and `server/sources` directories. The project provides complete type definitions and a clean architecture.

For detailed instructions on how to add new sources, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

- Add **multi-language support** (English, Chinese, more to come).
- Improve **personalization options** (category-based news, saved preferences).
- Expand **data sources** to cover global news in multiple languages.

**_release when ready_**
