## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it&#039;s an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Preview

![video-preview](.assets/perplexica-preview.gif)

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can utilize local LLMs such as Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, and Mistral.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user&#039;s query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
- **API**: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI&#039;s models**.
   - `CUSTOM_OPENAI`: Your OpenAI-API-compliant local server URL, model name, and API key. You should run your local server with host set to `0.0.0.0`, take note of which port number it is running on, and then use that port number to set `API_URL = http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. You must specify the model name, such as `MODEL_NAME = &quot;unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_XL&quot;`. Finally, set `API_KEY` to the appropriate value. If you have not defined an API key, just put anything you want in-between the quotation marks: `API_KEY = &quot;whatever-you-want-but-not-blank&quot;` **You only need to configure these settings if you want to use a local OpenAI-compliant server, such as Llama.cpp&#039;s [`llama-server`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md)**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama&#039;s models instead of OpenAI&#039;s**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq&#039;s hosted models**.
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your Anthropic API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models**.
   - `Gemini`: Your Gemini API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Google&#039;s models**.
   - `DEEPSEEK`: Your Deepseek API key. **Only needed if you want Deepseek models.**
   - `AIMLAPI`: Your AI/ML API key. **Only needed if you want to use AI/ML API models and embeddings.**

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. After populating the configuration run `npm i`.
4. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build`.
5. Finally, start the app by running `npm run start`

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like updating, etc.

### Troubleshooting

#### Local OpenAI-API-Compliant Servers

If Perplexica tells you that you haven&#039;t configured any chat model providers, ensure that:

1. Your server is running on `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) and on the same port you put in the API URL.
2. You have specified the correct model name loaded by your local LLM server.
3. You have specified the correct API key, or if one is not defined, you have put *something* in the API key field and not left it empty.

#### Ollama Connection Errors

If you&#039;re encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama&#039;s API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://&lt;private_ip_of_host&gt;:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you&#039;re using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment=&quot;OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434&quot;`. (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with `systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser&#039;s search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser&#039;s settings.
2. Navigate to the &#039;Search Engines&#039; section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser&#039;s search bar.

## Using Perplexica&#039;s API

Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.

For more details, check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/API/SEARCH.md).

## Expose Perplexica to network

Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/assets/12318111/d6ac5664-c237-4200-a7c2-a4a00691b485&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## 🎬 Get Started

### 📝 Prerequisites

- CPU &gt;= 4 cores
- RAM &gt;= 16 GB
- Disk &gt;= 50 GB
- Docker &gt;= 24.0.0 &amp; Docker Compose &gt;= v2.26.1
- [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/): Required only if you intend to use the code executor (sandbox) feature of RAGFlow.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux), see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 🚀 Start up the server

1. Ensure `vm.max_map_count` &gt;= 262144:

   &gt; To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; $ sysctl vm.max_map_count
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; # In this case, we set it to 262144:
   &gt; $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the
   &gt; `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```

2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   ```

3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don&#039;t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.
&gt; If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.

   &gt; The command below downloads the `v0.20.5-slim` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.20.5-slim`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server. For example: set `RAGFLOW_IMAGE=infiniflow/ragflow:v0.20.5` for the full edition `v0.20.5`.

   ```bash
   $ cd ragflow/docker
   # Use CPU for embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

   # To use GPU to accelerate embedding and DeepDoc tasks:
   # docker compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up -d
   ```

   | RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?                  |
   |-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
   | v0.20.5           | &amp;approx;9       | :heavy_check_mark:    | Stable release           |
   | v0.20.5-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                   | Stable release            |
   | nightly           | &amp;approx;9       | :heavy_check_mark:    | _Unstable_ nightly build |
   | nightly-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                   | _Unstable_ nightly build  |

4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:

   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f ragflow-server
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ```bash

         ____   ___    ______ ______ __
        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __
       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /
      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /
     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/

    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
   ```

   &gt; If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network anormal`
   &gt; error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.

5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.
   &gt; With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default
   &gt; HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.
6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update
   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.

   &gt; See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.

   _The show is on!_

## 🔧 Configurations

When it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:

- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and
  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.
- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.

&gt; The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service
&gt; configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.

To update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`
to `&lt;YOUR_SERVING_PORT&gt;:80`.

Updates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:

&gt; ```bash
&gt; $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
&gt; ```

### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity

RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:

1. Stop all running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.

2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.

3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.

## 🔧 Build a Docker image without embedding models

This image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg LIGHTEN=1 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly-slim .
```

## 🔧 Build a Docker image including embedding models

This image is approximately 9 GB in size. As it includes embedding models, it relies on external LLM services only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

## 🔨 Launch service from source for development

1. Install `uv` and `pre-commit`, or skip this step if they are already installed:

   ```bash
   pipx install uv pre-commit
   ```

2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   cd ragflow/
   uv sync --python 3.10 --all-extras # install RAGFlow dependent python modules
   uv run download_deps.py
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d
   ```

   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:

   ```
   127.0.0.1       es01 infinity mysql minio redis sandbox-executor-manager
   ```

4. If you cannot access HuggingFace, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to use a mirror site:

   ```bash
   export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   ```

5. If your operating system does not have jemalloc, please install it as follows:

   ```bash
   # ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libjemalloc-dev
   # centos
   sudo yum install jemalloc
   # mac
   sudo brew install jemalloc
   ```

6. Launch backend service:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
   bash docker/launch_backend_service.sh
   ```

7. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```

8. Launch frontend service:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0daf462c-a24d-4496-a66f-92533534e187)

9. Stop RAGFlow front-end and back-end service after development is complete:

   ```bash
   pkill -f &quot;ragflow_server.py|task_executor.py&quot;
   ```

## Downloads

See the [releases](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/releases) page and
download the right package for your system.

### macOS

macOS 11 or later is required.

Download either the PKG (installer) or DMG (image) package from the
[releases](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/releases) page. Both arm64
(M1 chip or newer) and amd64 (Intel) variants are available.

All binary packages are built on macOS 14 and should be compatible with newer
systems.

#### Homebrew

Run the following command:

```sh
brew install --cask freelens
```

### Linux

Linux with GNU C Library 2.34 or later is required. It is provided ie. by
Debian 12, Fedora 35, Mint 21, openSUSE Leap 15.4, Ubuntu 22.04 and by
rolling release distributions like Arch, Manjaro or Tumbleweed.

Download DEB or RPM (package) or AppImage (executable) from the
[releases](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/releases) page. Both arm64
(aarch64) and amd64 (x86_64) variants are available.

All binary packages are built on Ubuntu 22.04 and should be compatible with
new systems.

#### AppImage

The Linux AppImage file requires libz.so and libfuse.so.2. You can add them
by running:

```sh
sudo apt install libfuse2 zlib1g-dev
```

Run the application with additional arguments:

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --&gt;
```sh
./Freelens*.AppImage --no-sandbox --ozone-platform-hint=auto --enable-features=WebRTCPipeWireCapturer --enable-features=WaylandWindowDecorations --disable-gpu-compositing
```
&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 --&gt;

#### Flatpak

The package is available on the
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/app.freelens.Freelens) App Store for
Linux.

Use GNOME Software application or run the following commands:

```sh
flatpak install flathub app.freelens.Freelens
flatpak run app.freelens.Freelens
```

The application is sandboxed. It includes bundled `kubectl` and `helm`
commands and uses the `~/.kube/config` file by default.

Flatpak adds wrappers for the `aws`, `doctl`, `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`, and
`kubelogin` tools, running them as commands from the host system.

The terminal uses `/bin/sh` by default, but it can be switched to, for
example, `/bin/bash` for a sandboxed environment or `/app/bin/host-spawn` for
a host environment.

#### Snap

The package is available on the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/freelens) Store
for Linux.

Use App Center application or run the following command:

```sh
snap install freelens --classic
```

Windows 10 or later is required.

Download the EXE (NSIS) or MSI installers from the
[releases](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/releases) page.

Both the x64 (amd64) and arm64 versions of the Windows binaries are provided.
However, an EXE installer (NSIS) itself is x86 binary only even if it installs
arm64 application and then installs to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Freelens` path
by default.

The version of the MSI package has the last 4th digit always `0` and this is a
limitation of this package format.

#### WinGet

The package is available in
[WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/Freelensapp.Freelens) Community
[repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs).

Run the following command:

```powershell
winget install Freelensapp.Freelens
```

The `--silent` option is supported to suppress all UI.

The `--scope user` or `--scope machine` option can be used to install it
either to local user directory or to `C:\Program Files`.

WinGet installs the application from EXE installer (NSIS).

#### Scoop

The package is available in the
[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=freelens&amp;s=1&amp;d=0) command-line installer for
Windows.

Run the following command:

```powershell

npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. (Optional) Skip permissions check for faster setup
# Only use if you understand the security implications
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

💡 **Windows Note**: If you encounter SQLite errors, Claude Flow will automatically use in-memory storage. For persistent storage options, see our [Windows guide](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow/blob/main/docs/windows-installation.md).

### 🎯 **Instant Alpha Testing**

```bash
# 1. Initialize Claude Flow with enhanced MCP setup (auto-configures permissions!)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force

# 2. Explore all revolutionary capabilities  
npx claude-flow@alpha --help

# 3a. Quick AI coordination (recommended for most tasks)
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;build me a REST API&quot; --claude

# 3b. OR launch the full hive-mind system (for complex projects)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;build enterprise system&quot; --claude
```

### 🚀 **Quick Start with Flow Nexus**

```bash
# 1. Initialize Flow Nexus only (minimal setup)
npx claude-flow init --flow-nexus

# 2. Register and login (use MCP tools in Claude Code)
mcp__flow-nexus__user_register({ email: &quot;your@email.com&quot;, password: &quot;secure&quot; })
mcp__flow-nexus__user_login({ email: &quot;your@email.com&quot;, password: &quot;secure&quot; })

# 3. Deploy your first cloud swarm
mcp__flow-nexus__swarm_init({ topology: &quot;mesh&quot;, maxAgents: 5 })
mcp__flow-nexus__sandbox_create({ template: &quot;node&quot;, name: &quot;api-dev&quot; })
```

### 🤔 **Swarm vs Hive-Mind: Which to Use?**

| Feature | `swarm` Command | `hive-mind` Command |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Best For** | Quick tasks, single objectives | Complex projects, persistent sessions |
| **Setup** | Instant - no configuration needed | Interactive wizard setup |
| **Session** | Temporary coordination | Persistent with resume capability |
| **Memory** | Task-scoped | Project-wide with SQLite storage |
| **Agents** | Auto-spawned for task | Manual control with specializations |
| **Use When** | &quot;Build X&quot;, &quot;Fix Y&quot;, &quot;Analyze Z&quot; | Multi-feature projects, team coordination |

**Quick Rule:** Start with `swarm` for most tasks. Use `hive-mind` when you need persistent sessions or complex multi-agent coordination.

## 🎯 **Typical Workflows - Your &quot;Happy Path&quot; Guide**

### **New to Claude-Flow? Start Here!**

Confused about `.hive-mind` and `.swarm` directories? Not sure when to create new hives? Here are the most common workflow patterns:

#### **🚀 Pattern 1: Single Feature Development**
```bash
# Initialize once per feature/task
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;Implement user authentication&quot; --claude

# Continue working on SAME feature (reuse existing hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query &quot;authentication&quot; --recent
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;Add password reset functionality&quot; --continue-session
```

#### **🏗️ Pattern 2: Multi-Feature Project**
```bash
# Project-level initialization (once per project)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force --project-name &quot;my-app&quot;

# Feature 1: Authentication (new hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;auth-system&quot; --namespace auth --claude

# Feature 2: User management (separate hive)  
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;user-management&quot; --namespace users --claude

# Resume Feature 1 later (use session ID from spawn output)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-xxxxx-xxxxx
```

#### **🔍 Pattern 3: Research &amp; Analysis**
```bash
# Start research session
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;Research microservices patterns&quot; --agents researcher,analyst --claude

# Continue research in SAME session
npx claude-flow@alpha memory stats  # See what&#039;s been learned
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm &quot;Deep dive into API gateway patterns&quot; --continue-session
```

### **🤔 When Should I Create a New Hive?**

| Situation | Action | Command |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Same objective/feature** | Continue existing hive | `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume &lt;session-id&gt;` |
| **New feature in same project** | Create new hive with namespace | `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;new-feature&quot; --namespace feature-name` |
| **Completely different project** | New directory + init | `mkdir new-project &amp;&amp; cd new-project &amp;&amp; npx claude-flow@alpha init` |
| **Experimenting/testing** | Temporary hive | `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn &quot;experiment&quot; --temp` |

### **📁 Understanding &quot;Empty&quot; Directories**

**Don&#039;t panic if directories seem empty!** Claude-Flow uses SQLite databases that may not show files in directory listings:

```bash
# Check what&#039;s actually stored (even if directories look empty)
npx claude-flow@alpha memory stats        # See memory data
npx claude-flow@alpha memory list         # List all namespaces  
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status    # See active hives

# Your project structure after initialization:
# .hive-mind/     &lt;- Contains config.json + SQLite session data
# .swarm/         &lt;- Contains memory.db (SQLite database)
# memory/         &lt;- Agent-specific memories (created when agents spawn)
# coordination/   &lt;- Active workflow files (created during tasks)
```

### **🔄 Continuing Previous Work**

```bash
# See what you were working on
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query --recent --limit 5

# List all sessions to find the one you want
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind sessions

# Resume specific session by ID
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-xxxxx-xxxxx
```

---

## 🪝 **Advanced Hooks System**

### **Automated Workflow Enhancement**
Claude-Flow v2.0.0 introduces a powerful hooks system that automates coordination and enhances every operation:

```bash
# Hooks automatically trigger on operations
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force  # Auto-configures MCP servers &amp; hooks
```

### **Available Hooks**

#### **Pre-Operation Hooks**
- **`pre-task`**: Auto-assigns agents based on task complexity
- **`pre-search`**: Caches searches for improved performance  
- **`pre-edit`**: Validates files and prepares resources
- **`pre-command`**: Security validation before execution

#### **Post-Operation Hooks**
- **`post-edit`**: Auto-formats code using language-specific tools
- **`post-task`**: Trains neural patterns from successful operations
- **`post-command`**: Updates memory with operation context
- **`notification`**: Real-time progress updates

#### **Session Hooks**
- **`session-start`**: Restores previous context automatically
- **`session-end`**: Generates summaries and persists state
- **`session-restore`**: Loads memory from previous sessions

### **Hook Configuration**
```json
// .claude/settings.json (auto-configured)
{
  &quot;hooks&quot;: {
    &quot;preEditHook&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;claude-flow&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, &quot;pre-edit&quot;, &quot;--file&quot;, &quot;${file}&quot;, &quot;--auto-assign-agents&quot;, &quot;true&quot;],
      &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: false
    },
    &quot;postEditHook&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;, 
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;claude-flow&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, &quot;post-edit&quot;, &quot;--file&quot;, &quot;${file}&quot;, &quot;--format&quot;, &quot;true&quot;],
      &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: true
    },
    &quot;sessionEndHook&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;claude-flow&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, &quot;session-end&quot;, &quot;--generate-summary&quot;, &quot;true&quot;],
      &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### **Using Hooks in Claude Code**

Hooks integrate seamlessly with Claude Code&#039;s workflow:

1. **Automatic Triggering**: Hooks fire automatically during Claude Code operations
2. **Context Awareness**: Each hook receives relevant context (file paths, commands, etc.)
3. **Non-Blocking**: Hooks run asynchronously to maintain performance
4. **Configurable**: Enable/disable specific hooks as needed

### **Hook Examples**

```bash
# Manual hook execution
npx claude-flow hooks pre-task --description &quot;Build REST API&quot; --auto-spawn-agents

# Post-edit with formatting
npx claude-flow hooks post-edit --file &quot;src/api.js&quot; --format --train-neural

# Session management
npx claude-flow hooks session-end --generate-summary --persist-state
```

### **Fixing Hook Variable Interpolation**

If you&#039;re experiencing issues with `${file}` or `${command}` variables not working in your hooks (common with Claude Code 1.0.51+), use the `fix-hook-variables` command:

```bash
# Fix all found settings.json files
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables

# Fix specific file
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables .claude/settings.json

# Create test configuration
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables --test
```

This command automatically transforms legacy variable syntax to working environment variables:
- `${file}` → `$CLAUDE_EDITED_FILE`
- `${command}` → `$CLAUDE_COMMAND`
- `${tool}` → `$CLAUDE_TOOL`

### Installation

```bash
# YOLO
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Package managers
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest        # or bun/pnpm/yarn
brew install sst/tap/opencode      # macOS and Linux
paru -S opencode-bin               # Arch Linux
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Documentation

For more info on how to configure opencode [**head over to our docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).

### Contributing

opencode is an opinionated tool so any fundamental feature needs to go through a
design process with the core team.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; We do not accept PRs for core features.

However we still merge a ton of PRs - you can contribute:

- Bug fixes
- Improvements to LLM performance
- Support for new providers
- Fixes for env specific quirks
- Missing standard behavior
- Documentation

Take a look at the git history to see what kind of PRs we end up merging.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you do not follow the above guidelines we might close your PR.

To run opencode locally you need.

- Bun
- Golang 1.24.x

And run.

```bash
$ bun install
$ bun dev
```

#### Development Notes

**API Client**: After making changes to the TypeScript API endpoints in `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts`, you will need the opencode team to generate a new stainless sdk for the clients.

### FAQ

#### How is this different than Claude Code?

It&#039;s very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although Anthropic is recommended, opencode can be used with OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- A focus on TUI. opencode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what&#039;s possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow opencode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What&#039;s the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).

# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge
of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We&#039;re using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That&#039;s where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.

## Stay Up-to-Date

Cal.com officially launched as v.1.0 on the 15th of September 2021 and we&#039;ve come a long way so far. Watch **releases** of this repository to be notified of future updates:

![cal-star-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/154853944-a9e3c999-3da3-4048-b149-b4f73893c6fb.gif)

&lt;!-- GETTING STARTED --&gt;

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.

- Node.js (Version: &gt;=18.x)
- PostgreSQL (Version: &gt;=13.x)
- Yarn _(recommended)_

&gt; If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you may want to obtain additional credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below under the [integrations section](#integrations).

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE). To clone in a private repository, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales)

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

   &gt; If you are on Windows, run the following command on `gitbash` with admin privileges: &lt;br&gt; &gt; `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git` &lt;br&gt;
   &gt; See [docs](https://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windows#enable-symbolic-links) for more details.

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Install packages with yarn

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.

5. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project&#039;s requirements as instructed by the docs, &quot;nvm&quot; (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install &amp;&amp; nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Quick start with `yarn dx`

&gt; - **Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed**
&gt; - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console

```sh
yarn dx
```

#### Development tip
1. Add `export NODE_OPTIONS=“--max-old-space-size=16384”` to your shell script to increase the memory limit for the node process. Alternatively, you can run this in your terminal before running the app. Replace 16384 with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the node process.

2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` to your .env file to control the logging verbosity for all tRPC queries and mutations.\
   Where {level} can be one of the following:

   `0` for silly \
   `1` for trace \
   `2` for debug \
   `3` for info \
   `4` for warn \
   `5` for error \
   `6` for fatal

   When you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` in your .env file, it enables logging at that level and higher. Here&#039;s how it works:

   The logger will include all logs that are at the specified level or higher. For example: \

   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=2`, it will log from level 2 (debug) upwards, meaning levels 2 (debug), 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and (fatal) will be logged. \
   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3`, it will log from level 3 (info) upwards, meaning levels 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged, but level 2 (debug) and level 1 (trace) will be ignored. \

```sh
echo &#039;NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3&#039; &gt;&gt; .env
```

for Logger level to be set at info, for example.

#### Gitpod Setup

1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.

2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)

#### Manual setup

1. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Replace `&lt;user&gt;`, `&lt;pass&gt;`, `&lt;db-host&gt;`, and `&lt;db-port&gt;` with their applicable values

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&#039;postgresql://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@&lt;db-host&gt;:&lt;db-port&gt;&#039;
   ```

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;If you don&#039;t know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB&lt;/summary&gt;

   1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install postgres in your local (if you don&#039;t have it already).

   2. Create your own local db by executing `createDB &lt;DB name&gt;`

   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d &lt;DB name&gt;`

   4. Inside the psql shell execute `\conninfo`. And you will get the following info.  
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png)

   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this
      `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name`. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.

   &lt;/details&gt;

   If you don&#039;t want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app or render.

   - [Setup postgres DB with railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql)
   - [Setup postgres DB with render](https://render.com/docs/databases)

1. Copy and paste your `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` to `.env.appStore`.

1. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Run [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to view emails sent during development

   &gt; **_NOTE:_** Required when `E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED` is &quot;1&quot;

   ```sh
   docker pull mailhog/mailhog
   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
   ```

1. Run (in development mode)

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

#### Setting up your first user

##### Approach 1

1. Open [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:

   ```sh
   yarn db-studio
   ```

1. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
1. Fill out the fields `email`, `username`, `password`, and set `metadata` to empty `{}` (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
   &gt; New users are set on a `TRIAL` plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` file.
1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.

##### Approach 2

Seed the local db by running

```sh
cd packages/prisma
yarn db-seed
```

The above command will populate the local db with dummy users.

### E2E-Testing

Be sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
# In a terminal just run:
yarn test-e2e

# To open the last HTML report run:
yarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report
```

#### Resolving issues

##### E2E test browsers not installed

Run `npx playwright install` to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running `yarn test-e2e`:

```
Executable doesn&#039;t exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

### Upgrading from earlier versions

1. Pull the current version:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

1. Apply database migrations by running &lt;b&gt;one of&lt;/b&gt; the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   (This can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Check for `.env` variables changes

   ```sh
   yarn predev
   ```

1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   For a production build, run for example:

   ```sh
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

1. Enjoy the new version.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Model Context Protocol servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references to community-built servers and additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Typically, each MCP server is implemented with an MCP SDK:

- [C# MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk)
- [Go MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)
- [Java MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk)
- [Kotlin MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)
- [PHP MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk)
- [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- [Ruby MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ruby-sdk)
- [Rust MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk)
- [Swift MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk)

A general-purpose [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action intelligently detects when to activate based on your workflow context—whether responding to @claude mentions, issue assignments, or executing automation tasks with explicit prompts. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

## Features

- 🎯 **Intelligent Mode Detection**: Automatically selects the appropriate execution mode based on your workflow context—no configuration needed
- 🤖 **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- 🔍 **Code Review**: Analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements
- ✨ **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- 💬 **PR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub comments and PR reviews
- 🛠️ **Flexible Tool Access**: Access to GitHub APIs and file operations (additional tools can be enabled via configuration)
- 📋 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with checkboxes that dynamically update as Claude completes tasks
- 🏃 **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: The action executes entirely on your own GitHub runner (Anthropic API calls go to your chosen provider)
- ⚙️ **Simplified Configuration**: Unified `prompt` and `claude_args` inputs provide clean, powerful configuration aligned with Claude Code SDK

## 📦 Upgrading from v0.x?

**See our [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-guide.md)** for step-by-step instructions on updating your workflows to v1.0. The new version simplifies configuration while maintaining compatibility with most existing setups.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to set up this action is through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in the terminal. Just open `claude` and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

**Note**:

- You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
- This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. For AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI setup, see [docs/cloud-providers.md](./docs/cloud-providers.md).

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

React is an excellent tool for building front-end applications. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for literally anything you might need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming. It is also very flexible, you can write React applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since there is no pre-defined architecture that developers can follow, it often leads to a messy, inconsistent, and over-complicated codebase.

This repo attempts to present a way of creating React applications using some of the best tools in the ecosystem with a good project structure that scales very well. Based on my experience working with a lot of different codebases, this architecture turns out to be the most effective.

The goal here is to serve as a collection of resources and best practices when developing React applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application in a practical way and help developers write better applications.

Feel free to explore the sample app codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

## What makes a React application &quot;bulletproof&quot;?

This repo doesn&#039;t aim to be a silver bullet for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.

To get most out of it, do not get limited by the technologies used in this sample app, but rather focus on the principles and the concepts that are being presented here. The tools and libraries used here are just a suggestion, you can always replace them with something that fits your needs better. Sometimes, your project might require a slightly different approach, and that&#039;s totally fine.

&lt;/p&gt;

## The Idea

Learning a new language can be straightforward, but mastering it is the real challenge. While it&#039;s relatively easy to grasp the basics, developing strong communication or reading skills depends on having a solid vocabulary. To build this, you must learn words and phrases at various levels, yet exposure is key. For instance, if you&#039;ve studied English but don&#039;t live in an English-speaking country, advancing your skills becomes significantly harder. You can read books, watch movies, or browse blogs, but fully immersing yourself in the language is still difficult. Real progress often requires extra effort—studying and revisiting words and phrases encountered in your daily life.

However, this process can be inconvenient. You have to pause whatever you&#039;re doing to note new words, search their meanings, record them, and then review them later. This is time-consuming and tiring. As a result, although you might improve, the learning process can feel painfully slow and inefficient.

To solve this, I had an idea for an app that merges personalized learning with the efficiency of flashcards—a blend of Duolingo-like lessons and custom study lists.

In the previous version, you&#039;d read your book, encounter new words, create a list, manually add each word, and then practice. You&#039;d open the app, create a new list with details like &quot;Harry Potter Book,&quot; add the words you found, and the app would provide meanings so you could continue reading without interruption. Later you&#039;d practice with exercises and quizzes. This worked great when you were actively reading or consuming content, but what about when you just wanted to expand your vocabulary anytime, anywhere?

But here&#039;s where it gets exciting – **we&#039;ve added a new feature to discover and encounter new words**. Instead of manually hunting down vocabulary, you can now encounter words naturally with much less effort:

### 🌳 Vision Garden (My Personal Favorite!)

Imagine looking at images and describing them to discover new vocabulary. You can use LLM-generated images or real stock photos, describe what you see, and agent analyzes your description to suggest contextual vocabulary words you might not know. It&#039;s like having a personal tutor who shows you pictures and helps you expand your vocabulary naturally. The agent considers your current vocabulary and suggests words that fit your learning level and context.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/assets/vision-garden.png&quot; alt=&quot;Vision Garden&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

### 📚 Get New Words - Smart Vocabulary Discovery

Choose any context or topic you&#039;re interested in (like &quot;space exploration&quot; or &quot;cooking techniques&quot;), select your difficulty level, and let agent generate vocabulary words you don&#039;t already have. Then dive into interactive learning sessions where you can:

- **Know/Don&#039;t Know Interface**: Simple binary choice for each word
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveals definitions, examples, and visuals when you don&#039;t know the word
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Excludes words you already know, focuses on your chosen difficulty level
- **Visual Integration**: Generate images for words you&#039;re learning to create stronger memory connections
- **List Building**: Add learned words to existing lists or create new context-specific collections

No more manually searching for words – just pick a theme and difficulty, and get learning experience that adapts to your knowledge.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

### 🗣️ Voice Chat

This is where things get really interactive. Using OpenAI&#039;s voice agents you can have actual spoken conversations with an LLM tutor about your vocabulary words. Practice pronunciation, ask questions, and get instant feedback through natural speech. It&#039;s like having a language exchange partner available 24/7 who knows exactly what words you&#039;re learning. The voice agent has access to your list and help you learn the words you already have and it can add new words to your lists by using the tool.

&lt;/p&gt;

Once you&#039;ve discovered words through these methods, you can:

- **Learn**: Practice with 5 different question types (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching, true/false, and sentence completion) - all configurable in your settings
- **Quiz**: Test your knowledge and track your progress with learned points
- **Voice Practice**: Have conversations about your vocabulary with the LLM voice tutor
- **Light Reading**: Generate reading passages that highlight your vocabulary words in context

&lt;/p&gt;

### 🔍 Word Detail Pages - Deep Dive Into Every Word

Each word in your vocabulary gets its own comprehensive page where you can:
- **Context Explorer**: See how the same word appears across different lists with different meanings and track your progress in each context
- **Example Generator**: Create contextual example sentences with translations and detailed usage notes
- **Visual Learning**: Generate LLM images or find stock photos that represent the word in its specific context
- **Similar Words Discovery**: Find synonyms and interchangeable words with examples and usage notes
- **Smart Collection**: Add discovered similar words to your existing lists or create new context-specific lists

&lt;/p&gt;


### 🔊 Audio Pronunciation System - Every Word Has A Voice

Pronunciation for immersive learning.

### Multi-Language

The app now supports learning **any language using any language**. Want to learn Japanese using Turkish? Or practice advanced English while getting explanations in Spanish? Just configure your native language (base) and target language in settings. The LLM even validates specific language variants like &quot;Japanese with Hiragana&quot; or &quot;Brazilian Portuguese&quot;.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

### Template Library

Jump-start your learning with curated vocabulary lists. Browse templates by category, difficulty, and tags, then clone them to create your own customized lists.

### 📝 Classic Word Lists - The Original Power

Of course, the original way still works! Create your own context-aware lists the traditional way:
- **Create Custom Lists**: Make lists with any name, description, and context (like &quot;Harry Potter Book,&quot; &quot;Business Meeting Vocabulary,&quot; etc.)
- **Add Words Instantly**: Just type a word and - it&#039;s automatically defined in your chosen context
- **Context-Aware Definitions**: Each word gets its meaning based on your list&#039;s context, so &quot;bank&quot; means something different in &quot;Financial Terms&quot; vs &quot;Geography Vocabulary&quot;
- **Manual Control**: Perfect for when you encounter specific words while reading, watching movies, or in conversations
- **Flexible Organization**: Organize your vocabulary exactly how you want it

This is still the most direct way to build your vocabulary when you know exactly what words you want to learn!

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/assets/light-reading.png&quot; alt=&quot;Light Reading&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

The key advantage is that the app keeps your learning tied to the context in which you originally saw the words. By returning to them in their original setting, you strengthen those specific neural pathways, speeding up retention and making learning significantly more effective.

**In short, it&#039;s like having a personalized Duolingo where you can create and learn from your own lists, but with the added ehancements of natural word discovery and voice interaction. It&#039;s a powerful way to immerse yourself in the language and make steady progress.**

```

### Database Setup

Install and start MongoDB:

**Local MongoDB:**
```bash
# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongodb

# Windows
# Download and install from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
```

**Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud):**
1. Create a free account at https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get your connection string

### Configuration

Create `.env` files:

Backend `.env`:
```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key_here  # Optional for Vision Garden stock photos

```
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/wordpecker
```

### Development

The database will be automatically created when you first start the backend. No manual database setup is required as MongoDB is schemaless and Mongoose will handle collection creation.

Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Docker Setup (Recommended)

    &lt;td&gt;Build with the language that best fits your project. Genkit provides SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Python (Alpha) with consistent APIs and capabilities across all supported languages.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Deploy AI logic to any environment that supports your chosen programming language, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/firebase&quot;&gt;Cloud Functions for Firebase&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/cloud-run&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Run&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/deploy-node&quot;&gt;third-party platforms&lt;/a&gt;,
    with or without Google services.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Accelerate AI development with a purpose-built, local &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/devtools&quot;&gt;CLI and Developer UI&lt;/a&gt;. Test prompts and
    flows against individual inputs or datasets, compare outputs from different models, debug with detailed execution traces, and use immediate visual feedback to iterate rapidly on prompts.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Ship AI features with confidence using comprehensive production monitoring. Track model performance, and request volumes, latency, and error rates in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/observability/getting-started&quot;&gt; purpose-built dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. Identify issues quickly with detailed observability metrics, and ensure your AI features meet quality and performance targets in real-world usage.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## How does it work?

Genkit simplifies AI integration with an open-source SDK and unified APIs that
work across various model providers and programming languages. It abstracts away complexity so you can focus on delivering great user experiences.

Some key features offered by Genkit include:

* [Text and image generation](https://genkit.dev/docs/models)
* [Type-safe, structured data generation](https://genkit.dev/docs/models#structured-output)
* [Tool calling](https://genkit.dev/docs/tool-calling)
* [Prompt templating](https://genkit.dev/docs/dotprompt)
* [Persisted chat interfaces](https://genkit.dev/docs/chat)
* [AI workflows](https://genkit.dev/docs/flows)
* [AI-powered data retrieval (RAG)](https://genkit.dev/docs/rag)

Genkit is designed for server-side deployment in multiple language environments, and also provides seamless client-side integration through dedicated helpers and [client SDKs](https://genkit.dev/docs/firebase).

## Implementation path

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Choose your language and model provider&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Select the Genkit SDK for your preferred language (JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, or Python (Alpha)). Choose a model provider like &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/plugins/google-genai&quot;&gt;Google Gemini&lt;/a&gt; or Anthropic, and get an API key. Some providers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://genkit.dev/docs/plugins/vertex-ai&quot;&gt;Vertex AI&lt;/a&gt;, may rely on a different means of authentication.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Install the SDK and initialize&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Install the Genkit SDK, model-provider package of your choice, and the Genkit CLI. Import the Genkit and provider packages and initialize Genkit with the provider API key.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Write and test AI features&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Use the Genkit SDK to build AI features for your use case, from basic text generation to complex multi-step workflows and agents. Use the CLI and Developer UI to help you rapidly test and iterate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Deploy and monitor&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Deploy your AI features to Firebase, Google Cloud Run, or any environment that supports your chosen programming language. Integrate them into your app, and monitor them in production in the Firebase console.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## 💭 **The Story Behind ClaraVerse**

&gt; **&quot;Why can&#039;t everything be in a single app? Why do we need to jump between different AI tools and pay multiple subscriptions?&quot;**

**Here&#039;s what happened to us (and probably you too):**

We found ourselves constantly jumping between different AI apps — tired of paying for Claude subscriptions, then installing LM Studio for local models, then N8N for automation, then Ollama for model management, then OpenWebUI for a better chat interface...

When using Ollama, downloading models was the only way to get started — but then we were stuck with limited chat features. LM Studio was good for models, but the chat experience felt basic. We&#039;d end up running everything in the background while building UIs and generating images separately.

**That&#039;s when it hit us: Why can&#039;t everything be in a single app?**

ClaraVerse is our answer to that question.

&gt; ClaraVerse is not another OpenWebUI (which is excellent for chat) or Ollama - everything is just scattered around and I&#039;m trying to build a single app where people can just install it and use it. 

&lt;br/&gt;

## 🎯 **The Problem**

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

| **The Subscription Hell** 💸 | **The Context-Loss Nightmare** 🔄 |
|:---|:---|
| • Claude Pro: **$20/month**&lt;br/&gt;• ChatGPT Plus: **$20/month**&lt;br/&gt;• GitHub Copilot: **$10/month**&lt;br/&gt;• Midjourney: **$10/month**&lt;br/&gt;• N8N Cloud: **$20/month**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Total: $960/year** 😱 | • Chat in Claude → Code in VScode&lt;br/&gt;• Prompt in LLM → Use it in ComfyUI&lt;br/&gt;• Deploy with Ollama → Run in OpenWebUI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Lost context with every switch** 🤦 |

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

## 💭 **A Note From The Developer regarding incomplete features, bugs and docs**

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

### **Building ClaraVerse**

### **Solo Developer**

`9-6 Day Job` `Night Coding` 
`Weekend Builds` `3 AM Commits`

**One person. Three platforms.**
**Just having fun in doing this.**

&lt;/td&gt;

### **Community Heroes**

`Discord Testers` `Bug Hunters`
`Coffee Supporters` `PR Contributors`

**You make this possible.**
**Every single day.**

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Read the Full Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&gt; **&quot;Why are some docs incomplete? Why does this feature need work?&quot;**

Here&#039;s the honest truth...

I&#039;m a **single developer** building ClaraVerse during nights and weekends while working a **9-6 day job**. I&#039;m maintaining **3 platforms**, fixing bugs, adding features, answering Discord questions, reviewing PRs, and somehow trying to keep documentation updated.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

**The Reality Check:**
- Docs written with **Claude &amp; GPT** during my **2-3 hours of free time**
- Some nights too exhausted to write proper commit messages
- Every feature request matters, but time is limited
- Your patience literally keeps this project alive

&lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🤖 AI Models &amp; Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### **Model Compatibility**

✅ **Auto-Import From:**
- Ollama models
- LM Studio models

3. Ensure Ollama running: `ollama serve`
4. Restart ClaraVerse

**Memory Optimization:**
- Use smaller models (7B vs 70B)
- Close unused tabs
- Restart periodically

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
  &lt;kbd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎨 Features &amp; Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### **LumaUI Issues**

- Try simpler project first

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

### **Image Generation**

**Generation Fails?**
- Reduce resolution (512x512)
- Check GPU memory (6GB+)
- Close GPU applications
- Try CPU mode (slower)

**Quality Issues?**
- Increase steps (20-50)
- Try different models
- Adjust CFG scale

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;sub&gt;💡 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: Multi-Tool Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

You can run **all tools simultaneously** - that&#039;s the magic of ClaraVerse! 
Clara AI + LumaUI + ComfyUI can all share context and work together.

&lt;/details&gt;

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with comprehensive access to n8n node documentation, properties, and operations. Deploy in minutes to give Claude and other AI assistants deep knowledge about n8n&#039;s 525+ workflow automation nodes.

## Overview

n8n-MCP serves as a bridge between n8n&#039;s workflow automation platform and AI models, enabling them to understand and work with n8n nodes effectively. It provides structured access to:

- 📚 **535 n8n nodes** from both n8n-nodes-base and @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain
- 🔧 **Node properties** - 99% coverage with detailed schemas
- ⚡ **Node operations** - 63.6% coverage of available actions
- 📄 **Documentation** - 90% coverage from official n8n docs (including AI nodes)
- 🤖 **AI tools** - 263 AI-capable nodes detected with full documentation


## ⚠️ Important Safety Warning

**NEVER edit your production workflows directly with AI!** Always:
- 🔄 **Make a copy** of your workflow before using AI tools
- 🧪 **Test in development** environment first
- 💾 **Export backups** of important workflows
- ⚡ **Validate changes** before deploying to production

AI results can be unpredictable. Protect your work!

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get n8n-MCP running in 5 minutes:

[![n8n-mcp Video Quickstart Guide](./thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/5CccjiLLyaY?si=Z62SBGlw9G34IQnQ&amp;t=343)

### Option 1: npx (Fastest - No Installation!) 🚀

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation needed!)
npx n8n-mcp
```

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Basic configuration (documentation tools only):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;n8n-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MCP_MODE&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
        &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
        &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT&quot;: &quot;true&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Full configuration (with n8n management tools):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;n8n-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;MCP_MODE&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
        &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot;: &quot;error&quot;,
        &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT&quot;: &quot;true&quot;,
        &quot;N8N_API_URL&quot;: &quot;https://your-n8n-instance.com&quot;,
        &quot;N8N_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-api-key&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; **Note**: npx will download and run the latest version automatically. The package includes a pre-built database with all n8n node information.

**Configuration file locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Restart Claude Desktop after updating configuration** - That&#039;s it! 🎉

### Option 2: Docker (Easy &amp; Isolated) 🐳

**Prerequisites:** Docker installed on your system

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📦 Install Docker&lt;/strong&gt; (click to expand)&lt;/summary&gt;

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install --cask docker

# Or download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Add your user to docker group (optional, to run without sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for this to take effect
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Option 1: Using winget (Windows Package Manager)
winget install Docker.DockerDesktop

# Option 2: Using Chocolatey
choco install docker-desktop

# Option 3: Download installer from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
docker --version
```
&lt;/details&gt;

```bash
# Pull the Docker image (~280MB, no n8n dependencies!)
docker pull ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest
```

&gt; **⚡ Ultra-optimized:** Our Docker image is 82% smaller than typical n8n images because it contains NO n8n dependencies - just the runtime MCP server with a pre-built database!

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Basic configuration (documentation tools only):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;MCP_MODE=stdio&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL=error&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Full configuration (with n8n management tools):**
```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;n8n-mcp&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;docker&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;run&quot;,
        &quot;-i&quot;,
        &quot;--rm&quot;,
        &quot;--init&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;MCP_MODE=stdio&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL=error&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_API_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com&quot;,
        &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key&quot;,
        &quot;ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

&gt;💡 Tip: If you’re running n8n locally on the same machine (e.g., via Docker), use http://host.docker.internal:5678 as the N8N_API_URL.

&gt; **Note**: The n8n API credentials are optional. Without them, you&#039;ll have access to all documentation and validation tools. With them, you&#039;ll additionally get workflow management capabilities (create, update, execute workflows).

**Important:** The `-i` flag is required for MCP stdio communication.

&gt; 🔧 If you encounter any issues with Docker, check our [Docker Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

**Configuration file locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Restart Claude Desktop after updating configuration** - That&#039;s it! 🎉

## 🤖 Claude Project Setup

For the best results when using n8n-MCP with Claude Projects, use these enhanced system instructions:

```markdown
You are an expert in n8n automation software using n8n-MCP tools. Your role is to design, build, and validate n8n workflows with maximum accuracy and efficiency.

## Core Workflow Process

1. **ALWAYS start new conversation with**: `tools_documentation()` to understand best practices and available tools.

2. **Template Discovery Phase** 
   - `search_templates_by_metadata({complexity: &quot;simple&quot;})` - Find skill-appropriate templates
   - `get_templates_for_task(&#039;webhook_processing&#039;)` - Get curated templates by task
   - `search_templates(&#039;slack notification&#039;)` - Text search for specific needs
   - `list_node_templates([&#039;n8n-nodes-base.slack&#039;])` - Find templates using specific nodes
   
   **Template filtering strategies**:
   - **For beginners**: `complexity: &quot;simple&quot;` and `maxSetupMinutes: 30`
   - **By role**: `targetAudience: &quot;marketers&quot;` or `&quot;developers&quot;` or `&quot;analysts&quot;`
   - **By time**: `maxSetupMinutes: 15` for quick wins
   - **By service**: `requiredService: &quot;openai&quot;` to find compatible templates

3. **Discovery Phase** - Find the right nodes (if no suitable template):
   - Think deeply about user request and the logic you are going to build to fulfill it. Ask follow-up questions to clarify the user&#039;s intent, if something is unclear. Then, proceed with the rest of your instructions.
   - `search_nodes({query: &#039;keyword&#039;})` - Search by functionality
   - `list_nodes({category: &#039;trigger&#039;})` - Browse by category
   - `list_ai_tools()` - See AI-capable nodes (remember: ANY node can be an AI tool!)

4. **Configuration Phase** - Get node details efficiently:
   - `get_node_essentials(nodeType)` - Start here! Only 10-20 essential properties
   - `search_node_properties(nodeType, &#039;auth&#039;)` - Find specific properties
   - `get_node_for_task(&#039;send_email&#039;)` - Get pre-configured templates
   - `get_node_documentation(nodeType)` - Human-readable docs when needed
   - It is good common practice to show a visual representation of the workflow architecture to the user and asking for opinion, before moving forward. 

5. **Pre-Validation Phase** - Validate BEFORE building:
   - `validate_node_minimal(nodeType, config)` - Quick required fields check
   - `validate_node_operation(nodeType, config, profile)` - Full operation-aware validation
   - Fix any validation errors before proceeding

6. **Building Phase** - Create or customize the workflow:
   - If using template: `get_template(templateId, {mode: &quot;full&quot;})`
   - **MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION**: When using a template, ALWAYS inform the user:
     - &quot;This workflow is based on a template by **[author.name]** (@[author.username])&quot;
     - &quot;View the original template at: [url]&quot;
     - Example: &quot;This workflow is based on a template by **David Ashby** (@cfomodz). View the original at: https://n8n.io/workflows/2414&quot;
   - Customize template or build from validated configurations
   - Connect nodes with proper structure
   - Add error handling where appropriate
   - Use expressions like $json, $node[&quot;NodeName&quot;].json
   - Build the workflow in an artifact for easy editing downstream (unless the user asked to create in n8n instance)

7. **Workflow Validation Phase** - Validate complete workflow:
   - `validate_workflow(workflow)` - Complete validation including connections
   - `validate_workflow_connections(workflow)` - Check structure and AI tool connections
   - `validate_workflow_expressions(workflow)` - Validate all n8n expressions
   - Fix any issues found before deployment

8. **Deployment Phase** (if n8n API configured):
   - `n8n_create_workflow(workflow)` - Deploy validated workflow
   - `n8n_validate_workflow({id: &#039;workflow-id&#039;})` - Post-deployment validation
   - `n8n_update_partial_workflow()` - Make incremental updates using diffs
   - `n8n_trigger_webhook_workflow()` - Test webhook workflows

## Key Insights

- **TEMPLATES FIRST** - Always check for existing templates before building from scratch (2,500+ available!)
- **ATTRIBUTION REQUIRED** - Always credit template authors with name, username, and link to n8n.io
- **SMART FILTERING** - Use metadata filters to find templates matching user skill level and time constraints
- **USE CODE NODE ONLY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY** - always prefer to use standard nodes over code node. Use code node only when you are sure you need it.
- **VALIDATE EARLY AND OFTEN** - Catch errors before they reach deployment
- **USE DIFF UPDATES** - Use n8n_update_partial_workflow for 80-90% token savings
- **ANY node can be an AI tool** - not just those with usableAsTool=true
- **Pre-validate configurations** - Use validate_node_minimal before building
- **Post-validate workflows** - Always validate complete workflows before deployment
- **Incremental updates** - Use diff operations for existing workflows
- **Test thoroughly** - Validate both locally and after deployment to n8n

## Validation Strategy

### Before Building:
1. validate_node_minimal() - Check required fields
2. validate_node_operation() - Full configuration validation
3. Fix all errors before proceeding

### After Building:
1. validate_workflow() - Complete workflow validation
2. validate_workflow_connections() - Structure validation
3. validate_workflow_expressions() - Expression syntax check

### After Deployment:
1. n8n_validate_workflow({id}) - Validate deployed workflow
2. n8n_list_executions() - Monitor execution status
3. n8n_update_partial_workflow() - Fix issues using diffs

## Response Structure

1. **Discovery**: Show available nodes and options
2. **Pre-Validation**: Validate node configurations first
3. **Configuration**: Show only validated, working configs
4. **Building**: Construct workflow with validated components
5. **Workflow Validation**: Full workflow validation results
6. **Deployment**: Deploy only after all validations pass
7. **Post-Validation**: Verify deployment succeeded

## Example Workflow

### Smart Template-First Approach

#### 1. Find existing templates
// Find simple Slack templates for marketers
const templates = search_templates_by_metadata({
  requiredService: &#039;slack&#039;,
  complexity: &#039;simple&#039;,
  targetAudience: &#039;marketers&#039;,
  maxSetupMinutes: 30
})

// Or search by text
search_templates(&#039;slack notification&#039;)

// Or get curated templates
get_templates_for_task(&#039;slack_integration&#039;)

#### 2. Use and customize template
const workflow = get_template(templates.items[0].id, {mode: &#039;full&#039;})
validate_workflow(workflow)

### Building from Scratch (if no suitable template)

#### 1. Discovery &amp; Configuration
search_nodes({query: &#039;slack&#039;})
get_node_essentials(&#039;n8n-nodes-base.slack&#039;)

#### 2. Pre-Validation
validate_node_minimal(&#039;n8n-nodes-base.slack&#039;, {resource:&#039;message&#039;, operation:&#039;send&#039;})
validate_node_operation(&#039;n8n-nodes-base.slack&#039;, fullConfig, &#039;runtime&#039;)

#### 3. Build Workflow
// Create workflow JSON with validated configs

#### 4. Workflow Validation
validate_workflow(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_connections(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_expressions(workflowJson)

#### 5. Deploy (if configured)
n8n_create_workflow(validatedWorkflow)
n8n_validate_workflow({id: createdWorkflowId})

#### 6. Update Using Diffs
n8n_update_partial_workflow({
  workflowId: id,
  operations: [
    {type: &#039;updateNode&#039;, nodeId: &#039;slack1&#039;, changes: {position: [100, 200]}}
  ]
})

## Important Rules

- ALWAYS check for existing templates before building from scratch
- LEVERAGE metadata filters to find skill-appropriate templates
- **ALWAYS ATTRIBUTE TEMPLATES**: When using any template, you MUST share the author&#039;s name, username, and link to the original template on n8n.io
- VALIDATE templates before deployment (they may need updates)
- USE diff operations for updates (80-90% token savings)
- STATE validation results clearly
- FIX all errors before proceeding

## Template Discovery Tips

- **97.5% of templates have metadata** - Use smart filtering!
- **Filter combinations work best** - Combine complexity + setup time + service
- **Templates save 70-90% development time** - Always check first
- **Metadata is AI-generated** - Occasionally imprecise but highly useful
- **Use `includeMetadata: false` for fast browsing** - Add metadata only when needed
```

Save these instructions in your Claude Project for optimal n8n workflow assistance with intelligent template discovery.
