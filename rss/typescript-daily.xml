## freeCodeCamp.org&#039;s open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) charity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you&#039;ve fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp&#039;s CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer&#039;s development environment.

Once you&#039;ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they&#039;ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people&#039;s code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our twelve core certifications:

# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge
of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We&#039;re using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That&#039;s where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.

## Stay Up-to-Date

Cal.com officially launched as v.1.0 on the 15th of September 2021 and we&#039;ve come a long way so far. Watch **releases** of this repository to be notified of future updates:

![cal-star-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/154853944-a9e3c999-3da3-4048-b149-b4f73893c6fb.gif)

&lt;!-- GETTING STARTED --&gt;

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.

- Node.js (Version: &gt;=18.x)
- PostgreSQL (Version: &gt;=13.x)
- Yarn _(recommended)_

&gt; If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you may want to obtain additional credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below under the [integrations section](#integrations).

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE). To clone in a private repository, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales)

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git
   ```

   &gt; If you are on Windows, run the following command on `gitbash` with admin privileges: &lt;br&gt; &gt; `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git` &lt;br&gt;
   &gt; See [docs](https://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windows#enable-symbolic-links) for more details.

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd cal.com
   ```

3. Install packages with yarn

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.

5. Setup Node
   If your Node version does not meet the project&#039;s requirements as instructed by the docs, &quot;nvm&quot; (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install &amp;&amp; nvm use
   ```

   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

#### Quick start with `yarn dx`

&gt; - **Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed**
&gt; - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console

```sh
yarn dx
```

#### Development tip
1. Add `export NODE_OPTIONS=“--max-old-space-size=16384”` to your shell script to increase the memory limit for the node process. Alternatively, you can run this in your terminal before running the app. Replace 16384 with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the node process.

2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` to your .env file to control the logging verbosity for all tRPC queries and mutations.\
   Where {level} can be one of the following:

   `0` for silly \
   `1` for trace \
   `2` for debug \
   `3` for info \
   `4` for warn \
   `5` for error \
   `6` for fatal

   When you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` in your .env file, it enables logging at that level and higher. Here&#039;s how it works:

   The logger will include all logs that are at the specified level or higher. For example: \

   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=2`, it will log from level 2 (debug) upwards, meaning levels 2 (debug), 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and (fatal) will be logged. \
   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3`, it will log from level 3 (info) upwards, meaning levels 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged, but level 2 (debug) and level 1 (trace) will be ignored. \

```sh
echo &#039;NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3&#039; &gt;&gt; .env
```

for Logger level to be set at info, for example.

#### Gitpod Setup

1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.

2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)

#### Manual setup

1. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Replace `&lt;user&gt;`, `&lt;pass&gt;`, `&lt;db-host&gt;`, and `&lt;db-port&gt;` with their applicable values

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=&#039;postgresql://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@&lt;db-host&gt;:&lt;db-port&gt;&#039;
   ```

   &lt;details&gt;
   &lt;summary&gt;If you don&#039;t know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB&lt;/summary&gt;

   1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install postgres in your local (if you don&#039;t have it already).

   2. Create your own local db by executing `createDB &lt;DB name&gt;`

   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d &lt;DB name&gt;`

   4. Inside the psql shell execute `\conninfo`. And you will get the following info.  
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png)

   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this
      `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name`. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.

   &lt;/details&gt;

   If you don&#039;t want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app or render.

   - [Setup postgres DB with railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql)
   - [Setup postgres DB with render](https://render.com/docs/databases)

1. Copy and paste your `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` to `.env.appStore`.

1. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Run [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to view emails sent during development

   &gt; **_NOTE:_** Required when `E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED` is &quot;1&quot;

   ```sh
   docker pull mailhog/mailhog
   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
   ```

1. Run (in development mode)

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

#### Setting up your first user

##### Approach 1

1. Open [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:

   ```sh
   yarn db-studio
   ```

1. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
1. Fill out the fields `email`, `username`, `password`, and set `metadata` to empty `{}` (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
   &gt; New users are set on a `TRIAL` plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` file.
1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.

##### Approach 2

Seed the local db by running

```sh
cd packages/prisma
yarn db-seed
```

The above command will populate the local db with dummy users.

### E2E-Testing

Be sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
# In a terminal just run:
yarn test-e2e

# To open the last HTML report run:
yarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report
```

#### Resolving issues

##### E2E test browsers not installed

Run `npx playwright install` to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running `yarn test-e2e`:

```
Executable doesn&#039;t exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

### Upgrading from earlier versions

1. Pull the current version:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

1. Apply database migrations by running &lt;b&gt;one of&lt;/b&gt; the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate
   ```

   (This can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy
   ```

1. Check for `.env` variables changes

   ```sh
   yarn predev
   ```

1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   For a production build, run for example:

   ```sh
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

1. Enjoy the new version.

## changed-files

Effortlessly track all changed files and directories relative to a target branch, the current branch (preceding commit or the last remote commit), multiple branches, or custom commits returning **relative paths** from the project root using this GitHub action.

&gt; \[!WARNING]\
&gt; **Security Alert:** A critical security issue was identified in this action due to a compromised commit: [0e58ed8671d6b60d0890c21b07f8835ace038e67](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/commit/0e58ed8671d6b60d0890c21b07f8835ace038e67).
&gt;
&gt; This commit has been **removed** from all tags and branches, and necessary measures have been implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.
&gt;
&gt; #### **Action Required:**
&gt;
&gt; *   **Review your workflows executed between March 14 and March 15.** If you notice unexpected output under the `changed-files` section, decode  it using the following command:  `echo &#039;xxx&#039; | base64 -d | base64 -d`\
&gt;     If the output contains sensitive information (e.g., tokens or secrets), **revoke and rotate those secrets immediately**.
&gt; *   **If your workflows reference this commit directly by its SHA**, you must update them immediately to avoid using the compromised version.
&gt; *   **If you are using tagged versions** (e.g., `v35`, `v44.5.1`), no action is required as these tags have been updated and are now safe to use.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, as a precaution, we recommend rotating any secrets that may have been exposed during this timeframe to ensure the continued security of your workflows.

&gt; \[!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; *   This action solely identifies files that have changed for events such as [`pull_request*`, `push`, `merge_group`, `release`, and many more](#other-supported-events-electron). However, it doesn&#039;t detect pending uncommitted changes created during the workflow execution.
&gt;
&gt;     See: https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files instead.

## Features 🚀

*   Fast execution, averaging 0-10 seconds.
*   Leverages either [Github&#039;s REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-commits) or [Git&#039;s native diff command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) to determine changed files.
*   Facilitates easy debugging.
*   Scales to handle large/mono repositories.
*   Supports Git submodules.
*   Supports [merge queues](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue) for pull requests.
*   Generates escaped [JSON output for running matrix jobs](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/main/.github/workflows/matrix-example.yml) based on changed files.
*   Lists changed directories.
    *   Limits matching changed directories to a specified maximum depth.
    *   Optionally excludes the current directory.
*   Writes outputs to a designated `.txt` or `.json` file for further processing.
*   Restores deleted files to their previous location or a newly specified location.
*   Supports fetching a fixed number of commits, which improves performance.
*   Compatible with all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows).
*   Supports [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).
*   Supports [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.3/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server).
*   Supports [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
*   Lists all files and directories that have changed:
    *   Between the current pull request branch and the last commit on the target branch.
    *   Between the last commit and the current pushed change.
    *   Between the last remote branch commit and the current HEAD.
*   Restricts change detection to a subset of files and directories:
    *   Provides boolean output indicating changes in specific files.
    *   Uses [Glob pattern](https://codepen.io/mrmlnc/pen/OXQjMe) matching.
        *   Supports Globstar.
        *   Supports brace expansion.
        *   Supports negation.
    *   Uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) syntax for specifying patterns.
        *   Supports [YAML anchors &amp; aliases](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/main/test/changed-files.yml#L8-L12).
        *   Supports [YAML multi-line strings](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/main/test/changed-files.yml#L13-L16).

And many more...

## Usage 💻

&gt; \[!IMPORTANT]
&gt;
&gt; *   **Push Events**: When configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage), make sure to set [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) to either `0` or `2`, depending on your use case.
&gt; *   **Mono Repositories**: To avoid pulling the entire branch history, you can utilize the default [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage)&#039;s [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) of `1` for [`pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) events.
&gt; *   **Quoting Multiline Inputs**: Avoid using single or double quotes for [multiline](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/main/test/changed-files.yml#L13-L16) inputs. The value is already a string separated by a newline character. Refer to the [Examples](#examples-) section for more information.
&gt; *   **Credentials Persistence**: If [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) is not set to 0, make sure to set [`persist-credentials`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage)  to `true` when configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage).
&gt; *   **Matching Files and Folders**: To match all files and folders under a directory, this requires a globstar pattern e.g. `dir_name/**` which matches any number of subdirectories and files.

## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&amp;nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&amp;nbsp;Real-time collaboration.

&lt;h1&gt;Lost City - May 18, 2004&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Learn about our history and ethos on our forum: https://lostcity.rs/t/faq-what-is-lost-city/16

## Getting Started

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; If you run into issues please see our [common issues](#common-issues).

1. Download and extract this repo somewhere on your computer
2. Install our [dependencies](#environment-dependencies)
3. Open the folder you downloaded: **Run the quickstart script and follow the on-screen prompts.** You may disregard any severity warnings you see

Once your setup process has completed, wait for it to tell you the world has started before trying to play.

The server includes its own webclient, so you don&#039;t have to download a client!

## Dependencies

- [NodeJS 22](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/) - later LTS versions are also fine.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you&#039;re using VS Code (recommended), [we have an extension to install on the marketplace.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2004scape.runescriptlanguage)

## Workflow

Content developers should run `npm start`. The server will watch for changes to scripts and configs, then automatically repack everything.

Engine developers should run `npm run dev`. This does what `npm start` does above, but also completely restarts the server when engine code has changed.

## Common Issues

* `bad option: --import`  
You are using an older version of Node. Reinstall and re-run.

* `&#039;&quot;java&quot;&#039; is not recognized as an internal or external command`  
You do not have Java installed.

* `has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0`  
You are using Java 8 or Java 11. If you have multiple java versions, you are now an &quot;advanced user,&quot; go ahead and set `JAVA_PATH=path-to-java.exe` in your .env file.

# Features

## ⚒️ Support Tools via MCP Servers
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

With tools, you can access the file system, obtain system information, interact with databases, access remote data, and more, rather than just having a simple conversation.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aa98f2b-c26d-435e-8196-73fa414066eb

We have created an open [marketplace for MCP Servers](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/mcpsvr). it empowers users to discover exceptional tools while offering a streamlined process for sharing their own MCP server creations.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be66c30e-bb29-4dfe-9f25-8d396470ed60

## 💡 Local Knowledge Base
We have integrated the bge-m3 as our local embedding model, which excels in multilingual vectorization. 5ire now supports parsing and vectorization of docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf, txt, and csv documents, enabling storage of these vectors to power robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities locally.

![Local Knowledge Base Screenshot](https://5ire.app/knowledge.png)

## 📈 Usage Analytics
By keeping track of your API usage and spending, you can gain a better understanding of how much you&#039;re spending on the API and make informed decisions to optimize your use of the service.

![Usage Analytics Screenshot](https://5ire.app/analytics.png)

## ✨ Prompts Library
The prompt library provides an effective way to create and organize your own prompts. These prompts are highly versatile, thanks to their support for variables.

![Prompts Library Screenshot](https://5ire.app/prompts.png)

## 🔖 Bookmarks
You can bookmark each conversation, and even if the original messages are deleted, the saved bookmarked content remains unaffected.
![Bookmarks Screenshot](https://5ire.app/bookmarks.png)

## 🔍 Quick Search
You can perform keyword searches across all conversations, quickly pinpointing the information you need.
![Search Screenshot](https://5ire.app/search.png)


&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Since 5ire uses native dependencies, it needs to be packaged on the corresponding platform. If it is on Mac OS, you may also need to configure APPLE_TEAM_ID, APPLE_ID, and APPLE_ID_PASS for notarization to avoid security alerts.


&lt;hr/&gt;

##  Discover Exceptional MCP Servers

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; [MCPSvr](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/mcpsvr), a community-driven directory of MCP servers, empowers developers to discover exceptional tools while offering a streamlined process for sharing their own MCP server creations.

## Features


### Application Performance Monitoring

Use SigNoz APM to monitor your applications and services. It comes with out-of-box charts for key application metrics like p99 latency, error rate, Apdex and operations per second. You can also monitor the database and external calls made from your application. Read [more](https://signoz.io/application-performance-monitoring/).

You can [instrument](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) your application with OpenTelemetry to get started.

![apm-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa5c0396-0854-4c8b-b972-9b62fd2a70d2)


### Logs Management

SigNoz can be used as a centralized log management solution. We use ClickHouse (used by likes of Uber &amp; Cloudflare) as a datastore, ⎯ an extremely fast and highly optimized storage for logs data. Instantly search through all your logs using quick filters and a powerful query builder.

You can also create charts on your logs and monitor them with customized dashboards. Read [more](https://signoz.io/log-management/).

![logs-management-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343588ee-98fb-4310-b3d2-c5bacf9c7384)


### Distributed Tracing

Distributed Tracing is essential to troubleshoot issues in microservices applications. Powered by OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing in SigNoz can help you track user requests across services to help you identify performance bottlenecks. 

See user requests in a detailed breakdown with the help of Flamegraphs and Gantt Charts. Click on any span to see the entire trace represented beautifully, which will help you make sense of where issues actually occurred in the flow of requests.

Read [more](https://signoz.io/distributed-tracing/).

![distributed-tracing-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfe060a-0c40-4922-9b55-8a97e1a4076c)



### Metrics and Dashboards

Ingest metrics from your infrastructure or applications and create customized dashboards to monitor them. Create visualization that suits your needs with a variety of panel types like pie chart, time-series, bar chart, etc.

Create queries on your metrics data quickly with an easy-to-use metrics query builder. Add multiple queries and combine those queries with formulae to create really complex queries quickly.

![metrics-n-dashboards-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a536fd71-1d2c-4681-aa7e-516d754c47a5)

### Alerts

Use alerts in SigNoz to get notified when anything unusual happens in your application. You can set alerts on any type of telemetry signal (logs, metrics, traces), create thresholds and set up a notification channel to get notified. Advanced features like alert history and anomaly detection can help you create smarter alerts.

Alerts in SigNoz help you identify issues proactively so that you can address them before they reach your customers.

![alerts-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03873bb8-1b62-4adf-8f56-28bb7b1750ea)

### Exceptions Monitoring

Monitor exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript. For other languages, just drop in a few lines of code and start monitoring exceptions.

See the detailed stack trace for all exceptions caught in your application. You can also log in custom attributes to add more context to your exceptions. For example, you can add attributes to identify users for which exceptions occurred.

## Comparisons to Familiar Tools

### SigNoz vs Prometheus

Prometheus is good if you want to do just metrics. But if you want to have a seamless experience between metrics, logs and traces, then current experience of stitching together Prometheus &amp; other tools is not great.

SigNoz is a one-stop solution for metrics and other telemetry signals. And because you will use the same standard(OpenTelemetry) to collect all telemetry signals, you can also correlate these signals to troubleshoot quickly.

For example, if you see that there are issues with infrastructure metrics of your k8s cluster at a timestamp, you can jump to other signals like logs and traces to understand the issue quickly.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp  &lt;/p&gt;

### SigNoz vs Jaeger

Jaeger only does distributed tracing. SigNoz supports metrics, traces and logs - all the 3 pillars of observability.

Moreover, SigNoz has few more advanced features wrt Jaeger:

- Jaegar UI doesn’t show any metrics on traces or on filtered traces
- Jaeger can’t get aggregates on filtered traces. For example, p99 latency of requests which have tag - customer_type=&#039;premium&#039;. This can be done easily on SigNoz
- You can also go from traces to logs easily in SigNoz

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp  &lt;/p&gt;

### SigNoz vs Elastic 

- SigNoz Logs management are based on ClickHouse, a columnar OLAP datastore which makes aggregate log analytics queries much more efficient
- 50% lower resource requirement compared to Elastic during ingestion

We have published benchmarks comparing Elastic with SigNoz. Check it out [here](https://signoz.io/blog/logs-performance-benchmark/?utm_source=github-readme&amp;utm_medium=logs-benchmark)

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp  &lt;/p&gt;

### SigNoz vs Loki

- SigNoz supports aggregations on high-cardinality data over a huge volume while loki doesn’t.
- SigNoz supports indexes over high cardinality data and has no limitations on the number of indexes, while Loki reaches max streams with a few indexes added to it.
- Searching over a huge volume of data is difficult and slow in Loki compared to SigNoz

We have published benchmarks comparing Loki with SigNoz. Check it out [here](https://signoz.io/blog/logs-performance-benchmark/?utm_source=github-readme&amp;utm_medium=logs-benchmark)

## Intro

This boilerplate helps you create Chrome/Firefox extensions using React and Typescript. It improves
the build speed and development experience by using Vite and Turborepo.

## Features

- [React19](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Chrome Extensions Manifest Version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
- [Custom i18n package](/packages/i18n/)
- [Custom HMR (Hot Module Rebuild) plugin](/packages/hmr/)
- [End-to-end testing with WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)

## Getting started

1. When you&#039;re using Windows run this:
    - `git config --global core.eol lf`
    - `git config --global core.autocrlf input`

   **This will set the EOL (End of line) character to be the same as on Linux/macOS. Without this, our bash script won&#039;t
   work, and you will have conflicts with developers on Linux/macOS.**
2. Clone this repository.( ```git clone https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite``` )
3. Ensure your node version is &gt;= than in `.nvmrc` file, recommend to
   use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#intro)
4. Edit `/packages/i18n/locales/`{your locale(s)}/`messages.json`
5. In the objects `extensionDescription` and `extensionName`, change the `message` fields (leave `description` alone)
6. In `/.package.json`, change the `version` to the desired version of your extension.
7. Install pnpm globally: `npm install -g pnpm` (ensure your node version &gt;= 22.12.0)
8. Run `pnpm install`

Then, depending on the target browser:

### For Chrome: &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started-chrome&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev` (on Windows, you should run as administrator;
      see [issue#456](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/456))
    - Prod: `pnpm build`
2. Open in browser - `chrome://extensions`
3. Check - &lt;kbd&gt;Developer mode&lt;/kbd&gt;
4. Click - &lt;kbd&gt;Load unpacked&lt;/kbd&gt; in the upper left corner
5. Select the `dist` directory from the boilerplate project

### For Firefox: &lt;a name=&quot;getting-started-firefox&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run:
    - Dev: `pnpm dev:firefox`
    - Prod: `pnpm build:firefox`
2. Open in browser - `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click - &lt;kbd&gt;Load Temporary Add-on...&lt;/kbd&gt; in the upper right corner
4. Select the `./dist/manifest.json` file from the boilerplate project

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; In Firefox, you load add-ons in temporary mode. That means they&#039;ll disappear after each browser close. You have to
&gt; load the add-on on every browser launch.

## Install dependency for turborepo: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### For root: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency-for-root&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run `pnpm i &lt;package&gt; -w`

### For module: &lt;a name=&quot;install-dependency-for-module&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

1. Run `pnpm i &lt;package&gt; -F &lt;module name&gt;`

`package` - Name of the package you want to install e.g. `nodemon` \
`module-name` - You can find it inside each `package.json` under the key `name`, e.g. `@extension/content-script`, you
can use only `content-script` without `@extension/` prefix

## How do I disable modules I&#039;m not using?

```bash
$ pnpm module-manager
```

Read: [Module Manager](packages/module-manager/README.md)

## Environment variables

Read: [Env Documentation](packages/env/README.md)

## Boilerplate structure &lt;a name=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Chrome extension &lt;a name=&quot;structure-chrome-extension&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The extension lives in the `chrome-extension` directory and includes the following files:

- [`manifest.ts`](chrome-extension/manifest.ts) - script that outputs the `manifest.json`
- [`src/background`](chrome-extension/src/background) - [background script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/background_pages/)
  (`background.service_worker` in manifest.json)
- [`public`](chrome-extension/public/) - icons referenced in the manifest; content CSS for user&#039;s page injection

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; To facilitate development, the boilerplate is configured to &quot;Read and change all your data on all websites&quot;.
&gt; In production, it&#039;s best practice to limit the premissions to only the strictly necessary websites. See
&gt; [Declaring permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions)
&gt; and edit `manifest.js` accordingly.

### Pages &lt;a name=&quot;structure-pages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Code that is transpiled to be part of the extension lives in the [pages](pages/) directory.

- [
  `content`](pages/content/) - [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts)
  (`content_scripts` in manifest.json)
- [`content-ui`](pages/content-ui) - React UI rendered in the current page (you can see it at the very bottom when you
  get started)
  (`content_scripts` in manifest.json)
- [
  `content-runtime`](pages/content-runtime/src/) - [injected content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality);
  this can be injected from `popup` like standard `content`
- [
  `devtools`](pages/devtools/) - [extend the browser DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools#creating)
  (`devtools_page` in manifest.json)
- [
  `devtools-panel`](pages/devtools-panel/) - [DevTools panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/panels)
  for [devtools](pages/devtools/src/index.ts)
- [
  `new-tab`](pages/new-tab/) - [override the default New Tab page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/override-chrome-pages)
  (`chrome_url_overrides.newtab` in manifest.json)
- [`options`](pages/options/) - [options page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page)
  (`options_page` in manifest.json)
- [`popup`](pages/popup/) - [popup](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/action#popup) shown when
  clicking the extension in the toolbar
  (`action.default_popup` in manifest.json)
- [
  `side-panel`](pages/side-panel/) - [sidepanel (Chrome 114+)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel)
  (`side_panel.default_path` in manifest.json)

### Packages &lt;a name=&quot;structure-packages&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Some shared packages:

- `dev-utils` - utilities for Chrome extension development (manifest-parser, logger)
- `env` - exports object which contain all environment variables from `.env` and dynamically declared
- `hmr` - custom HMR plugin for Vite, injection script for reload/refresh, HMR dev-server
- `i18n` - custom internationalization package; provides i18n function with type safety and other validation
- `shared` - shared code for the entire project (types, constants, custom hooks, components etc.)
- `storage` - helpers for easier integration with [storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage), e.g. local/session storages
- `tailwind-config` - shared Tailwind config for entire project
- `tsconfig` - shared tsconfig for the entire project
- `ui` - function to merge your Tailwind config with the global one; you can save components here
- `vite-config` - shared Vite config for the entire project

Other useful packages:

- `zipper` - run `pnpm zip` to pack the `dist` folder into `extension-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.zip` inside the newly created
  `dist-zip`
- `module-manager` - run `pnpm module-manager` to enable/disable modules
- `e2e` - run `pnpm e2e` for end-to-end tests of your zipped extension on different browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Hot module reload seems to have frozen

If saving source files doesn&#039;t cause the extension HMR code to trigger a reload of the browser page, try this:

1. Ctrl+C the development server and restart it (`pnpm run dev`)
2. If you get a [`grpc` error](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/612),
   [kill the
   `turbo` process](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite/issues/612#issuecomment-2518982339)
   and run `pnpm dev` again.

- [Expo Development Environment Setup](./docs/readme/expo-environment.md)
- [Native Development Environment Setup](./docs/readme/environment.md)
- [Build Troubleshooting](./docs/readme/troubleshooting.md)
- [Testing](./docs/readme/testing.md)
- [Debugging](./docs/readme/debugging.md)
- [Storybook](./docs/readme/storybook.md)
- [Miscellaneous](./docs/readme/miscellaneous.md)

## Getting started

### Using Expo (recommended)

Expo is the fastest way to start developing. With the Expo framework, developers don&#039;t need to compile the native side of the application as before, hence no need for any native enviornment setup, developers only need to download a precompiled develpoment build and run the javascript bundler. The development build will then connect with the bundler to load the javascript code.

#### Expo Environment Setup

[Install node, yarn and watchman.](./docs/readme/expo-environment.md)

#### Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MetaMask/metamask-mobile.git &amp;&amp; \
cd metamask-mobile
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn setup:expo
```

#### Run the bundler

```bash
yarn watch
```

#### Download and install the development build

#### For internal developers
- Access Runway via Okta and go to the Expo bucket either on the iOS or Android section. From there you will see the available development builds (android-expo-dev-build.apk or ios-expo-dev-build.ipa).
- For Android:
  - Install the .apk on your Android device or simulator.
- For iOS:
  - Device: you need to have your iPhone registered with our Apple dev account. If you have it, you can install the .ipa on your device.
  - Simulator: please follow the [native development section](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile?tab=readme-ov-file#native-development) and run `yarn setup` and `yarn start:ios` as the .ipa will not work for now, we are working on having an .app that works on simulators.

##### [SOON] For external developers (we are testing the new dev builds and will make them publicly available soon after)

#### Load the app

If on a simulator:
- use the initial expo screen that appears when starting the development to choose the bundler url
- OR press &quot;a&quot; for Android or &quot;i&quot; for iOS on the terminal where the bundler is running

If on a physical device:
- Use the camera app to scan the QR code presented by the bundler running on the terminal

That&#039;s it! This will work for any javascript development, if you need to develop or modify native code please see the next section.

### Native Development

If developing or modifying native code or installing any library that introduces or uses native code, it is not possible to use an Expo precompiled development build as you need to compile the native side of the application again. To do so, please follow the steps stated in this section.

#### Native Environment setup

Before running the app for native development, make sure your development environment has all the required tools. Several of these tools (ie Node and Ruby) may require specific versions in order to successfully build the app.

[Setup your development environment](./docs/readme/environment.md)

#### Building the app

**Clone the project**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MetaMask/metamask-mobile.git &amp;&amp; \
cd metamask-mobile
```

##### Firebase Messaging Setup

MetaMask uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to enable app communications. To integrate FCM, you’ll need configuration files for both iOS and Android platforms.

###### Internal Contributor instructions

1. Grab the `.js.env` file from 1Password, ask around for the correct vault. This file contains the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID` and `GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS` secrets that will be used to generate the relevant configuration files for IOS/Android.
2. [Install](./README.md#install-dependencies) and [run &amp; start](./README.md#running-the-app) the application as documented below.

###### External Contributor instructions

As an external contributor, you need to provide your own Firebase project configuration files:
- **`GoogleService-Info.plist`** (iOS)
- **`google-services.json`** (Android)

1.	Create a Free Firebase Project
    - Set up a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    - Configure the project with a client package name matching `io.metamask` (IMPORTANT). 
2.	Add Configuration Files
    - Create/Update the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files in:
    - `android/app/google-services.json` (for Android)
    - `ios/GoogleServices/GoogleService-Info.plist` directory (for iOS)
3. Create the correct base64 environments variables.
  
```bash
# Generate Android Base64 Version of Google Services
export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID=&quot;$(base64 -w0 -i ./android/app/google-services.json)&quot; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID=\&quot;$GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_ANDROID\&quot;&quot; | tee -a .js.env

# Generate IOS Base64 Version of Google Services
export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS=&quot;$(base64 -w0 -i ./ios/GoogleServices/GoogleService-Info.plist)&quot; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;export GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS=\&quot;$GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64_IOS\&quot;&quot; | tee -a .js.env
```

[!CAUTION]
&gt; In case you don&#039;t provide your own Firebase project config file or run the steps above, you will face the error `No matching client found for package name &#039;io.metamask&#039;`.

In case of any doubt, please follow the instructions in the link below to get your Firebase project config file.
[Firebase Project Quickstart](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/quickstart-js/messaging/readme/#getting_started)

##### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn setup
```

_Not the usual install command, this will run scripts and a lengthy postinstall flow_

#### Running the app for native development

**Run Metro bundler**

```bash
yarn watch
```

_Like a local server for the app_

**Run on a iOS device**

```bash
yarn start:ios
```

**Run on an Android device**

```bash
yarn start:android
```

# Frigate - NVR With Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras

A complete and local NVR designed for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a [Google Coral Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/) is optional, but highly recommended. The Coral will outperform even the best CPUs and can process 100+ FPS with very little overhead.

- Tight integration with Home Assistant via a [custom component](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate-hass-integration)
- Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
- Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
- Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
- Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
- Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
- Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
- 24/7 recording
- Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
- WebRTC &amp; MSE support for low-latency live view
