## 🎯 What is Shannon?

Shannon is an AI pentester that delivers actual exploits, not just alerts.

Shannon&#039;s goal is to break your web app before someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.

**What Problem Does Shannon Solve?**

Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a *massive* security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.

Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester. It doesn&#039;t just find potential issues. It executes real exploits, providing concrete proof of vulnerabilities. This lets you ship with confidence, knowing every build can be secured.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **From Autonomous Pentesting to Automated Compliance**
&gt;
&gt; Shannon is a core component of the **Keygraph Security and Compliance Platform**.
&gt;
&gt; While Shannon automates the critical task of penetration testing for your application, our broader platform automates your entire compliance journey—from evidence collection to audit readiness. We&#039;re building the &quot;Rippling for Cybersecurity,&quot; a single platform to manage your security posture and streamline compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and HIPAA.

## 🚀 Setup &amp; Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **AI Provider Credentials** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API key** (recommended) - Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
  - **Claude Code OAuth token**
  - **[EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Alternative providers via Router Mode** - OpenAI or Google Gemini via OpenRouter (see [Router Mode](#experimental---unsupported-router-mode-alternative-providers))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone Shannon
git clone https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon.git
cd shannon

# 2. Configure credentials (choose one method)

# Option A: Export environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;              # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000           # recommended

# Option B: Create a .env file
cat &gt; .env &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
EOF

# 3. Run a pentest
./shannon start URL=https://your-app.com REPO=your-repo
```

Shannon will build the containers, start the workflow, and return a workflow ID. The pentest runs in the background.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# View real-time worker logs
./shannon logs

# Query a specific workflow&#039;s progress
./shannon query ID=shannon-1234567890

# Open the Temporal Web UI for detailed monitoring
open http://localhost:8233
```

### Stopping Shannon

```bash
# Stop all containers (preserves workflow data)
./shannon stop

# Full cleanup (removes all data)
./shannon stop CLEAN=true
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic pentest
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name

# With a configuration file
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name CONFIG=./configs/my-config.yaml

# Custom output directory
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name OUTPUT=./my-reports
```

### Prepare Your Repository

Shannon expects target repositories to be placed under the `./repos/` directory at the project root. The `REPO` flag refers to a folder name inside `./repos/`. Copy the repository you want to scan into `./repos/`, or clone it directly there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git ./repos/your-repo
```

**For monorepos:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-monorepo.git ./repos/your-monorepo
```

**For multi-repository applications** (e.g., separate frontend/backend):

```bash
mkdir ./repos/your-app
cd ./repos/your-app
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/api.git
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Linux (Native Docker):**

You may need to run commands with `sudo` depending on your Docker setup. If you encounter permission issues with output files, ensure your user has access to the Docker socket.

**For macOS:**

Works out of the box with Docker Desktop installed.

**Testing Local Applications:**

Docker containers cannot reach `localhost` on your host machine. Use `host.docker.internal` in place of `localhost`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 REPO=repo-name
```

### Configuration (Optional)

While you can run without a config file, creating one enables authenticated testing and customized analysis. Place your configuration files inside the `./configs/` directory — this folder is mounted into the Docker container automatically.

#### Create Configuration File

Copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
cp configs/example-config.yaml configs/my-app-config.yaml
```

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
authentication:
  login_type: form
  login_url: &quot;https://your-app.com/login&quot;
  credentials:
    username: &quot;test@example.com&quot;
    password: &quot;yourpassword&quot;
    totp_secret: &quot;LB2E2RX7XFHSTGCK&quot;  # Optional for 2FA

  login_flow:
    - &quot;Type $username into the email field&quot;
    - &quot;Type $password into the password field&quot;
    - &quot;Click the &#039;Sign In&#039; button&quot;

  success_condition:
    type: url_contains
    value: &quot;/dashboard&quot;

rules:
  avoid:
    - description: &quot;AI should avoid testing logout functionality&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/logout&quot;

  focus:
    - description: &quot;AI should emphasize testing API endpoints&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/api&quot;
```

#### TOTP Setup for 2FA

If your application uses two-factor authentication, simply add the TOTP secret to your config file. The AI will automatically generate the required codes during testing.

### [EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Router Mode (Alternative Providers)

Shannon can experimentally route requests through alternative AI providers using claude-code-router. This mode is not officially supported and is intended primarily for:

* **Model experimentation** — try Shannon with GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3–family models

#### Quick Setup

1. Add your provider API key to `.env`:

```bash
# Choose one provider:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Set default model:
ROUTER_DEFAULT=openai,gpt-5.2  # provider,model format
```

2. Run with `ROUTER=true`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name ROUTER=true
```

#### Experimental Models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-5.2, gpt-5-mini |
| OpenRouter | google/gemini-3-flash-preview |

#### Disclaimer

This feature is experimental and unsupported. Output quality depends heavily on the model. Shannon is built on top of the Anthropic Agent SDK and is optimized and primarily tested with Anthropic Claude models. Alternative providers may produce inconsistent results (including failing early phases like Recon) depending on the model and routing setup.

### Output and Results

All results are saved to `./audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/` by default. Use `--output &lt;path&gt;` to specify a custom directory.

Output structure:
```
audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/
├── session.json          # Metrics and session data
├── agents/               # Per-agent execution logs
├── prompts/              # Prompt snapshots for reproducibility
└── deliverables/
    └── comprehensive_security_assessment_report.md   # Final comprehensive security report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shannon emulates a human penetration tester&#039;s methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. It combines white-box source code analysis with black-box dynamic exploitation across four distinct phases:

### Architectural Overview

Shannon is engineered to emulate the methodology of a human penetration tester. It leverages Anthropic&#039;s Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of **white-box source code analysis** with the real-world validation of **black-box dynamic exploitation**, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.

---

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application&#039;s attack surface. Shannon analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.

#### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of **hypothesized exploitable paths** that are passed on for validation.

#### **Phase 3: Exploitation**

Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict **&quot;No Exploit, No Report&quot;** policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.

#### **Phase 4: Reporting**

The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with **reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts**, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.

## 🚀 How to Run

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
bun start
```

Or with watch mode for development:
```bash
bun dev
```

## 📊 How to Evaluate

Dexter includes an evaluation suite that tests the agent against a dataset of financial questions. Evals use LangSmith for tracking and an LLM-as-judge approach for scoring correctness.

**Run on all questions:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts
```

**Run on a random sample of data:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts --sample 10
```

The eval runner displays a real-time UI showing progress, current question, and running accuracy statistics. Results are logged to LangSmith for analysis.

## 🐛 How to Debug

Dexter logs all tool calls to a scratchpad file for debugging and history tracking. Each query creates a new JSONL file in `.dexter/scratchpad/`.

**Scratchpad location:**
```
.dexter/scratchpad/
├── 2026-01-30-111400_9a8f10723f79.jsonl
├── 2026-01-30-143022_a1b2c3d4e5f6.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each file contains newline-delimited JSON entries tracking:
- **init**: The original query
- **tool_result**: Each tool call with arguments, raw result, and LLM summary
- **thinking**: Agent reasoning steps

**Example scratchpad entry:**
```json
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;tool_result&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:&quot;2026-01-30T11:14:05.123Z&quot;,&quot;toolName&quot;:&quot;get_income_statements&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:{&quot;ticker&quot;:&quot;AAPL&quot;,&quot;period&quot;:&quot;annual&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:5},&quot;result&quot;:{...},&quot;llmSummary&quot;:&quot;Retrieved 5 years of Apple annual income statements showing revenue growth from $274B to $394B&quot;}
```

This makes it easy to inspect exactly what data the agent gathered and how it interpreted results.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@every-env/compound-plugin)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@every-env/compound-plugin)

A Claude Code plugin marketplace featuring the **Compound Engineering Plugin** — tools that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Claude Code Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
/plugin install compound-engineering
```

## OpenCode + Codex (experimental) Install

This repo includes a Bun/TypeScript CLI that converts Claude Code plugins to OpenCode and Codex.

```bash
# convert the compound-engineering plugin into OpenCode format
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to opencode

# convert to Codex format
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to codex
```

Local dev:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts install ./plugins/compound-engineering --to opencode
```

OpenCode output is written to `~/.config/opencode` by default, with `opencode.json` at the root and `agents/`, `skills/`, and `plugins/` alongside it.
Both provider targets are experimental and may change as the formats evolve.
Codex output is written to `~/.codex/prompts` and `~/.codex/skills`, with each Claude command converted into both a prompt and a skill (the prompt instructs Codex to load the corresponding skill). Generated Codex skill descriptions are truncated to 1024 characters (Codex limit).

## Sync Personal Config

Sync your personal Claude Code config (`~/.claude/`) to OpenCode or Codex:

```bash
# Sync skills and MCP servers to OpenCode
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target opencode

# Sync to Codex
bunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target codex
```

This syncs:
- Personal skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (as symlinks)
- MCP servers from `~/.claude/settings.json`

Skills are symlinked (not copied) so changes in Claude Code are reflected immediately.

## Workflow

```
Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/workflows:plan` | Turn feature ideas into detailed implementation plans |
| `/workflows:work` | Execute plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review before merging |
| `/workflows:compound` | Document learnings to make future work easier |

Each cycle compounds: plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented.

## Philosophy

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder.**

Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. The codebase becomes harder to work with over time.

Compound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:
- Plan thoroughly before writing code
- Review to catch issues and capture learnings
- Codify knowledge so it&#039;s reusable
- Keep quality high so future changes are easy

## Contributing

We love our contributors! Here&#039;s how you can contribute:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues) if you believe you&#039;ve encountered a bug.
- Follow the [local development guide](https://dub.co/docs/local-development) to get your local dev environment set up.
- Make a [pull request](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/pull) to add new features/make quality-of-life improvements/fix bugs.

### Recommended Versions

| Package | Version  |
| ------- | -------- |
| node    | v23.11.0 |
| pnpm    | 9.15.9   |

### Common Local Development Issues

- `The table &lt;table-name&gt; does not exist in the current database.` - Run `pnpm prisma:push` push the state of the Prisma schema file to the database without using migrations files.
- The project is not building correctly locally - verify your versions of `node` and `pnpm` match the recommended versions above. Delete all `node_modules`, `.next`, and `.turbo` directories in the `apps` and `packages` directory. You may now reinstall `node_modules` by running `pnpm install` and attempt to rebuild the project with `pnpm build`.

### Dev Seed Script

This script seeds the database with development data for testing and development purposes.

**Basic seeding (adds data without deleting existing data):**

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm run script dev/seed
```

**Truncate database before seeding (deletes all existing data first):**

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm run script dev/seed --truncate
```

When using `--truncate`, the script will ask for confirmation before deleting any data.

## License

Dub Technologies, Inc. is a commercial open-source company, which means some parts of this open-source repository require a commercial license. The concept is called &quot;Open Core&quot; where the core technology (99%) is fully open source, licensed under [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and the last 1% is covered under a commercial license ([&quot;/ee&quot; Enterprise Edition](&lt;https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/ee/apps/web/app/(ee)&gt;)) which we believe is entirely relevant for larger organisations that require enterprise features. Enterprise features are built by the core engineering team of Dub Technologies, Inc., which is hired full-time.

Sonixd is a cross-platform desktop client built for Subsonic-API (and Jellyfin in 0.8.0+) compatible music servers. This project was inspired by the many existing clients, but aimed to address a few key issues including &lt;strong&gt;scalability&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;library management&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;user experience&lt;/strong&gt;.

- [**Usage documentation &amp; FAQ**](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/15)
- [**Theming documentation**](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/61)

Sonixd has been tested on the following: [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome), [Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic), [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced), [Gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic), [Astiga](https://asti.ga/), [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)

### [Demo Sonixd using Navidrome](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/244)

## Features

- HTML5 audio with crossfading and gapless\* playback
- Drag and drop rows with multi-select
- Modify and save playlists intuitively
- Handles large playlists and queues
- Global mediakeys (and partial MPRIS) support
- Multi-theme support
- Supports all Subsonic/Jellyfin API compatible servers
- Built with Electron, React with the [rsuite v4](https://github.com/rsuite/rsuite) component library

&lt;h5&gt;* Gapless playback is artifically created using the crossfading players so it may not be perfect, YMMV.&lt;/h5&gt;

_Note: First version of the application which was developed as a PWA is available in an extra git branch._

## Download

Download the latest version of the application for macOS, Windows, and Linux from the [release page](https://github.com/4gray/iptvnator/releases).

Alternatively, you can install the application using one of the following package managers:

### Homebrew

```shell
$ brew install iptvnator
```

### Snap

```shell
$ sudo snap install iptvnator
```

### Arch

Also available as an Arch PKG, [iptvnator-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/iptvnator-bin/), in the AUR (using your favourite AUR-helper, .e.g. `yay`)

```shell
$ yay -S iptvnator-bin
```

### Gentoo

You can install IPTVnator from the [gentoo-zh overlay](https://github.com/microcai/gentoo-zh)

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: &quot;App is damaged and can&#039;t be opened&quot;

Due to Apple&#039;s Gatekeeper security and code signing requirements, you may need to remove the quarantine flag from the downloaded application:

```bash
xattr -c /Applications/IPTVnator.app
```

Alternatively, if the app is located in a different directory:

```bash
xattr -c ~/Downloads/IPTVnator.app
```

### Linux: chrome-sandbox Issues

If you encounter the following error when launching IPTVnator:

```
The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.
Rather than run without sandboxing I&#039;m aborting now.
You need to make sure that chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
```

**Solution 1: Fix chrome-sandbox permissions (Recommended for .deb/.rpm installations)**

Navigate to the IPTVnator installation directory and run:

```bash
sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
```

**Solution 2: Launch with --no-sandbox flag**

Edit the desktop launcher file to add the `--no-sandbox` flag:

1. Find your desktop file location:
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `~/.local/share/applications/iptvnator.desktop`
   - **System-wide**: `/usr/share/applications/iptvnator.desktop`

2. Edit the file and modify the `Exec` line:

   ```
   Exec=iptvnator --no-sandbox %U
   ```

3. Save the file and relaunch the application from your application menu.

Alternatively, you can launch IPTVnator from the terminal with the flag:

```bash
iptvnator --no-sandbox
```

## How to Build and Develop

Requirements:

-   Node.js with npm

1. Clone this repository and install project dependencies:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

2. Start the application:
    ```
    $ npm run serve:backend
    ```

This will open the Electron app in a separate window, while the Angular dev server will run at http://localhost:4200.

To run only the Angular app without Electron, use:

```
$ npm run serve:frontend
```

## Disclaimer

**IPTVnator doesn&#039;t provide any playlists or other digital content.**

## What is LikeC4? Why &quot;like&quot;?

LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture and tools to generate diagrams from the model.

LikeC4 is inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), but provides some flexibility.
You customize or define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in architecture model.\
Perfectly tailored to your needs.

## What does LikeC4 look like?

LikeC4 source:

## Technology Stack

Ghostfolio is a modern web application written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and organized as an [Nx](https://nx.dev) workspace.

### Backend

The backend is based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as a database together with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) and [Redis](https://redis.io) for caching.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with [Angular](https://angular.dev) and uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) with utility classes from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

## Self-hosting

We provide official container images hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ghostfolio/ghostfolio) for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7` and `linux/arm64`.

&lt;/div&gt;


## 🚫 Non-probabalistic security to prevent data exfiltration

Models could consume prompt injections via MCP uncontrollably (read your inbox, read your GitHub issues, read your customer&#039;s inquiries) and follow them resulting in data exfiltration.
