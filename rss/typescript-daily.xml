&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This project is just a demo and only supports Chinese. A formal version will be released later for better customization and the addition of more English content.

***Elegant reading of real-time and hottest news***

## Features
- Elegant design for a pleasant reading experience, keeping you up-to-date with the latest and hottest news.
- Supports Github login and data synchronization.
- Default cache duration is 30 minutes. Logged-in users can force fetch the latest data. However, the scraping interval is adjusted based on the update frequency of the content sources (as fast as every two minutes) to save resources and prevent frequent scraping that could lead to IP bans.

## Deployment

If login and caching are not required, you can directly deploy to platforms like Cloudflare Pages or Vercel. Just fork the repository and import it into the respective platform.

For Cloudflare Pages, you need to set the build command to `pnpm run build` and the build output directory to `dist/output/public`.

For login, which involves GitHub OAuth, you only need to [create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). No special permissions are required. The callback URL should be `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain).

After creating the app, you will get a Client ID and Client Secret. Different platforms have different places to set environment variables; refer to the `example.env.server` file. If running locally, rename it to `.env.server` and add the necessary values.

```env
# Github Client ID
G_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

This project primarily supports deployment on Cloudflare Pages and Docker. For Vercel, you need to set up your own database. Supported databases can be found at https://db0.unjs.io/connectors .

The Cloudflare D1 database can be used for free. To set it up, go to the Cloudflare Worker control panel and manually create a D1 database. Then, add the `database_id` and `database_name` to the corresponding fields in your `wrangler.toml` file.

If you don&#039;t have a `wrangler.toml` file, you can rename `example.wrangler.toml` to `wrangler.toml` and modify it with your configuration. The changes will take effect on your next deployment.

For Docker deployment. In the project root directory with `docker-compose.yml`, run

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Development

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Node version &gt;= 20

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

If you want to add data sources, refer to the `shared/sources`, and `server/sources` directories. The project has complete types and a simple structure; feel free to explore.

Meet Cline, an AI assistant that can use your **CLI** a**N**d **E**ditor.

Thanks to [Claude 3.7 Sonnet&#039;s agentic coding capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet), Cline can handle complex software development tasks step-by-step. With tools that let him create &amp; edit files, explore large projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), he can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support. Cline can even use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create new tools and extend his own capabilities. While autonomous AI scripts traditionally run in sandboxed environments, this extension provides a human-in-the-loop GUI to approve every file change and terminal command, providing a safe and accessible way to explore the potential of agentic AI.

1. Enter your task and add images to convert mockups into functional apps or fix bugs with screenshots.
2. Cline starts by analyzing your file structure &amp; source code ASTs, running regex searches, and reading relevant files to get up to speed in existing projects. By carefully managing what information is added to context, Cline can provide valuable assistance even for large, complex projects without overwhelming the context window.
3. Once Cline has the information he needs, he can:
    - Create and edit files + monitor linter/compiler errors along the way, letting him proactively fix issues like missing imports and syntax errors on his own.
    - Execute commands directly in your terminal and monitor their output as he works, letting him e.g., react to dev server issues after editing a file.
    - For web development tasks, Cline can launch the site in a headless browser, click, type, scroll, and capture screenshots + console logs, allowing him to fix runtime errors and visual bugs.
4. When a task is completed, Cline will present the result to you with a terminal command like `open -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; index.html`, which you run with a click of a button.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Use the `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` shortcut to open the command palette and type &quot;Cline: Open In New Tab&quot; to open the extension as a tab in your editor. This lets you use Cline side-by-side with your file explorer, and see how he changes your workspace more clearly.

### Use any API and Model

Cline supports API providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, and GCP Vertex. You can also configure any OpenAI compatible API, or use a local model through LM Studio/Ollama. If you&#039;re using OpenRouter, the extension fetches their latest model list, allowing you to use the newest models as soon as they&#039;re available.

The extension also keeps track of total tokens and API usage cost for the entire task loop and individual requests, keeping you informed of spend every step of the way.

### Run Commands in Terminal

Thanks to the new [shell integration updates in VSCode v1.93](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_terminal-shell-integration-api), Cline can execute commands directly in your terminal and receive the output. This allows him to perform a wide range of tasks, from installing packages and running build scripts to deploying applications, managing databases, and executing tests, all while adapting to your dev environment &amp; toolchain to get the job done right.

For long running processes like dev servers, use the &quot;Proceed While Running&quot; button to let Cline continue in the task while the command runs in the background. As Cline works he’ll be notified of any new terminal output along the way, letting him react to issues that may come up, such as compile-time errors when editing files.

### Create and Edit Files

Cline can create and edit files directly in your editor, presenting you a diff view of the changes. You can edit or revert Cline&#039;s changes directly in the diff view editor, or provide feedback in chat until you&#039;re satisfied with the result. Cline also monitors linter/compiler errors (missing imports, syntax errors, etc.) so he can fix issues that come up along the way on his own.

All changes made by Cline are recorded in your file&#039;s Timeline, providing an easy way to track and revert modifications if needed.

### Use the Browser

With Claude 3.5 Sonnet&#039;s new [Computer Use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) capability, Cline can launch a browser, click elements, type text, and scroll, capturing screenshots and console logs at each step. This allows for interactive debugging, end-to-end testing, and even general web use! This gives him autonomy to fixing visual bugs and runtime issues without you needing to handhold and copy-pasting error logs yourself.

Try asking Cline to &quot;test the app&quot;, and watch as he runs a command like `npm run dev`, launches your locally running dev server in a browser, and performs a series of tests to confirm that everything works. [See a demo here.](https://x.com/sdrzn/status/1850880547825823989)

### &quot;add a tool that...&quot;

Thanks to the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol), Cline can extend his capabilities through custom tools. While you can use [community-made servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), Cline can instead create and install tools tailored to your specific workflow. Just ask Cline to &quot;add a tool&quot; and he will handle everything, from creating a new MCP server to installing it into the extension. These custom tools then become part of Cline&#039;s toolkit, ready to use in future tasks.

-   &quot;add a tool that fetches Jira tickets&quot;: Retrieve ticket ACs and put Cline to work
-   &quot;add a tool that manages AWS EC2s&quot;: Check server metrics and scale instances up or down
-   &quot;add a tool that pulls the latest PagerDuty incidents&quot;: Fetch details and ask Cline to fix bugs

### Add Context

**`@url`:** Paste in a URL for the extension to fetch and convert to markdown, useful when you want to give Cline the latest docs

**`@problems`:** Add workspace errors and warnings (&#039;Problems&#039; panel) for Cline to fix

**`@file`:** Adds a file&#039;s contents so you don&#039;t have to waste API requests approving read file (+ type to search files)

**`@folder`:** Adds folder&#039;s files all at once to speed up your workflow even more

### Checkpoints: Compare and Restore

As Cline works through a task, the extension takes a snapshot of your workspace at each step. You can use the &#039;Compare&#039; button to see a diff between the snapshot and your current workspace, and the &#039;Restore&#039; button to roll back to that point.

For example, when working with a local web server, you can use &#039;Restore Workspace Only&#039; to quickly test different versions of your app, then use &#039;Restore Task and Workspace&#039; when you find the version you want to continue building from. This lets you safely explore different approaches without losing progress.

## What does n8n mean?

**Short answer:** It means &quot;nodemation&quot; and is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** &quot;I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. &#039;node-&#039; in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and &#039;-mation&#039; for &#039;automation&#039; which is what the project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on &#039;n8n&#039;.&quot; - **Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io**

**develop, monitor, evaluate,** and **debug** AI applications. Langfuse can be **self-hosted in minutes** and is **battle-tested**.

[![Langfuse Overview Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3926b288-ff61-4b95-8aa1-45d041c70866)](https://langfuse.com/watch-demo)

## ✨ Core Features

![Langfuse Overview](https://langfuse.com/images/docs/github-readme/github-feature-overview.png)

- [LLM Application Observability](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing): Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions. Try the interactive [demo](https://langfuse.com/docs/demo) to see this in action.

- [Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started) helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts. Thanks to strong caching on server and client side, you can iterate on prompts without adding latency to your application.

- [Evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview) are key to the LLM application development workflow, and Langfuse adapts to your needs. It supports LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback collection, manual labeling, and custom evaluation pipelines via APIs/SDKs.

- [Datasets](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/overview) enable test sets and benchmarks for evaluating your LLM application. They support continuous improvement, pre-deployment testing, structured experiments, flexible evaluation, and seamless integration with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.

- [LLM Playground](https://langfuse.com/docs/playground) is a tool for testing and iterating on your prompts and model configurations, shortening the feedback loop and accelerating development. When you see a bad result in tracing, you can directly jump to the playground to iterate on it.

- [Comprehensive API](https://langfuse.com/docs/api): Langfuse is frequently used to power bespoke LLMOps workflows while using the building blocks provided by Langfuse via the API. OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, and typed SDKs for Python, JS/TS are available.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions.

### 1️⃣ Create new project

1.  [Create Langfuse account](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up) or [self-host](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting)
2.  Create a new project
3.  Create new API credentials in the project settings

### 2️⃣ Log your first LLM call

The [`@observe()` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators) makes it easy to trace any Python LLM application. In this quickstart we also use the Langfuse [OpenAI integration](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai) to automatically capture all model parameters.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Not using OpenAI? Visit [our documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started#log-your-first-llm-call-to-langfuse) to learn how to log other models and frameworks.

```bash
pip install langfuse openai
```

```bash filename=&quot;.env&quot;
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=&quot;sk-lf-...&quot;
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=&quot;pk-lf-...&quot;
LANGFUSE_HOST=&quot;https://cloud.langfuse.com&quot; # 🇪🇺 EU region
# LANGFUSE_HOST=&quot;https://us.cloud.langfuse.com&quot; # 🇺🇸 US region
```

```python /@observe()/ /from langfuse.openai import openai/ filename=&quot;main.py&quot;
from langfuse.decorators import observe
from langfuse.openai import openai # OpenAI integration

@observe()
def story():
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
        messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is Langfuse?&quot;}],
    ).choices[0].message.content

@observe()
def main():
    return story()

main()
```

# 🔥 Firecrawl

Empower your AI apps with clean data from any website. Featuring advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities.

_This repository is in development, and we’re still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It&#039;s not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

## How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://firecrawl.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if you&#039;d like.

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### Features

- [**Scrape**](#scraping): scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via [LLM Extract](#llm-extraction-beta), screenshot, html)
- [**Crawl**](#crawling): scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- [**Map**](#map-alpha): input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
- [**Extract**](#extract): get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.

### Powerful Capabilities
- **LLM-ready formats**: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
- **The hard stuff**: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- **Customizability**: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc...
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
- **Batching (New)**: scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint.

You can find all of Firecrawl&#039;s capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev)

### Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;limit&quot;: 10,
      &quot;scrapeOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
      }
    }&#039;
```

Returns a crawl job id and the url to check the status of the crawl.

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;123-456-789&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789&quot;
}
```

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

```bash

      &quot;statusCode&quot;: 200
    }
  }
}
```

### Map (Alpha)

Used to map a URL and get urls of the website. This returns most links present on the website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;
    }&#039;
```

Response:

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/playground&quot;,
    &quot;https://www.firecrawl.dev/smart-crawl&quot;,
  ]
}
```

#### Map with search

Map with `search` param allows you to search for specific urls inside a website.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/map \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://firecrawl.dev&quot;,
      &quot;search&quot;: &quot;docs&quot;
    }&#039;
```

Response will be an ordered list from the most relevant to the least relevant.

```json
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;,
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;,
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/python&quot;,
    &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3&quot;,
  ]
}
```

### Extract

Get structured data from entire websites with a prompt and/or a schema.

You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards:

Single Page:
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/some-page

Multiple Pages / Full Domain
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/*

When you use /*, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/extract \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [
        &quot;https://firecrawl.dev/*&quot;, 
        &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;, 
        &quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/companies&quot;
      ],
      &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission, whether it is open source, and whether it is in Y Combinator from the page.&quot;,
      &quot;schema&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
        &quot;properties&quot;: {
          &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          },
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
          }
        },
        &quot;required&quot;: [
          &quot;company_mission&quot;,
          &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
          &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
        ]
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;44aa536d-f1cb-4706-ab87-ed0386685740&quot;,
  &quot;urlTrace&quot;: []
}
```

If you are using the sdks, it will auto pull the response for you:

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Firecrawl is the easiest way to extract data from the web. Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.&quot;,
    &quot;supports_sso&quot;: false,
    &quot;is_open_source&quot;: true,
    &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
  }
}
```

### LLM Extraction (Beta)

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.mendable.ai/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;json&quot;],
      &quot;jsonOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;schema&quot;: {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,
          &quot;properties&quot;: {
            &quot;company_mission&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;
            },
            &quot;supports_sso&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            },
            &quot;is_open_source&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            },
            &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: {
                      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;boolean&quot;
            }
          },
          &quot;required&quot;: [
            &quot;company_mission&quot;,
            &quot;supports_sso&quot;,
            &quot;is_open_source&quot;,
            &quot;is_in_yc&quot;
          ]
        }
      }
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Raw Content&quot;,
    &quot;metadata&quot;: {
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide&quot;,
      &quot;robots&quot;: &quot;follow, index&quot;,
      &quot;ogTitle&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;ogDescription&quot;: &quot;Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide&quot;,
      &quot;ogUrl&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/&quot;,
      &quot;ogImage&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/mendable_new_og1.png&quot;,
      &quot;ogLocaleAlternate&quot;: [],
      &quot;ogSiteName&quot;: &quot;Mendable&quot;,
      &quot;sourceURL&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai/&quot;
    },
    &quot;json&quot;: {
      &quot;company_mission&quot;: &quot;Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn&#039;t have to&quot;,
      &quot;supports_sso&quot;: true,
      &quot;is_open_source&quot;: false,
      &quot;is_in_yc&quot;: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Extracting without a schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/&quot;,
      &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;json&quot;],
      &quot;jsonOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Extract the company mission from the page.&quot;
      }
    }&#039;
```

### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;google.com&quot;,
        &quot;formats&quot;: [&quot;markdown&quot;],
        &quot;actions&quot;: [
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;textarea[title=\&quot;Search\&quot;]&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;write&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;firecrawl&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 2000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;press&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;ENTER&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;click&quot;, &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;h3&quot;},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;milliseconds&quot;: 3000},
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;screenshot&quot;}
        ]
    }&#039;
```

### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/batch/scrape \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev&quot;, &quot;https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview&quot;],
      &quot;formats&quot; : [&quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;html&quot;]
    }&#039;
```

### Search

The search endpoint combines web search with Firecrawl’s scraping capabilities to return full page content for any query.

Include `scrapeOptions` with `formats: [&quot;markdown&quot;]` to get complete markdown content for each search result otherwise it defaults to getting SERP results (url, title, description).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search \
    -H &#039;Content-Type: application/json&#039; \
    -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&#039; \
    -d &#039;{
      &quot;query&quot;: &quot;What is Mendable?&quot;
    }&#039;
```

```json
{
  &quot;success&quot;: true,
  &quot;data&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mendable.ai&quot;,
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Mendable | AI for CX and Sales&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;AI for CX and Sales&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=&quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;)

# Scrape a website:
scrape_status = app.scrape_url(
  &#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, 
  params={&#039;formats&#039;: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;]}
)
print(scrape_status)

# Crawl a website:
crawl_status = app.crawl_url(
  &#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, 
  params={
    &#039;limit&#039;: 100, 
    &#039;scrapeOptions&#039;: {&#039;formats&#039;: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;]}
  },
  poll_interval=30
)
print(crawl_status)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python

from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=&quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;)

class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):
    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., max_items=5, description=&quot;Top 5 stories&quot;)

data = app.scrape_url(&#039;https://news.ycombinator.com&#039;, {
    &#039;formats&#039;: [&#039;json&#039;],
    &#039;jsonOptions&#039;: {
        &#039;schema&#039;: TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema()
    }
})
print(data[&quot;json&quot;])
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

```js
import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from &#039;@mendable/firecrawl-js&#039;;

const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: &quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;});

// Scrape a website
const scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {
  formats: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;],
});

if (scrapeResponse) {
  console.log(scrapeResponse)
}

// Crawl a website
const crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl(&#039;https://firecrawl.dev&#039;, {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: [&#039;markdown&#039;, &#039;html&#039;],
  }
} satisfies CrawlParams, true, 30) satisfies CrawlStatusResponse;

if (crawlResponse) {
  console.log(crawlResponse)
}
```


### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:

```js
import FirecrawlApp from &quot;@mendable/firecrawl-js&quot;;
import { z } from &quot;zod&quot;;

const app = new FirecrawlApp({
  apiKey: &quot;fc-YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
});

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe(&quot;Top 5 stories on Hacker News&quot;),
});

const scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl(&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;, {
  jsonOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },
});

console.log(scrapeResult.data[&quot;json&quot;]);
```

Genkit is a framework for building AI-powered applications. It provides open source libraries for Node.js and Go, along with tools to help you debug and iterate quickly.

Learn more in our documentation for [Node.js](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) and [Go](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit-go/get-started-go).

## What can you build with Genkit?

Genkit is a versatile framework, which you can use to build many different types of AI applications. Common use cases include:

- **Intelligent agents:** Create agents that understand user requests and perform tasks autonomously, such as personalized travel planning or itinerary generation.

  - Example: [Compass Travel Planning App](https://developers.google.com/solutions/compass)

- **Data transformation:** Convert unstructured data, like natural language, into structured formats (e.g., objects, SQL queries, tables) for integration into your app or data pipeline.

  - Example: [Add Natural Language AI Data Filters with Genkit](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/how-to-add-natural-language-ai-data-filters-to-your-app-71d64a79624d)

- **Retrieval-augmented generation:** Create apps that provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by grounding generation with your own data sources, such as chatbots or question answering systems.
  - Example: [Build AI features powered by your data](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/ai-genkit-rag#0)

## Who should use Genkit?

Genkit is built for developers seeking to add generative AI to their apps with Node.js or Go, and can run anywhere these runtimes are supported. It&#039;s designed around a plugin architecture that can work with any generative model API or vector database, with many integrations [already available](#plugin-ecosystem).

While developed by the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) team, Genkit can be used independently of Firebase or Google Cloud services.

## Get started

- [Node.js quickstart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/get-started)
- [Next.js quickstart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/nextjs)
- [Go quickstart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit-go/get-started-go)

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Genkit for Go is in alpha, so we only recommend it for prototyping.

## Library key features

- **Unified generation API:** Generate text, media, structured objects, and tool calls from any generative model using a single, adaptable API.

- **Vector database support:** Add retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to your apps with simple indexing and retrieval APIs that work across vector database providers.

- **Enhanced prompt engineering:** Define rich prompt templates, model configurations, input/output schemas, and tools all within a single, runnable [.prompt](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/dotprompt) file.

- **AI workflows:** Organize your AI app logic into [Flows](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/flows) - functions designed for observability, streaming, integration with Genkit devtools, and easy deployment as API endpoints.

- **Built-in streaming:** Stream content from your Genkit API endpoints to your client app to create snappy user experiences.

## Development tools

Genkit provides a CLI and a local UI to streamline your AI development workflow.

### CLI

The Genkit CLI includes commands for running and evaluating your Genkit functions (flows) and collecting telemetry and logs.

- **Install:** `npm i -g genkit`
- **Run a command, wrapped with telemetry, a interactive developer UI, etc:** `genkit start -- &lt;command to run your code&gt;`

### Developer UI

The Genkit developer UI is a local interface for testing, debugging, and iterating on your AI application.

Key features:

- **Run:** Execute and experiment with Genkit flows, prompts, queries, and more in dedicated playgrounds.
- **Inspect:** Analyze detailed traces of past executions, including step-by-step breakdowns of complex flows.
- **Evaluate:** Review the results of evaluations run against your flows, including performance metrics and links to relevant traces.

  - [Additional testing](#additional-testing)

## Pre-requisites

- Before proceeding, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20.11.0 is required)
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Verification

To verify the installation, perform the following checks in your terminal:

- Ensure that the `docker` commands are available:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  docker compose version
## Fast start

```bash
sh ./scripts/fast-start.sh
```

## Installation

You need Microsoft&#039;s [rush](https://rushjs.io) to install application.

1. Install Rush globally using the command:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/rush
2. Navigate to the repository root and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   rush install
   rush build
Alternatively, you can just execute:

```bash
sh ./scripts/presetup-rush.sh
```

## Build and run

Development environment setup requires Docker to be installed on system.

Support is available for both amd64 and arm64 containers on Linux and macOS.

```bash
cd ./dev/
rush build    # Will build all the required packages. 
# rush rebuild  # could be used to omit build cache.
rush bundle   # Will prepare bundles.
rush package  # Will build all webpack packages.
rush validate # Will validate all sources with typescript and generate d.ts files required for ts-node execution.
rush svelte-check # Optional. svelte files validation using svelte-check.
rush docker:build   # Will build Docker containers for all applications in the local Docker environment.
rush docker:up # Will set up all the containers
```

Be aware `rush docker:build` will automatically execute all required phases like build, bundle, package.

Alternatively, you can just execute:

```bash
sh ./scripts/build.sh
```

By default, Docker volumes named dev_db, dev_elastic, and dev_files will be created for the MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and MinIO instances.

Before you can begin, you need to create a workspace and an account and associate it with the workspace.

```bash
cd ./tool # dev/tool in the repository root
rushx run-local create-workspace ws1 -w DevWorkspace # Create workspace
rushx run-local create-account user1 -p 1234 -f John -l Appleseed # Create account
rushx run-local configure ws1 --list --enable &#039;*&#039; # Enable all modules, even if they are not yet intended to be used by a wide audience.
rushx run-local assign-workspace user1 ws1 # Assign workspace to user.
rushx run-local confirm-email user1 # To allow the creation of additional test workspaces.

```

Alternatively, you can just execute:

```bash
sh ./scripts/create-workspace.sh
```

Add the following line to your /etc/hosts file

```
127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal
```

Accessing the URL http://host.docker.internal:8087 will lead you to the app in development mode.

Limitations:

- Local installation does not support sending emails, thus disabling functionalities such as password recovery and email notifications.

## Run in development mode

Development mode allows for live reloading and a smoother development process.

```bash
cd dev/prod
rush validate
rushx dev-server
```

Then go to http://localhost:8080

Click on &quot;Login with password&quot; link on the bottom of the right panel and use the following login credentials:

```plain
Email: user1
Password: 1234
Workspace: ws1
```

## Update project structure and database

If the project&#039;s structure is updated, it may be necessary to relink and rebuild the projects.

```bash
rush update
rush build
```

It may also be necessary to upgrade the running database.

```bash
cd ./dev/tool
rushx upgrade -f
```

## Troubleshooting

If a build fails, but the code is correct, try to delete the [build cache](https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/build_cache/) and retry.

```bash
# from the project root
rm -rf common/temp/build-cache
```

## Build &amp; Watch

For development purpose `rush build:watch` action could be used.

It includes build and validate phases in watch mode.

## Tests

### Unit tests

```bash
rush test # To execute all tests

rushx test # For individual test execution inside a package directory
```

### UI tests

```bash
cd ./tests
rush build
rush bundle
rush docker:build
## creates test Docker containers and sets up test database
./prepare.sh
## runs UI tests
rushx uitest
```

To execute tests in the development environment, please follow these steps:

```bash
cd ./tests
./create-local.sh ## use ./restore-local.sh if you only want to restore the workspace to a predefined initial state for sanity.
cd ./sanity
rushx dev-uitest # To execute all tests against the development environment.
rushx dev-debug -g &#039;pattern&#039; # To execute tests in debug mode with only the matching test pattern.
```

## Package publishing

```bash
node ./common/scripts/bump.js -p projectName
```

## Additional testing

This project is tested with BrowserStack.

**[MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/)** is an open-source library for publishing maps on your websites or webview based apps. Fast displaying of maps is possible thanks to GPU-accelerated vector tile rendering.

It originated as an open-source fork of [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), before their switch to a non-OSS license in December 2020. The library&#039;s initial versions (1.x) were intended to be a drop-in replacement for the Mapbox’s OSS version (1.x) with additional functionality, but have evolved a lot since then.

## Getting Started

Include the JavaScript and CSS files in the `&lt;head&gt;` of your HTML file.

```html
&lt;script src=&#039;https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@latest/dist/maplibre-gl.js&#039;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link href=&#039;https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@latest/dist/maplibre-gl.css&#039; rel=&#039;stylesheet&#039; /&gt;
```

Include the following code in the `&lt;body&gt;` of your HTML file.

```html
&lt;div id=&#039;map&#039; style=&#039;width: 400px; height: 300px;&#039;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var map = new maplibregl.Map({
  container: &#039;map&#039;,
  style: &#039;https://demotiles.maplibre.org/style.json&#039;, // stylesheet location
  center: [-74.5, 40], // starting position [lng, lat]
  zoom: 9 // starting zoom
});
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Enjoy the map!

## Thank you Mapbox 🙏🏽

We&#039;d like to acknowledge the amazing work Mapbox has contributed to open source. The open source community is sad to part ways with them, but we simultaneously feel grateful for everything they already contributed. `mapbox-gl-js` 1.x is an open source achievement that now lives on as `maplibre-gl`. We&#039;re proud to develop on the shoulders of giants, thank you Mapbox 🙇🏽‍♀️.

Please keep in mind: Unauthorized backports are the biggest threat to the MapLibre project. It is unacceptable to backport code from mapbox-gl-js, which is not covered by the former BSD-3 license. If you are unsure about this issue, [please ask](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/discussions)!

Superset can query data from any SQL-speaking datastore or data engine (Presto, Trino, Athena, [and more](https://superset.apache.org/docs/configuration/databases)) that has a Python DB-API driver and a SQLAlchemy dialect.

Here are some of the major database solutions that are supported:

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production.

## Quick start

&gt; Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
&gt;
&gt; - CPU &gt;= 2 Core
&gt; - RAM &gt;= 4 GiB

&lt;/br&gt;

The easiest way to start the Dify server is through [docker compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running Dify with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

#### Seeking help

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data-driven culture:

- **Visualizations:** Fast and flexible client side graphs with a multitude of options. Panel plugins offer many different ways to visualize metrics and logs.
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dynamic &amp; reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.
- **Explore Metrics:** Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.
- **Explore Logs:** Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live.
- **Alerting:** Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie.
- **Mixed Data Sources:** Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom datasources.
