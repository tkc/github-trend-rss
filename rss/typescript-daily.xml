## 🎯 What is Shannon?

Shannon is an AI pentester that delivers actual exploits, not just alerts.

Shannon&#039;s goal is to break your web app before someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.

**What Problem Does Shannon Solve?**

Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a *massive* security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.

Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester. It doesn&#039;t just find potential issues. It executes real exploits, providing concrete proof of vulnerabilities. This lets you ship with confidence, knowing every build can be secured.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **From Autonomous Pentesting to Automated Compliance**
&gt;
&gt; Shannon is a core component of the **Keygraph Security and Compliance Platform**.
&gt;
&gt; While Shannon automates the critical task of penetration testing for your application, our broader platform automates your entire compliance journey—from evidence collection to audit readiness. We&#039;re building the &quot;Rippling for Cybersecurity,&quot; a single platform to manage your security posture and streamline compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and HIPAA.

## 🚀 Setup &amp; Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **AI Provider Credentials** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API key** (recommended) - Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
  - **Claude Code OAuth token**
  - **[EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Alternative providers via Router Mode** - OpenAI or Google Gemini via OpenRouter (see [Router Mode](#experimental---unsupported-router-mode-alternative-providers))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone Shannon
git clone https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon.git
cd shannon

# 2. Configure credentials (choose one method)

# Option A: Export environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;              # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000           # recommended

# Option B: Create a .env file
cat &gt; .env &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
EOF

# 3. Run a pentest
./shannon start URL=https://your-app.com REPO=/path/to/your/repo
```

Shannon will build the containers, start the workflow, and return a workflow ID. The pentest runs in the background.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# View real-time worker logs
./shannon logs

# Query a specific workflow&#039;s progress
./shannon query ID=shannon-1234567890

# Open the Temporal Web UI for detailed monitoring
open http://localhost:8233
```

### Stopping Shannon

```bash
# Stop all containers (preserves workflow data)
./shannon stop

# Full cleanup (removes all data)
./shannon stop CLEAN=true
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic pentest
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo

# With a configuration file
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo CONFIG=./configs/my-config.yaml

# Custom output directory
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo OUTPUT=./my-reports
```

### Prepare Your Repository

Shannon is designed for **web application security testing** and expects all application code to be available in a single directory structure. This works well for:

- **Monorepos** - Single repository containing all components
- **Consolidated setups** - Multiple repositories organized in a shared folder

**For monorepos:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-monorepo.git /path/to/your-app
```

**For multi-repository applications** (e.g., separate frontend/backend):

```bash
mkdir /path/to/your-app
cd /path/to/your-app
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/api.git
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Linux (Native Docker):**

You may need to run commands with `sudo` depending on your Docker setup. If you encounter permission issues with output files, ensure your user has access to the Docker socket.

**For macOS:**

Works out of the box with Docker Desktop installed.

**Testing Local Applications:**

Docker containers cannot reach `localhost` on your host machine. Use `host.docker.internal` in place of `localhost`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 REPO=/path/to/repo
```

### Configuration (Optional)

While you can run without a config file, creating one enables authenticated testing and customized analysis.

#### Create Configuration File

Copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
cp configs/example-config.yaml configs/my-app-config.yaml
```

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
authentication:
  login_type: form
  login_url: &quot;https://your-app.com/login&quot;
  credentials:
    username: &quot;test@example.com&quot;
    password: &quot;yourpassword&quot;
    totp_secret: &quot;LB2E2RX7XFHSTGCK&quot;  # Optional for 2FA

  login_flow:
    - &quot;Type $username into the email field&quot;
    - &quot;Type $password into the password field&quot;
    - &quot;Click the &#039;Sign In&#039; button&quot;

  success_condition:
    type: url_contains
    value: &quot;/dashboard&quot;

rules:
  avoid:
    - description: &quot;AI should avoid testing logout functionality&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/logout&quot;

  focus:
    - description: &quot;AI should emphasize testing API endpoints&quot;
      type: path
      url_path: &quot;/api&quot;
```

#### TOTP Setup for 2FA

If your application uses two-factor authentication, simply add the TOTP secret to your config file. The AI will automatically generate the required codes during testing.

### [EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Router Mode (Alternative Providers)

Shannon can experimentally route requests through alternative AI providers using claude-code-router. This mode is not officially supported and is intended primarily for:

* **Model experimentation** — try Shannon with GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3–family models

#### Quick Setup

1. Add your provider API key to `.env`:

```bash
# Choose one provider:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Set default model:
ROUTER_DEFAULT=openai,gpt-5.2  # provider,model format
```

2. Run with `ROUTER=true`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=/path/to/repo ROUTER=true
```

#### Experimental Models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-5.2, gpt-5-mini |
| OpenRouter | google/gemini-3-flash-preview |

#### Disclaimer

This feature is experimental and unsupported. Output quality depends heavily on the model. Shannon is built on top of the Anthropic Agent SDK and is optimized and primarily tested with Anthropic Claude models. Alternative providers may produce inconsistent results (including failing early phases like Recon) depending on the model and routing setup.

### Output and Results

All results are saved to `./audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/` by default. Use `--output &lt;path&gt;` to specify a custom directory.

Output structure:
```
audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/
├── session.json          # Metrics and session data
├── agents/               # Per-agent execution logs
├── prompts/              # Prompt snapshots for reproducibility
└── deliverables/
    └── comprehensive_security_assessment_report.md   # Final comprehensive security report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shannon emulates a human penetration tester&#039;s methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. It combines white-box source code analysis with black-box dynamic exploitation across four distinct phases:

### Architectural Overview

Shannon is engineered to emulate the methodology of a human penetration tester. It leverages Anthropic&#039;s Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of **white-box source code analysis** with the real-world validation of **black-box dynamic exploitation**, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.

---

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application&#039;s attack surface. Shannon analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.

#### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of **hypothesized exploitable paths** that are passed on for validation.

#### **Phase 3: Exploitation**

Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict **&quot;No Exploit, No Report&quot;** policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.

#### **Phase 4: Reporting**

The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with **reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts**, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.


## 📋 Coverage and Roadmap

## 🚀 How to Run

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
bun start
```

Or with watch mode for development:
```bash
bun dev
```

## 📊 How to Evaluate

Dexter includes an evaluation suite that tests the agent against a dataset of financial questions. Evals use LangSmith for tracking and an LLM-as-judge approach for scoring correctness.

**Run on all questions:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts
```

**Run on a random sample of data:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts --sample 10
```

The eval runner displays a real-time UI showing progress, current question, and running accuracy statistics. Results are logged to LangSmith for analysis.

## 🐛 How to Debug

Dexter logs all tool calls to a scratchpad file for debugging and history tracking. Each query creates a new JSONL file in `.dexter/scratchpad/`.

**Scratchpad location:**
```
.dexter/scratchpad/
├── 2026-01-30-111400_9a8f10723f79.jsonl
├── 2026-01-30-143022_a1b2c3d4e5f6.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each file contains newline-delimited JSON entries tracking:
- **init**: The original query
- **tool_result**: Each tool call with arguments, raw result, and LLM summary
- **thinking**: Agent reasoning steps

**Example scratchpad entry:**
```json
{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;tool_result&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:&quot;2026-01-30T11:14:05.123Z&quot;,&quot;toolName&quot;:&quot;get_income_statements&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:{&quot;ticker&quot;:&quot;AAPL&quot;,&quot;period&quot;:&quot;annual&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:5},&quot;result&quot;:{...},&quot;llmSummary&quot;:&quot;Retrieved 5 years of Apple annual income statements showing revenue growth from $274B to $394B&quot;}
```

This makes it easy to inspect exactly what data the agent gathered and how it interpreted results.

## 快速开始

### 1. 使用在线版本（推荐）

直接访问：[https://prompt.always200.com](https://prompt.always200.com)

项目是纯前端项目，所有数据只存储在浏览器本地，不会上传至任何服务器，因此直接使用在线版本也是安全可靠的

### 2. Vercel部署
方式1：一键部署到自己的Vercel(方便，但后续无法自动更新)：
   [![部署到 Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flinshenkx%2Fprompt-optimizer)

方式2: Fork项目后在Vercel中导入（推荐，但需参考部署文档进行手动设置）：
   - 先Fork项目到自己的GitHub
   - 然后在Vercel中导入该项目
   - 可跟踪源项目更新，便于同步最新功能和修复
- 配置环境变量：
  - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`：设置访问密码，启用访问限制
  - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`等：配置各AI服务商的API密钥

更多详细的部署步骤和注意事项，请查看：
- [Vercel部署指南](docs/user/deployment/vercel.md)

### 3. 下载桌面应用
从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer/releases) 下载最新版本。我们为各平台提供**安装程序**和**压缩包**两种格式。

    # 或使用阿里云镜像（国内用户推荐）
    # image: registry.cn-guangzhou.aliyuncs.com/prompt-optimizer/prompt-optimizer:latest
    container_name: prompt-optimizer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - &quot;8081:80&quot;  # Web应用端口（包含MCP服务器，通过/mcp路径访问）
    environment:
      # API密钥配置
      - VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
      - VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
      # 访问控制（可选）
      - ACCESS_USERNAME=admin
      - ACCESS_PASSWORD=your_password
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### 7. MCP Server 使用说明
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看 MCP Server 使用说明&lt;/summary&gt;

Prompt Optimizer 现在支持 Model Context Protocol (MCP) 协议，可以与 Claude Desktop 等支持 MCP 的 AI 应用集成。

当通过 Docker 运行时，MCP Server 会自动启动，并可通过 `http://ip:port/mcp` 访问。

#### 环境变量配置

MCP Server 需要配置 API 密钥才能正常工作。主要的 MCP 专属配置：

```bash
# MCP 服务器配置
MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai  # 可选值：openai, gemini, deepseek, siliconflow, zhipu, custom
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info                 # 日志级别
```

#### Docker 环境下使用 MCP

在 Docker 环境中，MCP Server 会与 Web 应用一起运行，您可以通过 Web 应用的相同端口访问 MCP 服务，路径为 `/mcp`。

例如，如果您将容器的 80 端口映射到主机的 8081 端口：
```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:80 \
  -e VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key \
  -e MCP_DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai \
  --name prompt-optimizer \
  linshen/prompt-optimizer
```

那么 MCP Server 将可以通过 `http://localhost:8081/mcp` 访问。

#### Claude Desktop 集成示例

要在 Claude Desktop 中使用 Prompt Optimizer，您需要在 Claude Desktop 的配置文件中添加服务配置。

1. 找到 Claude Desktop 的配置目录：
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\services`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/services`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/services`

2. 编辑或创建 `services.json` 文件，添加以下内容：

```json
{
  &quot;services&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Prompt Optimizer&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8081/mcp&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

请确保将 `localhost:8081` 替换为您实际部署 Prompt Optimizer 的地址和端口。

#### 可用工具

- **optimize-user-prompt**: 优化用户提示词以提高 LLM 性能
- **optimize-system-prompt**: 优化系统提示词以提高 LLM 性能
- **iterate-prompt**: 对已经成熟/完善的提示词进行定向迭代优化

更多详细信息，请查看 [MCP 服务器用户指南](docs/user/mcp-server.md)。
&lt;/details&gt;

## ⚙️ API密钥配置

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看API密钥配置方法&lt;/summary&gt;

### 方式一：通过界面配置（推荐）
1. 点击界面右上角的&quot;⚙️设置&quot;按钮
2. 选择&quot;模型管理&quot;选项卡
3. 点击需要配置的模型（如OpenAI、Gemini、DeepSeek等）
4. 在弹出的配置框中输入对应的API密钥
5. 点击&quot;保存&quot;即可

支持的模型：OpenAI、Gemini、DeepSeek、Zhipu智谱、SiliconFlow、自定义API（OpenAI兼容接口）

除了API密钥，您还可以在模型配置界面为每个模型单独设置高级LLM参数。这些参数通过一个名为 `llmParams` 的字段进行配置，它允许您以键值对的形式指定LLM SDK支持的任何参数，从而更精细地控制模型行为。

**高级LLM参数配置示例：**
- **OpenAI/兼容API**: `{&quot;temperature&quot;: 0.7, &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 4096, &quot;timeout&quot;: 60000}`
- **Gemini**: `{&quot;temperature&quot;: 0.8, &quot;maxOutputTokens&quot;: 2048, &quot;topP&quot;: 0.95}`
- **DeepSeek**: `{&quot;temperature&quot;: 0.5, &quot;top_p&quot;: 0.9, &quot;frequency_penalty&quot;: 0.1}`

有关 `llmParams` 的更详细说明和配置指南，请参阅 [LLM参数配置指南](docs/developer/llm-params-guide.md)。

### 方式二：通过环境变量配置
Docker部署时通过 `-e` 参数配置环境变量：

```bash

## 常见问题

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;点击查看常见问题解答&lt;/summary&gt;

### API连接问题

#### Q1: 为什么配置好API密钥后仍然无法连接到模型服务？
**A**: 大多数连接失败是由**跨域问题**（CORS）导致的。由于本项目是纯前端应用，浏览器出于安全考虑会阻止直接访问不同源的API服务。模型服务如未正确配置CORS策略，会拒绝来自浏览器的直接请求。

#### Q2: 如何解决本地Ollama的连接问题？
**A**: Ollama完全支持OpenAI标准接口，只需配置正确的跨域策略：
1. 设置环境变量 `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` 允许任意来源的请求
2. 如仍有问题，设置 `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` 监听任意IP地址

#### Q3: 如何解决商业API（如Nvidia的DS API、字节跳动的火山API）的跨域问题？
**A**: 这些平台通常有严格的跨域限制，推荐以下解决方案：

1. **使用桌面版应用**（最推荐）
   - 桌面应用作为原生应用，完全没有跨域限制
   - 可以直接连接任何API服务，包括本地部署的模型
   - 提供最完整、最稳定的功能体验
   - 从 [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/linshenkx/prompt-optimizer/releases) 下载

2. **使用自部署的API中转服务**（专业方案）
   - 部署如OneAPI、NewAPI等开源API聚合/代理工具
   - 在设置中配置为自定义API端点
   - 请求流向：浏览器→中转服务→模型服务提供商
   - 完全控制安全策略和访问权限

**注意**：Web版（包括在线版、Vercel部署、Docker部署）都是纯前端应用，都会受到浏览器CORS限制。只有桌面版或使用API中转服务才能解决跨域问题。

#### Q4: 我已正确配置本地模型（如Ollama）的跨域策略，为什么使用在线版依然无法连接？
**A**: 这是由浏览器的**混合内容（Mixed Content）安全策略**导致的。出于安全考虑，浏览器会阻止安全的HTTPS页面（如在线版）向不安全的HTTP地址（如您的本地Ollama服务）发送请求。

**解决方案**：
为了绕过此限制，您需要让应用和API处于同一种协议下（例如，都是HTTP）。推荐以下方式：
1. **使用桌面版**：桌面应用没有浏览器限制，是连接本地模型最稳定可靠的方式
2. **使用Docker部署（HTTP）**：通过 `http://localhost:8081` 访问，与本地Ollama都是HTTP
3. **使用Chrome插件**：插件在某些情况下也可以绕过部分安全限制

### macOS 桌面应用问题

#### Q5: macOS 打开应用时提示「已损坏」或「无法验证开发者」怎么办？
**A**: 这是因为应用未经过 Apple 签名认证。由于 Apple 开发者账号费用较高，目前桌面应用暂未进行签名。

**解决方案**：
在终端中执行以下命令移除安全隔离属性：

```bash
# 对于已安装的应用
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PromptOptimizer.app

# 对于下载的 .dmg 文件（安装前执行）
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/PromptOptimizer-*.dmg
```

执行后重新打开应用即可正常使用。

&lt;/details&gt;

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connect remote networks with sites**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pangolin&#039;s lightweight site connectors create secure tunnels from remote networks without requiring public IP addresses or open ports. Sites make any network anywhere available for authorized access.                                                                                                                                                                                   | &lt;img src=&quot;public/screenshots/sites.png&quot; width=500 /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;               |
| **Browser-based reverse proxy access**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expose web applications through identity and context-aware tunneled reverse proxies. Pangolin handles routing, load balancing, health checking, and automatic SSL certificates without exposing your network directly to the internet. Users access applications through any web browser with authentication and granular access control.                                                                                                  | &lt;img src=&quot;public/clip.gif&quot; width=500 /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;          |
| **Client-based private resource access**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Access private resources like SSH servers, databases, RDP, and entire network ranges through Pangolin clients. Intelligent NAT traversal enables connections even through restrictive firewalls, while DNS aliases provide friendly names and fast connections to resources across all your sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                | &lt;img src=&quot;public/screenshots/private-resources.png&quot; width=500 /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;               |
| **Zero-trust granular access**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant users access to specific resources, not entire networks. Unlike traditional VPNs that expose full network access, Pangolin&#039;s zero-trust model ensures users can only reach the applications and services you explicitly define, reducing security risk and attack surface.                                                                                                                                                                                    | &lt;img src=&quot;public/screenshots/user-devices.png&quot; width=500 /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; |

## **🚀 Getting Started with Open Source Cowork**

&gt; **🔓 Build in Public** — Eigent is **100% open source** from day one. Every feature, every commit, every decision is transparent. We believe the best AI tools should be built openly with the community, not behind closed doors.

### 🏠 Local Deployment (Recommended)

The recommended way to run Eigent — fully standalone with complete control over your data, no cloud account required.

👉 **[Full Local Deployment Guide](./server/README_EN.md)**

This setup includes:

- Local backend server with full API
- Local model integration (vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- Complete isolation from cloud services
- Zero external dependencies

### ⚡ Quick Start (Cloud-Connected)

For a quick preview using our cloud backend — get started in seconds:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18-22) and npm

#### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eigent-ai/eigent.git
cd eigent
npm install
npm run dev
```

&gt; Note: This mode connects to Eigent cloud services and requires account registration. For a fully standalone experience, use [Local Deployment](#-local-deployment-recommended) instead.

#### Updating Dependencies

After pulling new code (`git pull`), update both frontend and backend dependencies:

```bash
# 1. Update frontend dependencies (in project root)
npm install

# 2. Update backend/Python dependencies (in backend directory)
cd backend
uv sync
```

### 🏢 Enterprise

For organizations requiring maximum security, customization, and control:

- **Exclusive Features** (like SSO &amp; custom development)
- **Scalable Enterprise Deployment**
- **Negotiated SLAs** &amp; implementation services

## Development Resources

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application, written in the TypeScript programming language. It builds on the `atproto` TypeScript packages (like [`@atproto/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api)), which are also open source, but in [a different git repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto).

There is a small amount of Go language source code (in `./bskyweb/`), for a web service that returns the React Native Web application.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with the app itself.

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (&quot;AT Protocol&quot; or &quot;atproto&quot;) is a decentralized social media protocol. You don&#039;t *need* to understand AT Protocol to work with this application, but it can help. Learn more at:

- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions) 👈 Great place to ask questions
- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)
- [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

The Bluesky Social application encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol framework. The namespace for these &quot;Lexicons&quot; is `app.bsky.*`.

Acontext is a context data platform for production AI agents. Think of it as Supabase, but purpose-built for agent context.

We help agents scale from local demos to production without rebuilding context infrastructure — giving you unified storage, built-in context engineering, and context observability out of the box.



# ❓ Why use Acontext

#### Challenges in Building Agents

- Context data like **llm messages, files, and skills are scattered** across different storages
- **Long-running agents need context management**, and you have to build it yourself
- **Tracking states from multi-modal, multi-llm Agents is a nightmare**, how you know your agent is great?

#### How Acontext Solves It

- **One unified storage** for messages, files, skills, and more. Integrated with Claude Agent SDK, AI-SDK, OpenAI SDK...
- **Built-in context management** methods — just one argument, zero code
- **Replay** agent trajectory in Dashboard
- **Observe** agent with background monitor to estimate success rate

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Acontext - Simple Context Storage for Cloud Agents&quot; src=&quot;./assets/acontext-components.png&quot;&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;


# 💡 Core Features

- **Context Storage**
  - [Session](https://docs.acontext.io/store/messages/multi-provider): save agent history from any llm, any modal.
    - [Context Editing](https://docs.acontext.io/engineering/editing) - edit context window in one api.
  - [Disk](https://docs.acontext.io/store/disk): virtual, persistent filesystem,
  - [Agent Skills](https://docs.acontext.io/store/skill) - manage skills in server-side.
  - [Sandbox](https://docs.acontext.io/store/sandbox) - run code, analyze data, export artifacts.


- **Context Observability**
  - [Session Summary](https://docs.acontext.io/observe/agent_tasks): asynchronously summarize agent&#039;s progress and user feedback.
  - [State Tracking](https://docs.acontext.io/observe/agent_tasks): collect agent&#039;s working status in near real-time.
- **View everything in one [dashboard](https://docs.acontext.io/observe/dashboard)**

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Dashboard&quot; src=&quot;./docs/images/dashboard/BI.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dashboard of Agent Success Rate and Other Metrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





# 🚀 Step-by-step Quickstart

### Connect to Acontext

1. Go to [Acontext.io](https://acontext.io), claim your free credits.
2. Go through a one-click onboarding to get your API Key (starts with `sk-ac`)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;Dashboard&quot; src=&quot;./assets/onboard.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💻 Self-host Acontext&lt;/summary&gt;

We have an `acontext-cli` to help you do quick proof-of-concept. Download it first in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.acontext.io | sh
```

You should have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and an OpenAI API Key to start an Acontext backend on your computer:

```bash
mkdir acontext_server &amp;&amp; cd acontext_server
acontext server up
```

&gt; Make sure your LLM has the ability to [call tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). By default, Acontext will use `gpt-4.1`.

`acontext server up` will create/use  `.env` and `config.yaml` for Acontext, and create a `db` folder to persist data.



Once it&#039;s done, you can access the following endpoints:

- Acontext API Base URL: http://localhost:8029/api/v1
- Acontext Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/

&lt;/details&gt;



### Install SDKs

We&#039;re maintaining Python [![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/acontext.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/acontext/) and Typescript [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@acontext/acontext.svg?logo=npm&amp;logoColor=fff&amp;style=flat&amp;labelColor=2C2C2C&amp;color=28CF8D)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acontext/acontext) SDKs. The snippets below are using Python.

&gt; Click the doc link to see TS SDK Quickstart.

```bash
pip install acontext
```


### Initialize Client

```python
import os
from acontext import AcontextClient

# For cloud:
client = AcontextClient(
    api_key=os.getenv(&quot;ACONTEXT_API_KEY&quot;),
)

# For self-hosted:
client = AcontextClient(
    base_url=&quot;http://localhost:8029/api/v1&quot;,
    api_key=&quot;sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token&quot;,
)
```



### Store &amp; Get Messages

&gt; [Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/store/messages/multi-provider)

Store messages in OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini format. Auto-converts on retrieval.

```python
# Create session and store messages
session = client.sessions.create()

# Store text, image, file, etc.
client.sessions.store_message(
    session_id=session.id,
    blob={&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello!&quot;},
    format=&quot;openai&quot;
)

# Retrieve in any format (auto-converts)
result = client.sessions.get_messages(session_id=session.id, format=&quot;anthropic&quot;)
```

### Context Engineering

&gt; [Session Summary](https://docs.acontext.io/engineering/session_summary) | [Context Editing](https://docs.acontext.io/engineering/editing)

Compress context with summaries and edit strategies. Original messages unchanged.

```python
# Session summary for prompt injection
summary = client.sessions.get_session_summary(session_id)
system_prompt = f&quot;Previous tasks:\n{summary}\n\nContinue helping.&quot;

# Context editing - limit tokens on retrieval
result = client.sessions.get_messages(
    session_id=session_id,
    edit_strategies=[
        {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;remove_tool_result&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;keep_recent_n_tool_results&quot;: 3}},
        {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;token_limit&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {&quot;limit_tokens&quot;: 30000}}
    ]
)
```

### Agent Storage Tools
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Disk Tool&lt;/summary&gt;



&gt; [Tool Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/tool/disk_tools) | [SDK Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/store/disk)
&gt; 
Persistent file storage for agents. Supports read, write, grep, glob.

```python
from acontext.agent.disk import DISK_TOOLS
from openai import OpenAI

disk = client.disks.create()
ctx = DISK_TOOLS.format_context(client, disk.id)

# Pass to LLM
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;,
    messages=[
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;You have disk access.\n\n{ctx.get_context_prompt()}&quot;},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Create a todo.md with 3 tasks&quot;}
    ],
    tools=DISK_TOOLS.to_openai_tool_schema()
)

# Execute tool calls
for tc in response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    result = DISK_TOOLS.execute_tool(ctx, tc.function.name, json.loads(tc.function.arguments))
```

&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Sandbox Tool&lt;/summary&gt;


&gt; [Tool Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/tool/bash_tools) | [SDK Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/store/sandbox)
&gt;
&gt; Isolated code execution environment with bash, Python, and common tools.

```python
from acontext.agent.sandbox import SANDBOX_TOOLS
from openai import OpenAI

sandbox = client.sandboxes.create()
disk = client.disks.create()
ctx = SANDBOX_TOOLS.format_context(client, sandbox.sandbox_id, disk.id)

# Pass to LLM
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;,
    messages=[
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;You have sandbox access.\n\n{ctx.get_context_prompt()}&quot;},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Run a Python hello world script&quot;}
    ],
    tools=SANDBOX_TOOLS.to_openai_tool_schema()
)

# Execute tool calls
for tc in response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    result = SANDBOX_TOOLS.execute_tool(ctx, tc.function.name, json.loads(tc.function.arguments))
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Sandbox with Skills&lt;/summary&gt;



&gt; [Tool Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/tool/bash_tools#mounting-skills-in-sandbox) | [SDK Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/store/skill)
&gt;
&gt; Mount reusable Agent Skills into sandbox at `/skills/{name}/`. [Download xlsx skill](https://github.com/memodb-io/Acontext-Examples/raw/refs/heads/main/python/interactive-agent-skill/xlsx.zip).

```python
from acontext import FileUpload

# Upload a skill ZIP (e.g., xlsx.zip)
with open(&quot;web-artifacts-builder.zip&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:
    skill = client.skills.create(file=FileUpload(filename=&quot;xlsx.zip&quot;, content=f.read()))

# Mount into sandbox
ctx = SANDBOX_TOOLS.format_context(
    client, sandbox.sandbox_id, disk.id,
    mount_skills=[skill.id]  # Available at /skills/{skill.name}/
)

# Context prompt includes skill instructions
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;,
    messages=[
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;You have sandbox access.\n\n{ctx.get_context_prompt()}&quot;},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Create an Excel file with a simple budget spreadsheet and export it&quot;}
    ],
    tools=SANDBOX_TOOLS.to_openai_tool_schema()
)

# Execute tool calls
for tc in response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    result = SANDBOX_TOOLS.execute_tool(ctx, tc.function.name, json.loads(tc.function.arguments))
```

# SparkyFitness

A self-hosted, privacy-first alternative to MyFitnessPal. Track nutrition, exercise, body metrics, and health data while keeping full control of your data.


![Screenshot](docs/public/web_screenshot.png)


SparkyFitness is a self-hosted fitness tracking platform made up of:

- A backend server (API + data storage)
- A web-based frontend
- Native mobile apps for iOS and Android

It stores and manages health data on infrastructure you control, without relying on third party services.

## Core Features

- Nutrition, exercise, hydration, and body measurement tracking
- Goal setting and daily check-ins
- Interactive charts and long-term reports
- Multiple user profiles and family access
- Light and dark themes

## Health &amp; Device Integrations

SparkyFitness can sync data from multiple health and fitness platforms:

- **Apple Health** (iOS)
- **Google Health Connect** (Android)
- **Fitbit**
- **Garmin Connect**
- **Withings**

Integrations automatically sync activity data such as steps, workouts, and sleep, along with health metrics like weight and body measurements, to your SparkyFitness server.

## Optional AI Features (Beta)

SparkyAI provides a conversational interface for logging data and reviewing progress.

- Log food, exercise, body stats, and steps via chat
- Upload food images for automatic meal logging
- Retains conversation history for follow ups

Note: AI features are currently in beta.


## Quick Start (Server)

Get a SparkyFitness server running in minutes using Docker Compose.

```bash
# 1. Create a new folder
mkdir sparkyfitness &amp;&amp; cd sparkyfitness

# 2. Download Docker files only

Have you dreamed about having a cyber living being (cyber waifu, digital pet) or digital companion that could play with and talk to you?

With the power of modern large language models like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and famous [Claude](https://claude.ai), asking a virtual being to roleplay and chat with us is already easy enough for everyone. Platforms like [Character.ai (a.k.a. c.ai)](https://character.ai) and [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/) as well as local playgrounds like [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) are already good-enough solutions for a chat based or visual adventure game like experience.

&gt; But, what about the abilities to play games? And see what you are coding at? Chatting while playing games, watching videos, and is capable of doing many other things.

Perhaps you know [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama) already. She is currently the best virtual streamer capable of playing games, chatting, and interacting with you and the participants. Some also call this kind of being &quot;digital human.&quot; **Sadly, as it&#039;s not open sourced, you cannot interact with her after her live streams go offline**.

Therefore, this project, AIRI, offers another possibility here: **let you own your digital life, cyber living, easily, anywhere, anytime**.

## What&#039;s So Special About This Project?

Unlike the other AI driven VTuber open source projects, アイリ was built with support of many Web technologies such as [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/), [WebAudio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket), etc. from the first day.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Worrying about the performance drop since we are using Web related technologies?
&gt;
&gt; Don&#039;t worry, while Web browser version is meant to give an insight about how much we can push and do inside browsers, and webviews, we will never fully rely on this, the desktop version of AIRI is capable of using native [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [Apple Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) by default (thanks to HuggingFace &amp; beloved [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) project), without any complex dependency managements, considering the tradeoff, it was partially powered by Web technologies for graphics, layouts, animations, and the WIP plugin systems for everyone to integrate things.

This means that **アイリ is capable of running on modern browsers and devices** and even on mobile devices (already done with PWA support). This brings a lot of possibilities for us (the developers) to build and extend the power of アイリ VTuber to the next level, while still leaving the flexibilities for users to enable features that requires TCP connections or other non-Web technologies such as connecting to a Discord voice channel or playing Minecraft and Factorio with friends.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; We are still in the early stage of development where we are seeking out talented developers to join us and help us to make アイリ a reality.
&gt;
&gt; It&#039;s ok if you are not familiar with Vue.js, TypeScript, and devtools required for this project, you can join us as an artist, designer, or even help us to launch our first live stream.
&gt;
&gt; Even if you are a big fan of React, Svelte or even Solid, we welcome you. You can open a sub-directory to add features that you want to see in アイリ, or would like to experiment with.
&gt;
&gt; Fields (and related projects) that we are looking for:
&gt;
&gt; - Live2D modeller
&gt; - VRM modeller
&gt; - VRChat avatar designer
&gt; - Computer Vision
&gt; - Reinforcement Learning
&gt; - Speech Recognition
&gt; - Speech Synthesis
&gt; - ONNX Runtime
&gt; - Transformers.js
&gt; - vLLM
&gt; - WebGPU
&gt; - Three.js
&gt; - WebXR ([checkout the another project](https://github.com/moeru-ai/chat) we have under the @moeru-ai organization)
&gt;
&gt; **If you are interested, why not introduce yourself here? [Would like to join part of us to build AIRI?](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/discussions/33)**
