2025-09-05: VibeVoice is an open-source research framework intended to advance collaboration in the speech synthesis community. After release, we discovered instances where the tool was used in ways inconsistent with the stated intent. Since responsible use of AI is one of Microsoft’s guiding principles, we have disabled this repo until we are confident that out-of-scope use is no longer possible.


### Overview

VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating **expressive**, **long-form**, **multi-speaker** conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.

VibeVoice currently includes two model variants:

- **Long-form multi-speaker model**: Synthesizes conversational/single-speaker speech up to **90 minutes** with up to **4 distinct speakers**, surpassing the typical 1–2 speaker limits of many prior models.
- **[Realtime streaming TTS model](docs/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b.md)**: Produces initial audible speech in ~**300 ms** and supports **streaming text input** for single-speaker **real-time** speech generation; designed for low-latency generation.

A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a [next-token diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635) framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.

## Risks and limitations

While efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release).
Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.

English and Chinese only: Transcripts in languages other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs.

Non-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects.

Overlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.

We do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.

cuTile Python
=============

cuTile Python is a programming language for NVIDIA GPUs. The official documentation can be found
on [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cutile-python),
or built from source located in the [docs](docs/) folder.

Installing from PyPI
--------------------
cuTile Python is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) under the
[cuda-tile](https://pypi.org/project/cuda-tile/) package name and can be installed with `pip`:
```
pip install cuda-tile
```
Currently, the [CUDA Toolkit 13.1+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) is required
and needs to be installed separately.

Building from Source
--------------------
cuTile is written mostly in Python, but includes a C++ extension which needs to be built.
You will need:
- A C++17-capable compiler, such as GNU C++ or MSVC;
- CMake 3.18+;
- GNU Make on Linux or msbuild on Windows;
- Python 3.10+ with development headers (`venv` module is recommended but optional);
- [CUDA Toolkit 13.1+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

On an Ubuntu system, the first four dependencies can be installed with APT:
```
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake python3-dev python3-venv
```

The CMakeLists.txt script will also automatically download
the [DLPack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack) dependency from GitHub.
If you wish to disable this behavior and provide your own copy of DLPack,
set the `CUDA_TILE_CMAKE_DLPACK_PATH` environment variable to a local path
to the DLPack source tree.

Unless you are already using a Python virtual environment, it is recommended to create one
in order to avoid installing cuTile globally:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Once the build dependencies are in place, the simplest way to build cuTile is to install it
in editable mode by running the following command in the source root directory:

```
pip install -e .
```

This will create the `build` directory and invoke the CMake-based build process.
In editable mode, the compiled extension module will be placed in the build directory,
and then a symbolic link to it will be created in the source directory.
This makes sure that the `pip install -e .` command above is needed only once, and recompiling
the extension after making changes to the C++ code can be done with `make -C build`
which is much faster. This logic is defined in [setup.py](./setup.py).

Running Tests
-------------
cuTile uses the [pytest](https://pytest.org) framework for testing.
Tests have extra dependencies, such as PyTorch, which can be installed with
```
pip install -r test/requirements.txt
```

The tests are located in the [test/](test/) directory. To run a specific test file,
for example `test_copy.py`, use the following command:
```
pytest test/test_copy.py
```

不仅仅体现在报告质量上，相比同类产品，我们拥有🚀六大优势：

1. **AI驱动的全域监控**：AI爬虫集群7x24小时不间断作业，全面覆盖微博、小红书、抖音、快手等10+国内外关键社媒。不仅实时捕获热点内容，更能下钻至海量用户评论，让您听到最真实、最广泛的大众声音。

2. **超越LLM的复合分析引擎**：我们不仅依赖设计的5类专业Agent，更融合了微调模型、统计模型等中间件。通过多模型协同工作，确保了分析结果的深度、准度与多维视角。

3. **强大的多模态能力**：突破图文限制，能深度解析抖音、快手等短视频内容，并精准提取现代搜索引擎中的天气、日历、股票等结构化多模态信息卡片，让您全面掌握舆情动态。

4. **Agent“论坛”协作机制**：为不同Agent赋予独特的工具集与思维模式，引入辩论主持人模型，通过“论坛”机制进行链式思维碰撞与辩论。这不仅避免了单一模型的思维局限与交流导致的同质化，更催生出更高质量的集体智能与决策支持。

5. **公私域数据无缝融合**：平台不仅分析公开舆情，还提供高安全性的接口，支持您将内部业务数据库与舆情数据无缝集成。打通数据壁垒，为垂直业务提供“外部趋势+内部洞察”的强大分析能力。

6. **轻量化与高扩展性框架**：基于纯Python模块化设计，实现轻量化、一键式部署。代码结构清晰，开发者可轻松集成自定义模型与业务逻辑，实现平台的快速扩展与深度定制。

**始于舆情，而不止于舆情**。“微舆”的目标，是成为驱动一切业务场景的简洁通用的数据分析引擎。

&gt; 举个例子. 你只需简单修改Agent工具集的api参数与prompt，就可以把他变成一个金融领域的市场分析系统

## 🚀 快速开始（Docker）

### 1. 启动项目

复制一份 `.env.example` 文件，命名为 `.env` ，并按需配置 `.env` 文件中的环境变量

执行以下命令在后台启动所有服务：

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

&gt; **注：镜像拉取速度慢**，在原 `docker-compose.yml` 文件中，我们已经通过**注释**的方式提供了备用镜像地址供您替换

### 2. 配置说明

#### 数据库配置（PostgreSQL）

请按照以下参数配置数据库连接信息，也支持Mysql可自行修改：

| 配置项 | 填写值 | 说明 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DB_HOST` | `db` | 数据库服务名称 (对应 `docker-compose.yml` 中的服务名) |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | 默认 PostgreSQL 端口 |
| `DB_USER` | `bettafish` | 数据库用户名 |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `bettafish` | 数据库密码 |
| `DB_NAME` | `bettafish` | 数据库名称 |
| **其他** | **保持默认** | 数据库连接池等其他参数请保持默认设置。 |

#### 大模型配置

&gt; 我们所有 LLM 调用使用 OpenAI 的 API 接口标准

在完成数据库配置后，请正常配置**所有大模型相关的参数**，确保系统能够连接到您选择的大模型服务。

完成上述所有配置并保存后，系统即可正常运行。

## 🔧 源码启动指南

&gt; 如果你是初次学习一个Agent系统的搭建，可以从一个非常简单的demo开始：[Deep Search Agent Demo](https://github.com/666ghj/DeepSearchAgent-Demo)

### 环境要求

- **操作系统**: Windows、Linux、MacOS
- **Python版本**: 3.9+
- **Conda**: Anaconda或Miniconda
- **数据库**: PostgreSQL（推荐）或MySQL
- **内存**: 建议2GB以上

### 1. 创建环境

#### 如果使用Conda

```bash
# 创建conda环境
conda create -n your_conda_name python=3.11
conda activate your_conda_name
```

#### 如果使用uv

```bash
# 创建uv环境
uv venv --python 3.11 # 创建3.11环境
```

### 2. 安装 PDF 导出所需系统依赖（可选）

这部分有详细的配置说明：[配置所需依赖](./static/Partial%20README%20for%20PDF%20Exporting/README.md)

### 3. 安装依赖包

&gt; 如果跳过了步骤2，weasyprint库可能无法安装，PDF功能可能无法正常使用。

```bash
# 基础依赖安装
pip install -r requirements.txt

# uv版本命令（更快速安装）
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# 如果不想使用本地情感分析模型（算力需求很小，默认安装cpu版本），可以将该文件中的&quot;机器学习&quot;部分注释掉再执行指令
```

### 4. 安装Playwright浏览器驱动

```bash
# 安装浏览器驱动（用于爬虫功能）
playwright install chromium
```

### 5. 配置LLM与数据库

复制一份项目根目录 `.env.example` 文件，命名为 `.env`

编辑 `.env` 文件，填入您的API密钥（您也可以选择自己的模型、搜索代理，详情见根目录.env.example文件内或根目录config.py中的说明）：

```yml
# ====================== 数据库配置 ======================
# 数据库主机，例如localhost 或 127.0.0.1
DB_HOST=your_db_host
# 数据库端口号，默认为3306
DB_PORT=3306
# 数据库用户名
DB_USER=your_db_user
# 数据库密码
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
# 数据库名称
DB_NAME=your_db_name
# 数据库字符集，推荐utf8mb4，兼容emoji
DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
# 数据库类型postgresql或mysql
DB_DIALECT=postgresql
# 数据库不需要初始化，执行app.py时会自动检测

# ====================== LLM配置 ======================
# 您可以更改每个部分LLM使用的API，只要兼容OpenAI请求格式都可以
# 配置文件内部给了每一个Agent的推荐LLM，初次部署请先参考推荐设置

# Insight Agent
INSIGHT_ENGINE_API_KEY=
INSIGHT_ENGINE_BASE_URL=
INSIGHT_ENGINE_MODEL_NAME=

# Media Agent
...
```

### 6. 启动系统

#### 6.1 完整系统启动（推荐）

```bash
# 在项目根目录下，激活conda环境
conda activate your_conda_name

# 启动主应用即可
python app.py
```

uv 版本启动命令 
```bash
# 在项目根目录下，激活uv环境
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 启动主应用即可
python app.py
```

&gt; 注1：一次运行终止后，streamlit app可能结束异常仍然占用端口，此时搜索占用端口的进程kill掉即可

&gt; 注2：数据爬取需要单独操作，见6.3指引

访问 http://localhost:5000 即可使用完整系统

#### 6.2 单独启动某个Agent

```bash
# 启动QueryEngine
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/query_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8503

# 启动MediaEngine  
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/media_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502

# 启动InsightEngine
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/insight_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
```

#### 6.3 爬虫系统单独使用

这部分有详细的配置文档：[MindSpider使用说明](./MindSpider/README.md)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MindSpider\img\example.png&quot; alt=&quot;banner&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;

MindSpider 运行示例
&lt;/div&gt;

```bash
# 进入爬虫目录
cd MindSpider

# 项目初始化
python main.py --setup

# 运行话题提取（获取热点新闻和关键词）
python main.py --broad-topic

# 运行完整爬虫流程
python main.py --complete --date 2024-01-20

# 仅运行话题提取
python main.py --broad-topic --date 2024-01-20

# 仅运行深度爬取
python main.py --deep-sentiment --platforms xhs dy wb
```

#### 6.4 命令行报告生成工具

该工具会跳过三个分析引擎的运行阶段，直接读取它们的最新日志文件，并在无需 Web 界面的情况下生成综合报告（同时省略文件增量校验步骤）。通常用于对报告生成结果不满意、需要快速重试的场景，或在调试 Report Engine 时启用。

```bash
# 基本使用（自动从文件名提取主题）
python report_engine_only.py

# 指定报告主题
python report_engine_only.py --query &quot;土木工程行业分析&quot;

# 跳过PDF生成（即使系统支持）
python report_engine_only.py --skip-pdf

# 显示详细日志
python report_engine_only.py --verbose

# 查看帮助信息
python report_engine_only.py --help
```

**功能说明：**

1. **自动检查依赖**：程序会自动检查PDF生成所需的系统依赖，如果缺失会给出安装提示
2. **获取最新文件**：自动从三个引擎目录（`insight_engine_streamlit_reports`、`media_engine_streamlit_reports`、`query_engine_streamlit_reports`）获取最新的分析报告
3. **文件确认**：显示所有选择的文件名、路径和修改时间，等待用户确认（默认输入 `y` 继续，输入 `n` 退出）
4. **直接生成报告**：跳过文件增加审核程序，直接调用Report Engine生成综合报告
5. **自动保存文件**：
   - HTML报告保存到 `final_reports/` 目录
   - PDF报告（如果有依赖）保存到 `final_reports/pdf/` 目录
   - 文件命名格式：`final_report_{主题}_{时间戳}.html/pdf`

**注意事项：**

- 确保三个引擎目录中至少有一个包含`.md`报告文件
- 命令行工具与Web界面相互独立，不会相互影响
- PDF生成需要安装系统依赖，详见上文&quot;安装 PDF 导出所需系统依赖&quot;部分

## ⚙️ 高级配置（已过时，已经统一为项目根目录.env文件管理，其他子agent自动继承根目录配置）

### 修改关键参数

#### Agent配置参数

每个Agent都有专门的配置文件，可根据需求调整，下面是部分示例：

```python
# QueryEngine/utils/config.py
class Config:
    max_reflections = 2           # 反思轮次
    max_search_results = 15       # 最大搜索结果数
    max_content_length = 8000     # 最大内容长度
    
# MediaEngine/utils/config.py  
class Config:
    comprehensive_search_limit = 10  # 综合搜索限制
    web_search_limit = 15           # 网页搜索限制

Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it&#039;s possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it&#039;s not plug-and-play.


### Branches

Running `master` and other branches directly is supported, but it&#039;s recommended to run one of the following prebuilt branches:

| comma four branch      | comma 3X branch        | URL                                    | description                                                                         |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release-mici`         | `release-tizi`         | openpilot.comma.ai                     | This is openpilot&#039;s release branch.                                                 |
| `release-mici-staging` | `release-tizi-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`              | `nightly`              | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`          | `nightly-dev`          | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |

&lt;/div&gt;

## 🎬 Get Started

### 📝 Prerequisites

- CPU &gt;= 4 cores
- RAM &gt;= 16 GB
- Disk &gt;= 50 GB
- Docker &gt;= 24.0.0 &amp; Docker Compose &gt;= v2.26.1
- [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/): Required only if you intend to use the code executor (sandbox) feature of RAGFlow.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux), see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 🚀 Start up the server

1. Ensure `vm.max_map_count` &gt;= 262144:

   &gt; To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; $ sysctl vm.max_map_count
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; # In this case, we set it to 262144:
   &gt; $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the
   &gt; `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   ```
3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don&#039;t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.
&gt; If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.

&gt; The command below downloads the `v0.22.1` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.22.1`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server.

```bash
   $ cd ragflow/docker
  
   # git checkout v0.22.1
   # Optional: use a stable tag (see releases: https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/releases)
   # This step ensures the **entrypoint.sh** file in the code matches the Docker image version.
   
   # Use CPU for DeepDoc tasks:
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

   # To use GPU to accelerate DeepDoc tasks:
   # sed -i &#039;1i DEVICE=gpu&#039; .env
   # docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

&gt; Note: Prior to `v0.22.0`, we provided both images with embedding models and slim images without embedding models. Details as follows:

| RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?                  |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| v0.21.1           | &amp;approx;9       | ✔️                    | Stable release           |
| v0.21.1-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                    | Stable release           |

&gt; Starting with `v0.22.0`, we ship only the slim edition and no longer append the **-slim** suffix to the image tag.

4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:

   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f docker-ragflow-cpu-1
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ```bash

         ____   ___    ______ ______ __
        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __
       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /
      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /
     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/

    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
   ```

   &gt; If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network anormal`
   &gt; error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.
   &gt;
5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.

   &gt; With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default
   &gt; HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.
   &gt;
6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update
   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.

   &gt; See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.
   &gt;

   _The show is on!_

## 🔧 Configurations

When it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:

- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and
  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.
- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.

&gt; The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service
&gt; configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.

To update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`
to `&lt;YOUR_SERVING_PORT&gt;:80`.

Updates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:

&gt; ```bash
&gt; $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
&gt; ```

### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity

RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:

1. Stop all running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.

2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.
3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.

## 🔧 Build a Docker image

This image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

## 🔨 Launch service from source for development

1. Install `uv` and `pre-commit`, or skip this step if they are already installed:

   ```bash
   pipx install uv pre-commit
   ```
2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   cd ragflow/
   uv sync --python 3.12 # install RAGFlow dependent python modules
   uv run download_deps.py
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d
   ```

   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:

   ```
   127.0.0.1       es01 infinity mysql minio redis sandbox-executor-manager
   ```
4. If you cannot access HuggingFace, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to use a mirror site:

   ```bash
   export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   ```
5. If your operating system does not have jemalloc, please install it as follows:

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libjemalloc-dev
   # CentOS
   sudo yum install jemalloc
   # OpenSUSE
   sudo zypper install jemalloc
   # macOS
   sudo brew install jemalloc
   ```
6. Launch backend service:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
   bash docker/launch_backend_service.sh
   ```
7. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```
8. Launch frontend service:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0daf462c-a24d-4496-a66f-92533534e187)
9. Stop RAGFlow front-end and back-end service after development is complete:

   ```bash
   pkill -f &quot;ragflow_server.py|task_executor.py&quot;
   ```

## How to Install

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you&#039;ll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

**Financial Data**: Data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## How to Run

### ⌨️ Command Line Interface

You can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

&lt;img width=&quot;992&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b&quot; /&gt;

#### Quick Start

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the AI Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

#### Run the Backtester
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**
&lt;img width=&quot;941&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 47 52 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e794ea-8628-44e6-9a84-8f8a31ad3b47&quot; /&gt;


Note: The `--ollama`, `--start-date`, and `--end-date` flags work for the backtester, as well!

### 🖥️ Web Application

The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. This is recommended for users who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.

Please see detailed instructions on how to install and run the web application [here](https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund/tree/main/app).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TotalSegmentator

Tool for segmentation of most major anatomical structures in any CT or MR image. It was trained on a wide range of different CT and MR images (different scanners, institutions, protocols,...) and therefore works well on most images. A large part of the training dataset can be downloaded here: [CT dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802613) (1228 subjects) and [MR dataset](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11367004) (616 subjects). You can also try the tool online at [totalsegmentator.com](https://totalsegmentator.com/) or as [3D Slicer extension](https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerTotalSegmentator).

**ANNOUNCEMENT: We created a platform where anyone can help annotate more data to further improve TotalSegmentator: [TotalSegmentator Annotation Platform](https://annotate.totalsegmentator.com).**  
  
**ANNOUNCEMENT: We created web applications for [abdominal organ volume](https://compute.totalsegmentator.com/volume-report/), [Evans index](https://compute.totalsegmentator.com/evans-index/), and [aorta diameter](https://compute.totalsegmentator.com/aorta-report/).**

Main classes for CT and MR:
![Alt text](resources/imgs/overview_classes_v2.png)

TotalSegmentator supports a lot more structures. See [subtasks](#subtasks) or [here](https://backend.totalsegmentator.com/find-task/) for more details.

### Installation

TotalSegmentator works on Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows and on CPU and GPU.

Install dependencies:
* Python &gt;= 3.9
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) &gt;= 2.0.0

Optionally:
* if you use the option `--preview` you have to install xvfb (`apt-get install xvfb`) and fury (`pip install fury`)


Install Totalsegmentator
```bash
pip install TotalSegmentator
```


### Usage
For CT images:
```bash
TotalSegmentator -i ct.nii.gz -o segmentations
```
For MR images:
```bash
TotalSegmentator -i mri.nii.gz -o segmentations --task total_mr
```
&gt; Note: A Nifti file or a folder (or zip file) with all DICOM slices of one patient is allowed as input.

&gt; Note: If you run on CPU use the option `--fast` or `--roi_subset` to greatly improve runtime.

&gt; Note: This is not a medical device and is not intended for clinical usage. However, it is part of several FDA-approved products, where it has been certified as a component of the overall system.

Confused by all the structures and tasks? Check [this](https://backend.totalsegmentator.com/find-task/) to search through available structures and tasks.

The mapping from label ID to class name can be found [here](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/blob/master/totalsegmentator/map_to_binary.py).

If you have a nnU-Net model for some structures not supported yet, you can contribute it. This will enable all TotalSegmentator users to easily use it and at the same time increase the reach of your work by more people citing your paper. Contact jakob.wasserthal@usb.ch.

Thank you to [INGEDATA](https://www.ingedata.ai/) for providing a team of radiologists to support some of the data annotations.


### Advanced settings
* `--device`: Choose `cpu` or `gpu` or `gpu:X (e.g., gpu:1 -&gt; cuda:1)`
* `--fast`: For faster runtime and less memory requirements use this option. It will run a lower resolution model (3mm instead of 1.5mm).
* `--roi_subset`: Takes a space-separated list of class names (e.g. `spleen colon brain`) and only predicts those classes. Saves a lot of runtime and memory. Might be less accurate especially for small classes (e.g. prostate).
* `--robust_crop`: For some tasks and for roi_subset a 6mm low resolution model is used to crop to the region of interest. Sometimes this model is incorrect, which leads to artifacts like segmentations being cut off. robust_crop will use a better but slower 3mm model instead.
* `--preview`: This will generate a 3D rendering of all classes, giving you a quick overview if the segmentation worked and where it failed (see `preview.png` in output directory).
* `--ml`: This will save one nifti file containing all labels instead of one file for each class. Saves runtime during saving of nifti files. (see [here](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator#class-details) for index to class name mapping).
* `--statistics`: This will generate a file `statistics.json` with volume (in mm³) and mean intensity of each class.
* `--radiomics`: This will generate a file `statistics_radiomics.json` with the radiomics features of each class. You have to install pyradiomics to use this (`pip install pyradiomics`).
* `--output_type`: This will output the segmentation as DICOM. Supported are `dicom_seg` requires (`pip install highdicom`) and `dicom_rtstruct` requires (`pip install rt_utils`).


### Other commands
If you want to know which contrast phase a CT image is you can use the following command (requires `pip install xgboost`). More details can be found [here](resources/contrast_phase_prediction.md):
```bash
totalseg_get_phase -i ct.nii.gz -o contrast_phase.json
```

If you want to know which modality (CT or MR) an image is you can use the following command (requires `pip install xgboost`). 
```bash
totalseg_get_modality -i image.nii.gz -o modality.json
```

If you want to combine some subclasses (e.g. lung lobes) into one binary mask (e.g. entire lung) you can use the following command:
```bash
totalseg_combine_masks -i totalsegmentator_output_dir -o combined_mask.nii.gz -m lungcomm 
```

If you want to calculate the [Evans index](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/evans-index-2) you can use the following command:
```bash
totalseg_evans_index -i ct_skull.nii.gz -o evans_index.json -p evans_index.png
```

Normally weights are automatically downloaded when running TotalSegmentator. If you want to download the weights with an extra command (e.g. when building a docker container) use this:
```bash
totalseg_download_weights -t &lt;task_name&gt;
```
This will download them to `~/.totalsegmentator/nnunet/results`. You can change this path by doing `export TOTALSEG_HOME_DIR=/new/path/.totalsegmentator`. If your machine has no internet, then download on another machine with internet and copy `~/.totalsegmentator` to the machine without internet.

After acquiring a license number for the non-open tasks you can set it with the following command:
```bash
totalseg_set_license -l aca_12345678910
```

You can output the softmax probabilities. This will give you a `.npz` file you can load with numpy. The geometry
might not be identical to your input image. There will also be a `.pkl` output file with geometry
information. This does not work well for the `total` task since this is based on multiple models.
```bash
TotalSegmentator -i ct.nii.gz -o seg -ta lung_nodules --save_probabilities probs.npz
```

If you do not have internet access on the machine you want to run TotalSegmentator on:
1. Install TotalSegmentator [and set up the license] on a machine with internet.
2. Run TotalSegmentator for one subject on this machine. This will download the weights and save them to `~/.totalsegmentator`.
3. Copy the folder `~/.totalsegmentator` from this machine to the machine without internet.
4. TotalSegmentator should now work also on the machine without internet.


### Web applications
We provide the following web applications to easily process your images:
* [TotalSegmentator](https://totalsegmentator.com/): Run totalsegmentator on your own images via a simple web interface.
* [TotalSegmentator Annotation Platform](https://annotate.totalsegmentator.com/): Help annotate more data to further improve TotalSegmentator.
* [Volume Report](https://compute.totalsegmentator.com/volume-report/): Get the volume of abdominal organs + tissue und bone density. Also show percentile in population.
* [Evans Index](https://compute.totalsegmentator.com/evans-index/): Compute the Evans index.
* [Aorta Report](https://compute.totalsegmentator.com/aorta-report/): Analyse the diameter along the aorta.


### Run via docker
We also provide a docker container which can be used the following way
```bash
docker run --gpus &#039;device=0&#039; --shm-size=16G -v /absolute/path/to/my/data/directory:/tmp wasserth/totalsegmentator:2.11.0 TotalSegmentator -i /tmp/ct.nii.gz -o /tmp/segmentations
```


### Resource Requirements
Totalsegmentator has the following runtime and memory requirements (using an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU):
(1.5mm is the normal model and 3mm is the `--fast` model. With v2 the runtimes have increased a bit since
we added more classes.)

&lt;hr&gt;

🙌 Welcome to OpenHands, a [community](COMMUNITY.md) focused on AI-driven development. We’d love for you to [join us on Slack](https://dub.sh/openhands).

There are a few ways to work with OpenHands:

### OpenHands Software Agent SDK
The SDK is a composable Python library that contains all of our agentic tech. It&#039;s the engine that powers everything else below.

Define agents in code, then run them locally, or scale to 1000s of agents in the cloud.

[Check out the docs](https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk) or [view the source](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/)

### OpenHands CLI
The CLI is the easiest way to start using OpenHands. The experience will be familiar to anyone who has worked
with e.g. Claude Code or Codex. You can power it with Claude, GPT, or any other LLM.

[Check out the docs](https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/run-openhands/cli-mode) or [view the source](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI)

### OpenHands Local GUI
Use the Local GUI for running agents on your laptop. It comes with a REST API and a single-page React application.
The experience will be familiar to anyone who has used Devin or Jules.

[Check out the docs](https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/run-openhands/local-setup) or view the source in this repo.

### OpenHands Cloud
This is a deployment of OpenHands GUI, running on hosted infrastructure.

You can try it with a free $10 credit by [signing in with your GitHub account](https://app.all-hands.dev).

OpenHands Cloud comes with source-available features and integrations:
- Integrations with Slack, Jira, and Linear
- Multi-user support
- RBAC and permissions
- Collaboration features (e.g., conversation sharing)

### OpenHands Enterprise
Large enterprises can work with us to self-host OpenHands Cloud in their own VPC, via Kubernetes.
OpenHands Enterprise can also work with the CLI and SDK above.

OpenHands Enterprise is source-available--you can see all the source code here in the enterprise/ directory,
but you&#039;ll need to purchase a license if you want to run it for more than one month.

Enterprise contracts also come with extended support and access to our research team.

Learn more at [openhands.dev/enterprise](https://openhands.dev/enterprise)

### Everything Else

Check out our [Product Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/openhands/projects/1), and feel free to
[open up an issue](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/issues) if there&#039;s something you&#039;d like to see!

You might also be interested in our [evaluation infrastructure](https://github.com/OpenHands/benchmarks), our [chrome extension](https://github.com/OpenHands/openhands-chrome-extension/), or our [Theory-of-Mind module](https://github.com/OpenHands/ToM-SWE).

All our work is available under the MIT license, except for the `enterprise/` directory in this repository (see the [enterprise license](enterprise/LICENSE) for details).
The core `openhands` and `agent-server` Docker images are fully MIT-licensed as well.

If you need help with anything, or just want to chat, [come find us on Slack](https://dub.sh/openhands).

## 🆕 Now with CLI-to-CLI Bridge

The new **[`clink`](docs/tools/clink.md)** (CLI + Link) tool connects external AI CLIs directly into your workflow:

- **Connect external CLIs** like [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) directly into your workflow
- **CLI Subagents** - Launch isolated CLI instances from _within_ your current CLI! Claude Code can spawn Codex subagents, Codex can spawn Gemini CLI subagents, etc. Offload heavy tasks (code reviews, bug hunting) to fresh contexts while your main session&#039;s context window remains unpolluted. Each subagent returns only final results.
- **Context Isolation** - Run separate investigations without polluting your primary workspace
- **Role Specialization** - Spawn `planner`, `codereviewer`, or custom role agents with specialized system prompts
- **Full CLI Capabilities** - Web search, file inspection, MCP tool access, latest documentation lookups
- **Seamless Continuity** - Sub-CLIs participate as first-class members with full conversation context between tools

```bash
# Codex spawns Codex subagent for isolated code review in fresh context
clink with codex codereviewer to audit auth module for security issues
# Subagent reviews in isolation, returns final report without cluttering your context as codex reads each file and walks the directory structure

# Consensus from different AI models → Implementation handoff with full context preservation between tools
Use consensus with gpt-5 and gemini-pro to decide: dark mode or offline support next
Continue with clink gemini - implement the recommended feature
# Gemini receives full debate context and starts coding immediately
```

## Why PAL MCP?

**Why rely on one AI model when you can orchestrate them all?**

A Model Context Protocol server that supercharges tools like [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), and IDE clients such
as [Cursor](https://cursor.com) or the [Claude Dev VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Anthropic.claude-vscode). **PAL MCP connects your favorite AI tool
to multiple AI models** for enhanced code analysis, problem-solving, and collaborative development.

### True AI Collaboration with Conversation Continuity

PAL supports **conversation threading** so your CLI can **discuss ideas with multiple AI models, exchange reasoning, get second opinions, and even run collaborative debates between models** to help you reach deeper insights and better solutions.

Your CLI always stays in control but gets perspectives from the best AI for each subtask. Context carries forward seamlessly across tools and models, enabling complex workflows like: code reviews with multiple models → automated planning → implementation → pre-commit validation.

&gt; **You&#039;re in control.** Your CLI of choice orchestrates the AI team, but you decide the workflow. Craft powerful prompts that bring in Gemini Pro, GPT 5, Flash, or local offline models exactly when needed.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reasons to Use PAL MCP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

A typical workflow with Claude Code as an example:

1. **Multi-Model Orchestration** - Claude coordinates with Gemini Pro, O3, GPT-5, and 50+ other models to get the best analysis for each task

2. **Context Revival Magic** - Even after Claude&#039;s context resets, continue conversations seamlessly by having other models &quot;remind&quot; Claude of the discussion

3. **Guided Workflows** - Enforces systematic investigation phases that prevent rushed analysis and ensure thorough code examination

4. **Extended Context Windows** - Break Claude&#039;s limits by delegating to Gemini (1M tokens) or O3 (200K tokens) for massive codebases

5. **True Conversation Continuity** - Full context flows across tools and models - Gemini remembers what O3 said 10 steps ago

6. **Model-Specific Strengths** - Extended thinking with Gemini Pro, blazing speed with Flash, strong reasoning with O3, privacy with local Ollama

7. **Professional Code Reviews** - Multi-pass analysis with severity levels, actionable feedback, and consensus from multiple AI experts

8. **Smart Debugging Assistant** - Systematic root cause analysis with hypothesis tracking and confidence levels

9. **Automatic Model Selection** - Claude intelligently picks the right model for each subtask (or you can specify)

10. **Vision Capabilities** - Analyze screenshots, diagrams, and visual content with vision-enabled models

11. **Local Model Support** - Run Llama, Mistral, or other models locally for complete privacy and zero API costs

12. **Bypass MCP Token Limits** - Automatically works around MCP&#039;s 25K limit for large prompts and responses

**The Killer Feature:** When Claude&#039;s context resets, just ask to &quot;continue with O3&quot; - the other model&#039;s response magically revives Claude&#039;s understanding without re-ingesting documents!

#### Example: Multi-Model Code Review Workflow

1. `Perform a codereview using gemini pro and o3 and use planner to generate a detailed plan, implement the fixes and do a final precommit check by continuing from the previous codereview`
2. This triggers a [`codereview`](docs/tools/codereview.md) workflow where Claude walks the code, looking for all kinds of issues
3. After multiple passes, collects relevant code and makes note of issues along the way
4. Maintains a `confidence` level between `exploring`, `low`, `medium`, `high` and `certain` to track how confidently it&#039;s been able to find and identify issues
5. Generates a detailed list of critical -&gt; low issues
6. Shares the relevant files, findings, etc with **Gemini Pro** to perform a deep dive for a second [`codereview`](docs/tools/codereview.md)
7. Comes back with a response and next does the same with o3, adding to the prompt if a new discovery comes to light
8. When done, Claude takes in all the feedback and combines a single list of all critical -&gt; low issues, including good patterns in your code. The final list includes new findings or revisions in case Claude misunderstood or missed something crucial and one of the other models pointed this out
9. It then uses the [`planner`](docs/tools/planner.md) workflow to break the work down into simpler steps if a major refactor is required
10. Claude then performs the actual work of fixing highlighted issues
11. When done, Claude returns to Gemini Pro for a [`precommit`](docs/tools/precommit.md) review

All within a single conversation thread! Gemini Pro in step 11 _knows_ what was recommended by O3 in step 7! Taking that context
and review into consideration to aid with its final pre-commit review.

**Think of it as Claude Code _for_ Claude Code.** This MCP isn&#039;t magic. It&#039;s just **super-glue**.

&gt; **Remember:** Claude stays in full control — but **YOU** call the shots.
&gt; PAL is designed to have Claude engage other models only when needed — and to follow through with meaningful back-and-forth.
&gt; **You&#039;re** the one who crafts the powerful prompt that makes Claude bring in Gemini, Flash, O3 — or fly solo.
&gt; You&#039;re the guide. The prompter. The puppeteer.
&gt; #### You are the AI - **Actually Intelligent**.
&lt;/details&gt;

### Enabling Additional Tools

To enable additional tools, remove them from the `DISABLED_TOOLS` list:

**Option 1: Edit your .env file**
```bash
# Default configuration (from .env.example)
DISABLED_TOOLS=analyze,refactor,testgen,secaudit,docgen,tracer

# To enable specific tools, remove them from the list
# Example: Enable analyze tool
DISABLED_TOOLS=refactor,testgen,secaudit,docgen,tracer

# To enable ALL tools
DISABLED_TOOLS=
```

**Option 2: Configure in MCP settings**
```json
// In ~/.claude/settings.json or .mcp.json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;pal&quot;: {
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        // Tool configuration
        &quot;DISABLED_TOOLS&quot;: &quot;refactor,testgen,secaudit,docgen,tracer&quot;,

## Introduction

Welcome to the magical world of Diffusion models! DiffSynth-Studio is an open-source Diffusion model engine developed and maintained by the [ModelScope Community](https://www.modelscope.cn/). We hope to foster technological innovation through framework construction, aggregate the power of the open-source community, and explore the boundaries of generative model technology!

DiffSynth currently includes two open-source projects:
* [DiffSynth-Studio](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio): Focused on aggressive technical exploration, targeting academia, and providing cutting-edge model capability support.
* [DiffSynth-Engine](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Engine): Focused on stable model deployment, targeting industry, and providing higher computational performance and more stable features.

[DiffSynth-Studio](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio) and [DiffSynth-Engine](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Engine) are the core engines of the ModelScope AIGC zone. Welcome to experience our carefully crafted productized features:

* ModelScope AIGC Zone (for Chinese users): https://modelscope.cn/aigc/home
* ModelScope Civision (for global users): https://modelscope.ai/civision/home

&gt; DiffSynth-Studio Documentation: [中文版](/docs/zh/README.md)、[English version](/docs/en/README.md)

We believe that a well-developed open-source code framework can lower the threshold for technical exploration. We have achieved many [interesting technologies](#innovative-achievements) based on this codebase. Perhaps you also have many wild ideas, and with DiffSynth-Studio, you can quickly realize these ideas. For this reason, we have prepared detailed documentation for developers. We hope that through these documents, developers can understand the principles of Diffusion models, and we look forward to expanding the boundaries of technology together with you.

## Update History

&gt; DiffSynth-Studio has undergone major version updates, and some old features are no longer maintained. If you need to use old features, please switch to the [last historical version](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio/tree/afd101f3452c9ecae0c87b79adfa2e22d65ffdc3) before the major version update.

&gt; Currently, the development personnel of this project are limited, with most of the work handled by [Artiprocher](https://github.com/Artiprocher). Therefore, the progress of new feature development will be relatively slow, and the speed of responding to and resolving issues is limited. We apologize for this and ask developers to understand.

- **December 9, 2025** We release a wild model based on DiffSynth-Studio 2.0: [Qwen-Image-i2L](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/DiffSynth-Studio/Qwen-Image-i2L) (Image-to-LoRA). This model takes an image as input and outputs a LoRA. Although this version still has significant room for improvement in terms of generalization, detail preservation, and other aspects, we are open-sourcing these models to inspire more innovative research.

- **December 4, 2025** DiffSynth-Studio 2.0 released! Many new features online
  - [Documentation](/docs/en/README.md) online: Our documentation is still continuously being optimized and updated
  - [VRAM Management](/docs/en/Pipeline_Usage/VRAM_management.md) module upgraded, supporting layer-level disk offload, releasing both memory and VRAM simultaneously
  - New model support
    - Z-Image Turbo: [Model](https://www.modelscope.ai/models/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo), [Documentation](/docs/en/Model_Details/Z-Image.md), [Code](/examples/z_image/)
    - FLUX.2-dev: [Model](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev), [Documentation](/docs/en/Model_Details/FLUX2.md), [Code](/examples/flux2/)
  - Training framework upgrade
    - [Split Training](/docs/zh/Training/Split_Training.md): Supports automatically splitting the training process into two stages: data processing and training (even for training ControlNet or any other model). Computations that do not require gradient backpropagation, such as text encoding and VAE encoding, are performed during the data processing stage, while other computations are handled during the training stage. Faster speed, less VRAM requirement.
    - [Differential LoRA Training](/docs/zh/Training/Differential_LoRA.md): This is a training technique we used in [ArtAug](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/DiffSynth-Studio/ArtAug-lora-FLUX.1dev-v1), now available for LoRA training of any model.
    - [FP8 Training](/docs/zh/Training/FP8_Precision.md): FP8 can be applied to any non-training model during training, i.e., models with gradients turned off or gradients that only affect LoRA weights.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;More&lt;/summary&gt;

- **December 18, 2024** We propose ArtAug, a method to improve text-to-image models through synthesis-understanding interaction. We trained an ArtAug enhancement module for FLUX.1-dev in LoRA format. This model incorporates the aesthetic understanding of Qwen2-VL-72B into FLUX.1-dev, thereby improving the quality of generated images.

- **October 25, 2024** We provide extensive FLUX ControlNet support. This project supports many different ControlNet models and can be freely combined, even if their structures are different. Additionally, ControlNet models are compatible with high-resolution optimization and partition control technologies, enabling very powerful controllable image generation. See [`./examples/ControlNet/`](./examples/ControlNet/).

- **October 8, 2024** We released extended LoRAs based on CogVideoX-5B and ExVideo. You can download this model from [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/ECNU-CILab/ExVideo-CogVideoX-LoRA-129f-v1) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ECNU-CILab/ExVideo-CogVideoX-LoRA-129f-v1).

- **August 22, 2024** This project now supports CogVideoX-5B. See [here](/examples/video_synthesis/). We provide several interesting features for this text-to-video model, including:
  - Text-to-video
  - Video editing
  - Self super-resolution
  - Video interpolation

- **August 22, 2024** We implemented an interesting brush feature that supports all text-to-image models. Now you can create stunning images with the assistance of AI using the brush!
  - Use it in our [WebUI](#usage-in-webui).

- **August 21, 2024** DiffSynth-Studio now supports FLUX.
  - Enable CFG and high-resolution inpainting to improve visual quality. See [here](/examples/image_synthesis/README.md)
  - LoRA, ControlNet, and other addon models will be released soon.

- **June 21, 2024** We propose ExVideo, a post-training fine-tuning technique aimed at enhancing the capabilities of video generation models. We extended Stable Video Diffusion to achieve long video generation of up to 128 frames.
