            <h2>README</h2><pre># AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Aswath Damodaran Agent - The Dean of Valuation, focuses on story, numbers, and disciplined valuation
2. Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
3. Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investor, takes bold positions and pushes for change
4. Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
5. Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett&#039;s partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
6. Michael Burry Agent - The Big Short contrarian who hunts for deep value
7. Mohnish Pabrai Agent - The Dhandho investor, who looks for doubles at low risk
8. Peter Lynch Agent - Practical investor who seeks &quot;ten-baggers&quot; in everyday businesses
9. Phil Fisher Agent - Meticulous growth investor who uses deep &quot;scuttlebutt&quot; research 
10. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Agent - The Big Bull of India
11. Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential
12. Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
13. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
14. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
15. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
16. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
17. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
18. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## How to Install

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you&#039;ll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

**Financial Data**: Data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## How to Run

### ⌨️ Command Line Interface

You can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

&lt;img width=&quot;992&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b&quot; /&gt;

#### Quick Start

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the AI Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

#### Run the Backtester
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**
&lt;img width=&quot;941&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 47 52 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e794ea-8628-44e6-9a84-8f8a31ad3b47&quot; /&gt;


Note: The `--ollama`, `--start-date`, and `--end-date` flags work for the backtester, as well!

### 🖥️ Web Application

The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. This is recommended for users who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.

Please see detailed instructions on how to install and run the web application [here](https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund/tree/main/app).

# Letta (formerly MemGPT)

Letta is the platform for building stateful agents: open AI with advanced memory that can learn and self-improve over time.

* [**Quickstart**](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart): Build your first stateful agent in 5 minutes using Python or TypeScript
* [**Understanding agent memory**](https://docs.letta.com/core-concepts): Learn about memory blocks, tools, and how Letta agents maintain state
* [**Examples and tutorials**](https://docs.letta.com/tutorials/): Working code examples for common use cases and agent patterns
* [**API reference**](https://docs.letta.com/api): Complete REST API and SDK documentation for Python and TypeScript

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **Letta Code** is a memory-first coding harness, built on top of the Letta API. Instead of working in independent sessions, you work with a persisted agent that learns over time and is portable across models. You can use Letta Code to interact with any Letta agent via the CLI.
&gt; 
&gt; Read more about how to use Letta Code on the [official docs page](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code), or on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-code).

## Get started with the Letta API

Use the Letta API to build stateful agents that remember, learn, and improve over time. Letta allows you to build agents on any model provider, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and more.

### Installation

TypeScript / Node.js:
```bash
npm install @letta-ai/letta-client
```

Python:
```bash
pip install letta-client
```

### Hello World example

Below is a quick example of creating a stateful agent and sending it a message.
See the full [quickstart guide](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart) for complete documentation.

Running the examples require a [Letta Developer Platform](https://app.letta.com) account, or a [self-hosted Letta server](https://docs.letta.com/guides/selfhosting/).

TypeScript:
```typescript
import Letta from &quot;@letta-ai/letta-client&quot;;

const client = new Letta({ apiKey: process.env.LETTA_API_KEY });

// Create your agent
const agentState = await client.agents.create({
  model: &quot;openai/gpt-4.1&quot;,
  embedding: &quot;openai/text-embedding-3-small&quot;,
  memory_blocks: [
    {
      label: &quot;human&quot;,
      value:
        &quot;Name: Timber. Status: dog. Occupation: building Letta, infrastructure to democratize self-improving superintelligence&quot;,
    },
    {
      label: &quot;persona&quot;,
      value:
        &quot;I am a self-improving superintelligence. Timber is my best friend and collaborator.&quot;,
    },
  ],
  tools: [&quot;web_search&quot;, &quot;run_code&quot;],
});

console.log(&quot;Agent created with ID:&quot;, agentState.id);

// Send your agent a message
const response = await client.agents.messages.create(agentState.id, {
  input: &quot;What do you know about me?&quot;,
});

for (const message of response.messages) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

Python:
```python
from letta_client import Letta
import os

client = Letta(api_key=os.getenv(&quot;LETTA_API_KEY&quot;))

# Create your agent
agent_state = client.agents.create(
    model=&quot;openai/gpt-4.1&quot;,
    embedding=&quot;openai/text-embedding-3-small&quot;,
    memory_blocks=[
        {
          &quot;label&quot;: &quot;human&quot;,
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Name: Timber. Status: dog. Occupation: building Letta, infrastructure to democratize self-improving superintelligence&quot;
        },
        {
          &quot;label&quot;: &quot;persona&quot;,
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;I am a self-improving superintelligence. Timber is my best friend and collaborator.&quot;
        }
    ],
    tools=[&quot;web_search&quot;, &quot;run_code&quot;]
)

print(f&quot;Agent created with ID: {agent_state.id}&quot;)

# Send your agent a message
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent_state.id,
    input=&quot;What do you know about me?&quot;
)

for message in response.messages:
    print(message)
```

_Made with ♥️ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://resemble.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;resemble-logo-horizontal&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35cf756b-3506-4943-9c72-c05ddfa4e525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

**Chatterbox** is a family of three state-of-the-art, open-source text-to-speech models by Resemble AI.

We are excited to introduce **Chatterbox-Turbo**, our most efficient model yet. Built on a streamlined 350M parameter architecture, **Turbo** delivers high-quality speech with less compute and VRAM than our previous models. We have also distilled the speech-token-to-mel decoder, previously a bottleneck, reducing generation from 10 steps to just **one**, while retaining high-fidelity audio output.

**Paralinguistic tags** are now native to the Turbo model, allowing you to use `[cough]`, `[laugh]`, `[chuckle]`, and more to add distinct realism. While Turbo was built primarily for low-latency voice agents, it excels at narration and creative workflows.

## Usage

##### Chatterbox-Turbo

```python
import torchaudio as ta
import torch
from chatterbox.tts_turbo import ChatterboxTurboTTS

# Load the Turbo model
model = ChatterboxTurboTTS.from_pretrained(device=&quot;cuda&quot;)

# Generate with Paralinguistic Tags
text = &quot;Hi there, Sarah here from MochaFone calling you back [chuckle], have you got one minute to chat about the billing issue?&quot;

# Generate audio (requires a reference clip for voice cloning)
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=&quot;your_10s_ref_clip.wav&quot;)

ta.save(&quot;test-turbo.wav&quot;, wav, model.sr)
```

##### Chatterbox and Chatterbox-Multilingual

```python

import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
from chatterbox.mtl_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS

# English example
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device=&quot;cuda&quot;)

text = &quot;Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy&#039;s Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill.&quot;
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save(&quot;test-english.wav&quot;, wav, model.sr)

# Multilingual examples
multilingual_model = ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from_pretrained(device=device)

french_text = &quot;Bonjour, comment ça va? Ceci est le modèle de synthèse vocale multilingue Chatterbox, il prend en charge 23 langues.&quot;
wav_french = multilingual_model.generate(spanish_text, language_id=&quot;fr&quot;)
ta.save(&quot;test-french.wav&quot;, wav_french, model.sr)

chinese_text = &quot;你好，今天天气真不错，希望你有一个愉快的周末。&quot;
wav_chinese = multilingual_model.generate(chinese_text, language_id=&quot;zh&quot;)
ta.save(&quot;test-chinese.wav&quot;, wav_chinese, model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH = &quot;YOUR_FILE.wav&quot;
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save(&quot;test-2.wav&quot;, wav, model.sr)
```
See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

## Supported Languages 
Arabic (ar) • Danish (da) • German (de) • Greek (el) • English (en) • Spanish (es) • Finnish (fi) • French (fr) • Hebrew (he) • Hindi (hi) • Italian (it) • Japanese (ja) • Korean (ko) • Malay (ms) • Dutch (nl) • Norwegian (no) • Polish (pl) • Portuguese (pt) • Russian (ru) • Swedish (sv) • Swahili (sw) • Turkish (tr) • Chinese (zh)

## Original Chatterbox Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip’s language. To mitigate this, set `cfg_weight` to `0`.
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts across all languages.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


## Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI&#039;s Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.


## Watermark extraction

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

```python
import perth
import librosa

AUDIO_PATH = &quot;YOUR_FILE.wav&quot;

# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked_audio, sr = librosa.load(AUDIO_PATH, sr=None)

# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker = perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

# Extract watermark
watermark = watermarker.get_watermark(watermarked_audio, sample_rate=sr)
print(f&quot;Extracted watermark: {watermark}&quot;)
# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
```

Optionally, you can unzip `ttsfrd` resource and install `ttsfrd` package for better text normalization performance.

Notice that this step is not necessary. If you do not install `ttsfrd` package, we will use wetext by default.

``` sh
cd pretrained_models/CosyVoice-ttsfrd/
unzip resource.zip -d .
pip install ttsfrd_dependency-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
pip install ttsfrd-0.4.2-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Basic Usage

We strongly recommend using `Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B` for better performance.
Follow the code in `example.py` for detailed usage of each model.
```sh
python example.py
```

#### CosyVoice2 vllm Usage
If you want to use vllm for inference, please install `vllm==v0.9.0`. Older vllm version do not support CosyVoice2 inference.

Notice that `vllm==v0.9.0` has a lot of specific requirements, for example `torch==2.7.0`. You can create a new env to in case your hardward do not support vllm and old env is corrupted.

``` sh
conda create -n cosyvoice_vllm --clone cosyvoice
conda activate cosyvoice_vllm
pip install vllm==v0.9.0 transformers==4.51.3 numpy==1.26.4 -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host=mirrors.aliyun.com
python vllm_example.py
```

#### Start web demo

You can use our web demo page to get familiar with CosyVoice quickly.

Please see the demo website for details.

``` python
# change iic/CosyVoice-300M-SFT for sft inference, or iic/CosyVoice-300M-Instruct for instruct inference
python3 webui.py --port 50000 --model_dir pretrained_models/CosyVoice-300M
```

#### Advanced Usage

For advanced users, we have provided training and inference scripts in `examples/libritts/cosyvoice/run.sh`.

#### Build for deployment

Optionally, if you want service deployment,
You can run the following steps.

``` sh
cd runtime/python
docker build -t cosyvoice:v1.0 .
# change iic/CosyVoice-300M to iic/CosyVoice-300M-Instruct if you want to use instruct inference
# for grpc usage
docker run -d --runtime=nvidia -p 50000:50000 cosyvoice:v1.0 /bin/bash -c &quot;cd /opt/CosyVoice/CosyVoice/runtime/python/grpc &amp;&amp; python3 server.py --port 50000 --max_conc 4 --model_dir iic/CosyVoice-300M &amp;&amp; sleep infinity&quot;
cd grpc &amp;&amp; python3 client.py --port 50000 --mode &lt;sft|zero_shot|cross_lingual|instruct&gt;
# for fastapi usage
docker run -d --runtime=nvidia -p 50000:50000 cosyvoice:v1.0 /bin/bash -c &quot;cd /opt/CosyVoice/CosyVoice/runtime/python/fastapi &amp;&amp; python3 server.py --port 50000 --model_dir iic/CosyVoice-300M &amp;&amp; sleep infinity&quot;
cd fastapi &amp;&amp; python3 client.py --port 50000 --mode &lt;sft|zero_shot|cross_lingual|instruct&gt;
```

#### Using Nvidia TensorRT-LLM for deployment

Using TensorRT-LLM to accelerate cosyvoice2 llm could give 4x acceleration comparing with huggingface transformers implementation.
To quick start:

``` sh
cd runtime/triton_trtllm
docker compose up -d
```

The first financial Platform that is open source.

The OpenBB Platform offers access to equity, options, crypto, forex, macro economy, fixed income, and more while also offering a broad range of extensions to enhance the user experience according to their needs.

Get started with: `pip install openbb`

```python
from openbb import obb
output = obb.equity.price.historical(&quot;AAPL&quot;)
df = output.to_dataframe()
```

Data integrations available can be found here: &lt;https://docs.openbb.co/platform/reference&gt;

## News


**May 20, 2025**
- We are releasing **[Stable Video 4D 2.0 (SV4D 2.0)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d2.0)**, an enhanced video-to-4D diffusion model for high-fidelity novel-view video synthesis and 4D asset generation. For research purposes:
    - **SV4D 2.0** was trained to generate 48 frames (12 video frames x 4 camera views) at 576x576 resolution, given a 12-frame input video of the same size, ideally consisting of white-background images of a moving object.
    - Compared to our previous 4D model [SV4D](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d), **SV4D 2.0** can generate videos with higher fidelity, sharper details during motion, and better spatio-temporal consistency. It also generalizes much better to real-world videos. Moreover, it does not rely on refernce multi-view of the first frame generated by SV3D, making it more robust to self-occlusions.
    - To generate longer novel-view videos, we autoregressively generate 12 frames at a time and use the previous generation as conditioning views for the remaining frames.
    - Please check our [project page](https://sv4d20.github.io), [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16396) and [video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtqj-s50ynU) for more details.

**QUICKSTART** :
- `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample_4d2.py --input_path assets/sv4d_videos/camel.gif --output_folder outputs` (after downloading [sv4d2.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d2.0) from HuggingFace into `checkpoints/`)

To run **SV4D 2.0** on a single input video of 21 frames:
- Download SV4D 2.0 model (`sv4d2.safetensors`) from [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d2.0) to `checkpoints/`: `huggingface-cli download stabilityai/sv4d2.0 sv4d2.safetensors --local-dir checkpoints`
- Run inference: `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample_4d2.py --input_path &lt;path/to/video&gt;`
    - `input_path` : The input video `&lt;path/to/video&gt;` can be
      - a single video file in `gif` or `mp4` format, such as `assets/sv4d_videos/camel.gif`, or
      - a folder containing images of video frames in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format, or
      - a file name pattern matching images of video frames.
    - `num_steps` : default is 50, can decrease to it to shorten sampling time.
    - `elevations_deg` : specified elevations (reletive to input view), default is 0.0 (same as input view).
    - **Background removal** : For input videos with plain background, (optionally) use [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) to remove background and crop video frames by setting `--remove_bg=True`. To obtain higher quality outputs on real-world input videos with noisy background, try segmenting the foreground object using [Clipdrop](https://clipdrop.co/) or [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2) before running SV4D.
    - **Low VRAM environment** : To run on GPUs with low VRAM, try setting `--encoding_t=1` (of frames encoded at a time) and `--decoding_t=1` (of frames decoded at a time) or lower video resolution like `--img_size=512`.

Notes:
- We also train a 8-view model that generates 5 frames x 8 views at a time (same as SV4D).
  - Download the model from huggingface: `huggingface-cli download stabilityai/sv4d2.0 sv4d2_8views.safetensors --local-dir checkpoints`
  - Run inference: `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample_4d2.py --model_path checkpoints/sv4d2_8views.safetensors --input_path assets/sv4d_videos/chest.gif --output_folder outputs`
  - The 5x8 model takes 5 frames of input at a time. But the inference scripts for both model take 21-frame video as input by default (same as SV3D and SV4D), we run the model autoregressively until we generate 21 frames.
- Install dependencies before running:
```
python3.10 -m venv .generativemodels
source .generativemodels/bin/activate
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # check CUDA version
pip3 install -r requirements/pt2.txt
pip3 install .
pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/Stability-AI/datapipelines.git@main#egg=sdata
```

**July 24, 2024**
- We are releasing **[Stable Video 4D (SV4D)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d)**, a video-to-4D diffusion model for novel-view video synthesis. For research purposes:
    - **SV4D** was trained to generate 40 frames (5 video frames x 8 camera views) at 576x576 resolution, given 5 context frames (the input video), and 8 reference views (synthesised from the first frame of the input video, using a multi-view diffusion model like SV3D) of the same size, ideally white-background images with one object.
    - To generate longer novel-view videos (21 frames), we propose a novel sampling method using SV4D, by first sampling 5 anchor frames and then densely sampling the remaining frames while maintaining temporal consistency.
    - To run the community-build gradio demo locally, run `python -m scripts.demo.gradio_app_sv4d`.
    - Please check our [project page](https://sv4d.github.io), [tech report](https://sv4d.github.io/static/sv4d_technical_report.pdf) and [video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBP8vdAWTgk) for more details.

**QUICKSTART** : `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample_4d.py --input_path assets/sv4d_videos/test_video1.mp4 --output_folder outputs/sv4d` (after downloading [sv4d.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d) and [sv3d_u.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d) from HuggingFace into `checkpoints/`)

To run **SV4D** on a single input video of 21 frames:
- Download SV3D models (`sv3d_u.safetensors` and `sv3d_p.safetensors`) from [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d) and SV4D model (`sv4d.safetensors`) from [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv4d) to `checkpoints/`
- Run `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample_4d.py --input_path &lt;path/to/video&gt;`
    - `input_path` : The input video `&lt;path/to/video&gt;` can be
      - a single video file in `gif` or `mp4` format, such as `assets/sv4d_videos/test_video1.mp4`, or
      - a folder containing images of video frames in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format, or
      - a file name pattern matching images of video frames.
    - `num_steps` : default is 20, can increase to 50 for better quality but longer sampling time.
    - `sv3d_version` : To specify the SV3D model to generate reference multi-views, set `--sv3d_version=sv3d_u` for SV3D_u or `--sv3d_version=sv3d_p` for SV3D_p.
    - `elevations_deg` : To generate novel-view videos at a specified elevation (default elevation is 10) using SV3D_p (default is SV3D_u), run `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample_4d.py --input_path assets/sv4d_videos/test_video1.mp4 --sv3d_version sv3d_p --elevations_deg 30.0`
    - **Background removal** : For input videos with plain background, (optionally) use [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) to remove background and crop video frames by setting `--remove_bg=True`. To obtain higher quality outputs on real-world input videos with noisy background, try segmenting the foreground object using [Clipdrop](https://clipdrop.co/) or [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2) before running SV4D.
    - **Low VRAM environment** : To run on GPUs with low VRAM, try setting `--encoding_t=1` (of frames encoded at a time) and `--decoding_t=1` (of frames decoded at a time) or lower video resolution like `--img_size=512`.

**March 18, 2024**
- We are releasing **[SV3D](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d)**, an image-to-video model for novel multi-view synthesis, for research purposes:
    - **SV3D** was trained to generate 21 frames at resolution 576x576, given 1 context frame of the same size, ideally a white-background image with one object.
    - **SV3D_u**: This variant generates orbital videos based on single image inputs without camera conditioning..
    - **SV3D_p**: Extending the capability of **SVD3_u**, this variant accommodates both single images and orbital views allowing for the creation of 3D video along specified camera paths.
    - We extend the streamlit demo `scripts/demo/video_sampling.py` and the standalone python script `scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample.py` for inference of both models.
    - Please check our [project page](https://sv3d.github.io), [tech report](https://sv3d.github.io/static/paper.pdf) and [video summary](https://youtu.be/Zqw4-1LcfWg) for more details.

To run **SV3D_u** on a single image:
- Download `sv3d_u.safetensors` from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d to `checkpoints/sv3d_u.safetensors`
- Run `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample.py --input_path &lt;path/to/image.png&gt; --version sv3d_u`

To run **SV3D_p** on a single image:
- Download `sv3d_p.safetensors` from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d to `checkpoints/sv3d_p.safetensors`
1. Generate static orbit at a specified elevation eg. 10.0 : `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample.py --input_path &lt;path/to/image.png&gt; --version sv3d_p --elevations_deg 10.0`
2. Generate dynamic orbit at a specified elevations and azimuths: specify sequences of 21 elevations (in degrees) to `elevations_deg` ([-90, 90]), and 21 azimuths (in degrees) to `azimuths_deg` [0, 360] in sorted order from 0 to 360. For example: `python scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample.py --input_path &lt;path/to/image.png&gt; --version sv3d_p --elevations_deg [&lt;list of 21 elevations in degrees&gt;] --azimuths_deg [&lt;list of 21 azimuths in degrees&gt;]`

To run SVD or SV3D on a streamlit server:
`streamlit run scripts/demo/video_sampling.py`

**November 21, 2023**
- We are releasing Stable Video Diffusion, an image-to-video model, for research purposes:
    - [SVD](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid): This model was trained to generate 14
      frames at resolution 576x1024 given a context frame of the same size.
      We use the standard image encoder from SD 2.1, but replace the decoder with a temporally-aware `deflickering decoder`.
    - [SVD-XT](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt): Same architecture as `SVD` but finetuned
      for 25 frame generation.
    - You can run the community-build gradio demo locally by running `python -m scripts.demo.gradio_app`.
    - We provide a streamlit demo `scripts/demo/video_sampling.py` and a standalone python script `scripts/sampling/simple_video_sample.py` for inference of both models.
    - Alongside the model, we release a [technical report](https://stability.ai/research/stable-video-diffusion-scaling-latent-video-diffusion-models-to-large-datasets).

**July 26, 2023**

- We are releasing two new open models with a
  permissive [`CreativeML Open RAIL++-M` license](model_licenses/LICENSE-SDXL1.0) (see [Inference](#inference) for file
  hashes):
    - [SDXL-base-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0): An improved version
      over `SDXL-base-0.9`.
    - [SDXL-refiner-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0): An improved version
      over `SDXL-refiner-0.9`.

![sample2](assets/001_with_eval.png)

**July 4, 2023**

- A technical report on SDXL is now available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952).

**June 22, 2023**

- We are releasing two new diffusion models for research purposes:
    - `SDXL-base-0.9`: The base model was trained on a variety of aspect ratios on images with resolution 1024^2. The
      base model uses [OpenCLIP-ViT/G](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)
      and [CLIP-ViT/L](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/tree/main) for text encoding whereas the refiner model only uses
      the OpenCLIP model.
    - `SDXL-refiner-0.9`: The refiner has been trained to denoise small noise levels of high quality data and as such is
      not expected to work as a text-to-image model; instead, it should only be used as an image-to-image model.

If you would like to access these models for your research, please apply using one of the following links:
[SDXL-0.9-Base model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-0.9),
and [SDXL-0.9-Refiner](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-0.9).
This means that you can apply for any of the two links - and if you are granted - you can access both.
Please log in to your Hugging Face Account with your organization email to request access.
**We plan to do a full release soon (July).**

## The codebase

### General Philosophy

Modularity is king. This repo implements a config-driven approach where we build and combine submodules by
calling `instantiate_from_config()` on objects defined in yaml configs. See `configs/` for many examples.

### Changelog from the old `ldm` codebase

For training, we use [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/), but it should be easy to use other
training wrappers around the base modules. The core diffusion model class (formerly `LatentDiffusion`,
now `DiffusionEngine`) has been cleaned up:

- No more extensive subclassing! We now handle all types of conditioning inputs (vectors, sequences and spatial
  conditionings, and all combinations thereof) in a single class: `GeneralConditioner`,
  see `sgm/modules/encoders/modules.py`.
- We separate guiders (such as classifier-free guidance, see `sgm/modules/diffusionmodules/guiders.py`) from the
  samplers (`sgm/modules/diffusionmodules/sampling.py`), and the samplers are independent of the model.
- We adopt the [&quot;denoiser framework&quot;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) for both training and inference (most notable
  change is probably now the option to train continuous time models):
    * Discrete times models (denoisers) are simply a special case of continuous time models (denoisers);
      see `sgm/modules/diffusionmodules/denoiser.py`.
    * The following features are now independent: weighting of the diffusion loss
      function (`sgm/modules/diffusionmodules/denoiser_weighting.py`), preconditioning of the
      network (`sgm/modules/diffusionmodules/denoiser_scaling.py`), and sampling of noise levels during
      training (`sgm/modules/diffusionmodules/sigma_sampling.py`).
- Autoencoding models have also been cleaned up.

## Installation:

&lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

#### 1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models.git
cd generative-models
```

#### 2. Setting up the virtualenv

This is assuming you have navigated to the `generative-models` root after cloning it.

**NOTE:** This is tested under `python3.10`. For other python versions, you might encounter version conflicts.

**PyTorch 2.0**

```shell
# install required packages from pypi
python3 -m venv .pt2
source .pt2/bin/activate
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip3 install -r requirements/pt2.txt
```

#### 3. Install `sgm`

```shell
pip3 install .
```

#### 4. Install `sdata` for training

```shell
pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/Stability-AI/datapipelines.git@main#egg=sdata
```

## Packaging

This repository uses PEP 517 compliant packaging using [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/).

To build a distributable wheel, install `hatch` and run `hatch build`
(specifying `-t wheel` will skip building a sdist, which is not necessary).

```
pip install hatch
hatch build -t wheel
```

You will find the built package in `dist/`. You can install the wheel with `pip install dist/*.whl`.

Note that the package does **not** currently specify dependencies; you will need to install the required packages,
depending on your use case and PyTorch version, manually.

## Inference

We provide a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) demo for text-to-image and image-to-image sampling
in `scripts/demo/sampling.py`.
We provide file hashes for the complete file as well as for only the saved tensors in the file (
see [Model Spec](https://github.com/Stability-AI/ModelSpec) for a script to evaluate that).
The following models are currently supported:

- [SDXL-base-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)
  ```
  File Hash (sha256): 31e35c80fc4829d14f90153f4c74cd59c90b779f6afe05a74cd6120b893f7e5b

```

### Invisible Watermark Detection

Images generated with our code use the
[invisible-watermark](https://github.com/ShieldMnt/invisible-watermark/)
library to embed an invisible watermark into the model output. We also provide
a script to easily detect that watermark. Please note that this watermark is
not the same as in previous Stable Diffusion 1.x/2.x versions.

To run the script you need to either have a working installation as above or
try an _experimental_ import using only a minimal amount of packages:

```bash
python -m venv .detect
source .detect/bin/activate

pip install &quot;numpy&gt;=1.17&quot; &quot;PyWavelets&gt;=1.1.1&quot; &quot;opencv-python&gt;=4.1.0.25&quot;
pip install --no-deps invisible-watermark
```

To run the script you need to have a working installation as above. The script
is then useable in the following ways (don&#039;t forget to activate your
virtual environment beforehand, e.g. `source .pt1/bin/activate`):

```bash
# test a single file
python scripts/demo/detect.py &lt;your filename here&gt;
# test multiple files at once
python scripts/demo/detect.py &lt;filename 1&gt; &lt;filename 2&gt; ... &lt;filename n&gt;
# test all files in a specific folder
python scripts/demo/detect.py &lt;your folder name here&gt;/*
```

## Training:

We are providing example training configs in `configs/example_training`. To launch a training, run

```
python main.py --base configs/&lt;config1.yaml&gt; configs/&lt;config2.yaml&gt;
```

where configs are merged from left to right (later configs overwrite the same values).

Philosophy
==========

The main goals for this playlist are listed below.

**Quality over quantity**

The less channels we support the better.

- All channels should work well.
- As much as possible channels should be in HD, not SD.
- Only one URL per channel (no +1, no alternate feeds, no regional declinations)

**Only free channels**

If a channel is normally only available via commercial subscriptions it has nothing to do in this playlist. If on the other hand it is provided for free to everybody in a particular country, then it should be in this playlist.

- No paid channels
- Only channels which are officially provided for free (via DVB-S, DVB-T, analog, etc..)

**Only mainstream channels**

This is a playlist for everybody.

- No adult channels
- No channels dedicated to any particular religion
- No channels dedicated to any particular political party
- No channels made for a country and funded by a different country

Feed sources
============

It can be quite hard to find up to date URLs, here&#039;s a list of sources:

- https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/tree/master/streams
- Youtube: As long as the channel is live and its URL doesn&#039;t change (check the age of the stream, the number of viewers..)
- Dailymotion: Same criteria as for youtube

Format
======

The m3u8 playlist is generated by `make_playlist.py`, using the `.md` files located in `lists`.

Each .md file represesnts a group. The `&lt;h1&gt;` line is used as the group title.

Only channels which URL column starts with `[&gt;]` are included in the playlist.

Channels which are not in HD are marked with an `Ⓢ`.

Channels which use GeoIP blocking are marked with a `Ⓖ`.

Channels which are live Youtube channels are marked with a `Ⓨ`.

Issues
======

Only create issues for bugs and feature requests.

Do not create issues to add/edit or to remove channels. If you want to add/edit/remove channels, create a pull request directly.

Pull Requests
=============

**Only modify .md files**

If your Pull Request modifies channels, only modify .md files. Do not modify m3u8 files in your pull request.

**Adding a new Channel**

To add a new channel, make a Pull Request.

- In your Pull Request you need to provide information to show that the channel is free.
- Use imgur.com to host the channel logo and point to it.
- If you have a valid stream, add it and put `[&gt;]` in front of it.
- If you don&#039;t have an stream for the channel, add `[x]()` in the url column and place your channel in the Invalid category.
- If you have a stream but it doesn&#039;t work well, put the channel in the Invalid category and put `[x]` in front of the url.
- If you&#039;re adding geoblocked URLs specify it in your PR and specify which country they&#039;re working in. The PR will only be merged if these URLs can be tested.

**Removing a Channel**

To remove a channel, make a Pull Request.

In your Pull Request you need to provide information to show that the channel is only available via a private paid subscription.

Note: Public taxes (whether national or regional, whether called TV License or not) do not constitute a private paid subscription.

If a stream is broken, simply move the channel to the invalid category and replace `[&gt;]` with `[x]` in the url column.

```Python
from llava.model.builder import load_pretrained_model
from llava.mm_utils import get_model_name_from_path
from llava.eval.run_llava import eval_model

model_path = &quot;liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b&quot;

tokenizer, model, image_processor, context_len = load_pretrained_model(
    model_path=model_path,
    model_base=None,
    model_name=get_model_name_from_path(model_path)
)
```

Check out the details wth the `load_pretrained_model` function in `llava/model/builder.py`.

``` python
model_path = &quot;liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b&quot;
prompt = &quot;What are the things I should be cautious about when I visit here?&quot;
image_file = &quot;https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg&quot;

args = type(&#039;Args&#039;, (), {
    &quot;model_path&quot;: model_path,
    &quot;model_base&quot;: None,
    &quot;model_name&quot;: get_model_name_from_path(model_path),

## Demo

### Gradio Web UI

To launch a Gradio demo locally, please run the following commands one by one. If you plan to launch multiple model workers to compare between different checkpoints, you only need to launch the controller and the web server *ONCE*.

```

#### Launch a controller
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

#### Launch a gradio web server.
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000 --model-list-mode reload
```
You just launched the Gradio web interface. Now, you can open the web interface with the URL printed on the screen. You may notice that there is no model in the model list. Do not worry, as we have not launched any model worker yet. It will be automatically updated when you launch a model worker.

#### Launch a SGLang worker

This is the recommended way to serve LLaVA model with high throughput, and you need to install SGLang first. Note that currently `4-bit` quantization is not supported yet on SGLang-LLaVA, and if you have limited GPU VRAM, please check out model worker with [quantization](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA?tab=readme-ov-file#launch-a-model-worker-4-bit-8-bit-inference-quantized).

```Shell
pip install &quot;sglang[all]&quot;
```

You&#039;ll first launch a SGLang backend worker which will execute the models on GPUs. Remember the `--port` you&#039;ve set and you&#039;ll use that later.

```Shell
# Single GPU
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b --tokenizer-path llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf --port 30000

# Multiple GPUs with tensor parallel
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-13b --tokenizer-path llava-hf/llava-1.5-13b-hf --port 30000 --tp 2
```

Tokenizers (temporary): `llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf`, `llava-hf/llava-1.5-13b-hf`, `liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-34b-tokenizer`.

You&#039;ll then launch a LLaVA-SGLang worker that will communicate between LLaVA controller and SGLang backend to route the requests. Set `--sgl-endpoint` to `http://127.0.0.1:port` where `port` is the one you just set (default: 30000).

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.sglang_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --sgl-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:30000
```

#### Launch a model worker

This is the actual *worker* that performs the inference on the GPU.  Each worker is responsible for a single model specified in `--model-path`.

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-13b
```
Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see &quot;Uvicorn running on ...&quot;.  Now, refresh your Gradio web UI, and you will see the model you just launched in the model list.

You can launch as many workers as you want, and compare between different model checkpoints in the same Gradio interface. Please keep the `--controller` the same, and modify the `--port` and `--worker` to a different port number for each worker.
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port &lt;different from 40000, say 40001&gt; --worker http://localhost:&lt;change accordingly, i.e. 40001&gt; --model-path &lt;ckpt2&gt;
```

If you are using an Apple device with an M1 or M2 chip, you can specify the mps device by using the `--device` flag: `--device mps`.

#### Launch a model worker (Multiple GPUs, when GPU VRAM &lt;= 24GB)

If the VRAM of your GPU is less than 24GB (e.g., RTX 3090, RTX 4090, etc.), you may try running it with multiple GPUs. Our latest code base will automatically try to use multiple GPUs if you have more than one GPU. You can specify which GPUs to use with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Below is an example of running with the first two GPUs.

```Shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-13b
```

#### Launch a model worker (4-bit, 8-bit inference, quantized)

You can launch the model worker with quantized bits (4-bit, 8-bit), which allows you to run the inference with reduced GPU memory footprint, potentially allowing you to run on a GPU with as few as 12GB VRAM. Note that inference with quantized bits may not be as accurate as the full-precision model. Simply append `--load-4bit` or `--load-8bit` to the **model worker** command that you are executing. Below is an example of running with 4-bit quantization.

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-13b --load-4bit
```

#### Launch a model worker (LoRA weights, unmerged)

You can launch the model worker with LoRA weights, without merging them with the base checkpoint, to save disk space. There will be additional loading time, while the inference speed is the same as the merged checkpoints. Unmerged LoRA checkpoints do not have `lora-merge` in the model name, and are usually much smaller (less than 1GB) than the merged checkpoints (13G for 7B, and 25G for 13B).

To load unmerged LoRA weights, you simply need to pass an additional argument `--model-base`, which is the base LLM that is used to train the LoRA weights. You can check the base LLM of each LoRA weights in the [model zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md).

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path liuhao
