## What is Genesis?

Genesis is a physics platform designed for general-purpose *Robotics/Embodied AI/Physical AI* applications. It is simultaneously multiple things:

1. A **universal physics engine** re-built from the ground up, capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena.
2. A **lightweight**, **ultra-fast**, **pythonic**, and **user-friendly** robotics simulation platform.
3. A powerful and fast **photo-realistic rendering system**.
4. A **generative data engine** that transforms user-prompted natural language description into various modalities of data.

Powered by a universal physics engine re-designed and re-built from the ground up, Genesis integrates various physics solvers and their coupling into a unified framework. This core physics engine is further enhanced by a generative agent framework that operates at an upper level, aiming towards fully automated data generation for robotics and beyond.

**Note**: Currently, we are open-sourcing the _underlying physics engine_ and the _simulation platform_. Our _generative framework_ is a modular system that incorporates many different generative modules, each handling a certain range of data modalities, routed by a high level agent. Some of the modules integrated existing papers and some are still under submission. Access to our generative feature will be gradually rolled out in the near future. If you are interested, feel free to explore more in the [paper list](#associated-papers) below.

Genesis aims to:

- **Lower the barrier** to using physics simulations, making robotics research accessible to everyone. See our [mission statement](https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/overview/mission.html).
- **Unify diverse physics solvers** into a single framework to recreate the physical world with the highest fidelity.
- **Automate data generation**, reducing human effort and letting the data flywheel spin on its own.

Project Page: &lt;https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/&gt;

## Key Features

- **Speed**: Over 43 million FPS when simulating a Franka robotic arm with a single RTX 4090 (430,000 times faster than real-time).
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and supports multiple compute backends (CPU, Nvidia/AMD GPUs, Apple Metal).
- **Integration of diverse physics solvers**: Rigid body, MPM, SPH, FEM, PBD, Stable Fluid.
- **Wide range of material models**: Simulation and coupling of rigid bodies, liquids, gases, deformable objects, thin-shell objects, and granular materials.
- **Compatibility with various robots**: Robotic arms, legged robots, drones, *soft robots*, and support for loading `MJCF (.xml)`, `URDF`, `.obj`, `.glb`, `.ply`, `.stl`, and more.
- **Photo-realistic rendering**: Native ray-tracing-based rendering.
- **Differentiability**: Genesis is designed to be fully differentiable. Currently, our MPM solver and Tool Solver support differentiability, with other solvers planned for future versions (starting with rigid &amp; articulated body solver).
- **Physics-based tactile simulation**: Differentiable [tactile sensor simulation](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/DiffTactile) coming soon (expected in version 0.3.0).
- **User-friendliness**: Designed for simplicity, with intuitive installation and APIs.

## Quick Installation

Install **PyTorch** first following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Then, install Genesis via PyPI:
```bash
pip install genesis-world  # Requires Python&gt;=3.10,&lt;3.13;
```

For the latest version to date, make sure that `pip` is up-to-date via `pip install --upgrade pip`, then run command:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis.git
```
Note that the package must still be updated manually to sync with main branch.

Users seeking to edit the source code of Genesis are encourage to install Genesis in editable mode. First, make sure that `genesis-world` has been uninstalled, then clone the repository and install locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis.git
cd Genesis
pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;
```

## Docker

If you want to use Genesis from Docker, you can first build the Docker image as:

```bash
docker build -t genesis -f docker/Dockerfile docker
```

Then you can run the examples inside the docker image (mounted to `/workspace/examples`):

```bash
xhost +local:root # Allow the container to access the display

docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
-v /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
-v /tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix \
-v $PWD:/workspace \
genesis
```

### AMD users
AMD users can use Genesis using the `docker/Dockerfile.amdgpu` file, which is built by running:
```
docker build -t genesis-amd -f docker/Dockerfile.amdgpu docker
```

and can then be used by running:

```xhost +local:docker \
docker run -it --network=host \
 --device=/dev/kfd \
 --device=/dev/dri \
 --group-add=video \
 --ipc=host \
 --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
 --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
 --shm-size 8G \
 -v $PWD:/workspace \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 genesis-amd
 ```

The examples will be accessible from `/workspace/examples`. Note: AMD users should use the vulkan backend. This means you will need to call `gs.init(vulkan)` to initialise Genesis.

## Frappe HR

Frappe HR has everything you need to drive excellence within the company. It&#039;s a complete HRMS solution with over 13 different modules right from Employee Management, Onboarding, Leaves, to Payroll, Taxation, and more!

## Motivation
When Frappe team started growing in terms of size, we needed an open-source HR and Payroll software. We didn&#039;t find any &quot;true&quot; open-source HR software out there and so decided to build one ourselves.
Initially, it was a set of modules within ERPNext but version 14 onwards, as the modules became more mature, Frappe HR was created as a separate product.

## Key Features

- **Employee Lifecycle**: From onboarding employees, managing promotions and transfers, all the way to documenting feedback with exit interviews, make life easier for employees throughout their life cycle.
- **Leave and Attendance**: Configure leave policies, pull regional holidays with a click, check-in and check-out with geolocation capturing, track leave balances and attendance with reports.
- **Expense Claims and Advances**: Manage employee advances, claim expenses, configure multi-level approval workflows, all this with seamless integration with ERPNext accounting.
- **Performance Management**: Track goals, align goals with key result areas (KRAs), enable employees to evaluate themselves, make managing appraisal cycles easy.
- **Payroll &amp; Taxation**: Create salary structures, configure income tax slabs, run standard payroll, accomodate additional salaries and off cycle payments, view income breakup on salary slips and so much more.
- **Frappe HR Mobile App**: Apply for and approve leaves on the go, check-in and check-out, access employee profile right from the mobile app.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Under the Hood

- [**Frappe Framework**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework written in Python and Javascript. The framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.

- [**Frappe UI**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface. The Frappe UI library provides a variety of components that can be used to build single-page applications on top of the Frappe Framework.

## Production Setup

### Managed Hosting

You can try [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple, user-friendly and sophisticated [open-source](https://github.com/frappe/press) platform to host Frappe applications with peace of mind.

It takes care of installation, setup, upgrades, monitoring, maintenance and support of your Frappe deployments. It is a fully featured developer platform with an ability to manage and control multiple Frappe deployments.

		&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Development setup
### Docker
You need Docker, docker-compose and git setup on your machine. Refer [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). After that, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/frappe/hrms
cd hrms/docker
docker-compose up
```

Wait for some time until the setup script creates a site. After that you can access `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and the login screen for HR should show up.

Use the following credentials to log in:

- Username: `Administrator`
- Password: `admin`

### Local

1. Set up bench by following the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) and start the server and keep it running
	```sh
	$ bench start
	```
2. In a separate terminal window, run the following commands
	```sh
	$ bench new-site hrms.local
	$ bench get-app erpnext
	$ bench get-app hrms
	$ bench --site hrms.local install-app hrms
	$ bench --site hrms.local add-to-hosts
	```
3. You can access the site at `http://hrms.local:8080`

## About

OWASP Nest was **originally created by Arkadii Yakovets** (Ark) to address challenges in navigating OWASP projects. The project was **built from scratch based on Ark&#039;s ideas and discussions with Starr Brown** (Starr), ensuring a well-structured system design aligned with OWASP&#039;s ecosystem. Ark, an experienced software development professional with over 10 years of expertise in Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), and related backend technologies, led the development of the backend using widely adopted Python **open-source frameworks and libraries**, including DRF, django-filter, OpenAI, Algolia Search, slack-bolt, PyGitHub, pre-commit, pytest, and more. The initial frontend, based on Vue.js, was introduced by **Kateryna Golovanova** (Kate), who later became the project co-leader due to her invaluable frontend and project management skills. The **code is licensed under the MIT License**, encouraging contributions while protecting the authors from legal claims. All OWASP Nest leaders are OWASP members and adhere to the OWASP Code of Conduct.

Over time, OWASP Nest has expanded to address broader OWASP community needs, such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student guidance and contribution opportunities discovery. The platform, along with NestBot, has become a popular entry point for various OWASP aspects, including projects, chapters, users, and aggregated contribution opportunities -- with even more features planned. OWASP Nest&#039;s success is also the result of many valuable [contributions](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/graphs/contributors) from the broader [OWASP Nest community](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/project-nest), whose efforts have helped shape and improve the project in countless ways.

**No other OWASP projects&#039; code was used in OWASP Nest&#039;s development.** While explicit attribution (other than per MIT license) is not required, contributors and other OWASP project leaders are welcome to provide it at their discretion.

## Filters

XPath(1.0), JSONPath, jq, and CSS support comes baked in! You can be as specific as you need, use XPath exported from various XPath element query creation tools. 
(We support LXML `re:test`, `re:match` and `re:replace`.)

## Notifications

ChangeDetection.io supports a massive amount of notifications (including email, office365, custom APIs, etc) when a web-page has a change detected thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/caronc/apprise&quot;&gt;apprise&lt;/a&gt; library.
Simply set one or more notification URL&#039;s in the _[edit]_ tab of that watch.

Just some examples

    discord://webhook_id/webhook_token
    flock://app_token/g:channel_id
    gitter://token/room
    gchat://workspace/key/token
    msteams://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC/
    o365://TenantID:AccountEmail/ClientID/ClientSecret/TargetEmail
    rocket://user:password@hostname/#Channel
    mailto://user:pass@example.com?to=receivingAddress@example.com
    json://someserver.com/custom-api
    syslog://
 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/caronc/apprise#popular-notification-services&quot;&gt;And everything else in this list!&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/screenshot-notifications.png&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications&quot;  title=&quot;Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications&quot;  /&gt;

Now you can also customise your notification content and use &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/&quot;&gt;Jinja2 templating&lt;/a&gt; for their title and body!

## JSON API Monitoring

Detect changes and monitor data in JSON API&#039;s by using either JSONPath or jq to filter, parse, and restructure JSON as needed.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-filter-field-example.png)

This will re-parse the JSON and apply formatting to the text, making it super easy to monitor and detect changes in JSON API results

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-diff-example.png)

### JSONPath or jq?

For more complex parsing, filtering, and modifying of JSON data, jq is recommended due to the built-in operators and functions. Refer to the [documentation](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for more specific information on jq.

One big advantage of `jq` is that you can use logic in your JSON filter, such as filters to only show items that have a value greater than/less than etc.

See the wiki https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help for more information and examples

### Parse JSON embedded in HTML!

When you enable a `json:` or `jq:` filter, you can even automatically extract and parse embedded JSON inside a HTML page! Amazingly handy for sites that build content based on JSON, such as many e-commerce websites. 

```
&lt;html&gt;
...
&lt;script type=&quot;application/ld+json&quot;&gt;

{
   &quot;@context&quot;:&quot;http://schema.org/&quot;,
   &quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Product&quot;,
   &quot;offers&quot;:{
      &quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Offer&quot;,
      &quot;availability&quot;:&quot;http://schema.org/InStock&quot;,
      &quot;price&quot;:&quot;3949.99&quot;,
      &quot;priceCurrency&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.newegg.com/p/3D5-000D-001T1&quot;
   },
   &quot;description&quot;:&quot;Cobratype King Cobra Hero Desktop Gaming PC&quot;,
   &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cobratype King Cobra Hero Desktop Gaming PC&quot;,
   &quot;sku&quot;:&quot;3D5-000D-001T1&quot;,
   &quot;itemCondition&quot;:&quot;NewCondition&quot;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
```  

`json:$..price` or `jq:..price` would give `3949.99`, or you can extract the whole structure (use a JSONpath test website to validate with)

The application also supports notifying you that it can follow this information automatically


## Proxy Configuration

See the wiki https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Proxy-configuration , we also support using [Bright Data proxy services where possible](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Proxy-configuration#brightdata-proxy-support) and [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.go2cloud.org/SH2d) proxy services.

## Raspberry Pi support?

Raspberry Pi and linux/arm/v6 linux/arm/v7 arm64 devices are supported! See the wiki for [details](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Fetching-pages-with-WebDriver)

## Import support

Easily [import your list of websites to watch for changes in Excel .xslx file format](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/how-import-your-website-change-detection-lists-excel), or paste in lists of website URLs as plaintext. 

Excel import is recommended - that way you can better organise tags/groups of websites and other features.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## MLX LM 

MLX LM is a Python package for generating text and fine-tuning large language
models on Apple silicon with MLX.

Some key features include:

* Integration with the Hugging Face Hub to easily use thousands of LLMs with a
  single command. 
* Support for quantizing and uploading models to the Hugging Face Hub.
* [Low-rank and full model
  fine-tuning](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/blob/main/mlx_lm/LORA.md)
  with support for quantized models.
* Distributed inference and fine-tuning with `mx.distributed`

The easiest way to get started is to install the `mlx-lm` package:

**With `pip`**:

```sh
pip install mlx-lm
```

**With `conda`**:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge mlx-lm
```

### Quick Start

To generate text with an LLM use:

```bash
mlx_lm.generate --prompt &quot;How tall is Mt Everest?&quot;
```

To chat with an LLM use:

```bash
mlx_lm.chat
```

This will give you a chat REPL that you can use to interact with the LLM. The
chat context is preserved during the lifetime of the REPL.

Commands in `mlx-lm` typically take command line options which let you specify
the model, sampling parameters, and more. Use `-h` to see a list of available
options for a command, e.g.:

```bash
mlx_lm.generate -h
```

### Python API

You can use `mlx-lm` as a module:

```python
from mlx_lm import load, generate

model, tokenizer = load(&quot;mlx-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit&quot;)

prompt = &quot;Write a story about Einstein&quot;

messages = [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}]
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, add_generation_prompt=True
)

text = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)
```

To see a description of all the arguments you can do:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(generate)
```

Check out the [generation
example](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/tree/main/mlx_lm/examples/generate_response.py)
to see how to use the API in more detail.

The `mlx-lm` package also comes with functionality to quantize and optionally
upload models to the Hugging Face Hub.

You can convert models using the Python API:

```python
from mlx_lm import convert

repo = &quot;mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3&quot;
upload_repo = &quot;mlx-community/My-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit&quot;

convert(repo, quantize=True, upload_repo=upload_repo)
```

This will generate a 4-bit quantized Mistral 7B and upload it to the repo
`mlx-community/My-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit`. It will also save the
converted model in the path `mlx_model` by default.

To see a description of all the arguments you can do:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(convert)
```

#### Streaming

For streaming generation, use the `stream_generate` function. This yields
a generation response object.

For example,

```python
from mlx_lm import load, stream_generate

repo = &quot;mlx-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit&quot;
model, tokenizer = load(repo)

prompt = &quot;Write a story about Einstein&quot;

messages = [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}]
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, add_generation_prompt=True
)

for response in stream_generate(model, tokenizer, prompt, max_tokens=512):
    print(response.text, end=&quot;&quot;, flush=True)
print()
```

#### Sampling

The `generate` and `stream_generate` functions accept `sampler` and
`logits_processors` keyword arguments. A sampler is any callable which accepts
a possibly batched logits array and returns an array of sampled tokens.  The
`logits_processors` must be a list of callables which take the token history
and current logits as input and return the processed logits. The logits
processors are applied in order.

Some standard sampling functions and logits processors are provided in
`mlx_lm.sample_utils`.

### Command Line

You can also use `mlx-lm` from the command line with:

```
mlx_lm.generate --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 --prompt &quot;hello&quot;
```

This will download a Mistral 7B model from the Hugging Face Hub and generate
text using the given prompt.

For a full list of options run:

```
mlx_lm.generate --help
```

To quantize a model from the command line run:

```
mlx_lm.convert --hf-path mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 -q
```

For more options run:

```
mlx_lm.convert --help
```

You can upload new models to Hugging Face by specifying `--upload-repo` to
`convert`. For example, to upload a quantized Mistral-7B model to the
[MLX Hugging Face community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) you can do:

```
mlx_lm.convert \
    --hf-path mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 \
    -q \
    --upload-repo mlx-community/my-4bit-mistral
```

Models can also be converted and quantized directly in the
[mlx-my-repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mlx-community/mlx-my-repo) Hugging
Face Space.

### Long Prompts and Generations 

`mlx-lm` has some tools to scale efficiently to long prompts and generations:

- A rotating fixed-size key-value cache.
- Prompt caching

To use the rotating key-value cache pass the argument `--max-kv-size n` where
`n` can be any integer. Smaller values like `512` will use very little RAM but
result in worse quality. Larger values like `4096` or higher will use more RAM
but have better quality.

Caching prompts can substantially speedup reusing the same long context with
different queries. To cache a prompt use `mlx_lm.cache_prompt`. For example:

```bash
cat prompt.txt | mlx_lm.cache_prompt \
  --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 \
  --prompt - \
  --prompt-cache-file mistral_prompt.safetensors
``` 

Then use the cached prompt with `mlx_lm.generate`:

```
mlx_lm.generate \
    --prompt-cache-file mistral_prompt.safetensors \
    --prompt &quot;\nSummarize the above text.&quot;
```

The cached prompt is treated as a prefix to the supplied prompt. Also notice
when using a cached prompt, the model to use is read from the cache and need
not be supplied explicitly.

Prompt caching can also be used in the Python API in order to avoid
recomputing the prompt. This is useful in multi-turn dialogues or across
requests that use the same context. See the
[example](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/blob/main/mlx_lm/examples/chat.py)
for more usage details.

### Supported Models

`mlx-lm` supports thousands of Hugging Face format LLMs. If the model you want to
run is not supported, file an
[issue](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/issues/new) or better yet,
submit a pull request.

Here are a few examples of Hugging Face models that work with this example:

Most
[Mistral](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=mistral&amp;sort=trending),
[Llama](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=llama&amp;sort=trending),
[Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=phi&amp;sort=trending),
and
[Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=mixtral&amp;sort=trending)
style models should work out of the box.

For some models (such as `Qwen` and `plamo`) the tokenizer requires you to
enable the `trust_remote_code` option. You can do this by passing
`--trust-remote-code` in the command line. If you don&#039;t specify the flag
explicitly, you will be prompted to trust remote code in the terminal when
running the model. 

For `Qwen` models you must also specify the `eos_token`. You can do this by
passing `--eos-token &quot;&lt;|endoftext|&gt;&quot;` in the command
line. 

These options can also be set in the Python API. For example:

```python
model, tokenizer = load(
    &quot;qwen/Qwen-7B&quot;,
    tokenizer_config={&quot;eos_token&quot;: &quot;&lt;|endoftext|&gt;&quot;, &quot;trust_remote_code&quot;: True},
)
```

### Large Models

&gt; [!NOTE]
    This requires macOS 15.0 or higher to work.

Models which are large relative to the total RAM available on the machine can
be slow. `mlx-lm` will attempt to make them faster by wiring the memory
occupied by the model and cache. This requires macOS 15 or higher to
work.

If you see the following warning message:

&gt; [WARNING] Generating with a model that requires ...

then the model will likely be slow on the given machine. If the model fits in
RAM then it can often be sped up by increasing the system wired memory limit.
To increase the limit, set the following `sysctl`:

```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=N
```

The value `N` should be larger than the size of the model in megabytes but
smaller than the memory size of the machine.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/647e6bae-bc62-4c8b-9e6e-a7c8946caf56

## Overview

II Agent is built around providing an agentic interface to leading language models. It offers:

- A CLI interface for direct command-line interaction
- A WebSocket server that powers a modern React-based frontend
- Integration with multiple LLM providers:
  - Anthropic Claude models (direct API or via Google Cloud Vertex AI)
  - Google Gemini models (direct API or via Google Cloud Vertex AI)

## GAIA Benchmark Evaluation

II-Agent has been evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, which assesses LLM-based agents operating within realistic scenarios across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, tool utilization, and web searching.

We identified several issues with the GAIA benchmark during our evaluation:

- **Annotation Errors**: Several incorrect annotations in the dataset (e.g., misinterpreting date ranges, calculation errors)
- **Outdated Information**: Some questions reference websites or content no longer accessible
- **Language Ambiguity**: Unclear phrasing leading to different interpretations of questions

Despite these challenges, II-Agent demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning.

![GAIA Benchmark](assets/gaia.jpg)
You can view the full traces of some samples here: [GAIA Benchmark Traces](https://ii-agent-gaia.ii.inc/)

## Requirements

- Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- At least one of the following:
  - Anthropic API key, or
  - Google Gemini API key, or
  - Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled

&gt; \[!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; - For best performance, we recommend using Claude 4.0 Sonnet or Claude Opus 4.0 models.
&gt; - For fast and cheap, we recommend using GPT4.1 from OpenAI.
&gt; - Gemini 2.5 Pro is a good balance between performance and cost.

## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following command

```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

&lt;img width=&quot;821&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 17 50 34&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/094f73aa-7384-4500-a670-528853f92ae7&quot; /&gt;

Our II-Agent supports popular models such as Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI. If you’d like to use a model from OpenRouter, simply configure your OpenAI endpoint with your OpenRouter API key.
If you are using Vertex, run with these variables

```
chmod +x start.sh
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=absolute-path-to-credential ./start.sh
```



(Optional) You can fill Google API credentials to connect to google drive. Press enter to skip these steps

### Runtime Environment

&lt;img width=&quot;821&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 17 48 08&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1fb9f11-b1ef-4f62-bbea-9b67eba45322&quot; /&gt;

You can now select from a variety of models, set your API key, and configure environments—all directly from the frontend settings page—to equip your agents with powerful tools and capabilities. You can also change the agents&#039; runtime environment. Currently, we support three runtime modes: Local, Docker, and E2B. For full-stack web application development, Docker and E2B are highly recommended, while Local Mode is best suited for lighter tasks such as basic webpage building and research.

In addition, agents come equipped with built-in NeonDB and Vercel integration, enabling seamless cloud deployment of full-stack applications using a serverless database and serverless infrastructure.
