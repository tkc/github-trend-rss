            <h2>README</h2><pre># Agent Skills for Context Engineering

A comprehensive, open collection of Agent Skills focused on context engineering principles for building production-grade AI agent systems. These skills teach the art and science of curating context to maximize agent effectiveness across any agent platform.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the discipline of managing the language model&#039;s context window. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting effective instructions, context engineering addresses the holistic curation of all information that enters the model&#039;s limited attention budget: system prompts, tool definitions, retrieved documents, message history, and tool outputs.

The fundamental challenge is that context windows are constrained not by raw token capacity but by attention mechanics. As context length increases, models exhibit predictable degradation patterns: the &quot;lost-in-the-middle&quot; phenomenon, U-shaped attention curves, and attention scarcity. Effective context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes.

## Recognition

This repository is cited in academic research as foundational work on static skill architecture:

&gt; &quot;While static skills are well-recognized [Anthropic, 2025b; Muratcan Koylan, 2025], MCE is among the first to dynamically evolve them, bridging manual skill engineering and autonomous self-improvement.&quot;

— [Meta Context Engineering via Agentic Skill Evolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21557), Peking University State Key Laboratory of General Artificial Intelligence (2026)

## Skills Overview

### Foundational Skills

These skills establish the foundational understanding required for all subsequent context engineering work.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [context-fundamentals](skills/context-fundamentals/) | Understand what context is, why it matters, and the anatomy of context in agent systems |
| [context-degradation](skills/context-degradation/) | Recognize patterns of context failure: lost-in-middle, poisoning, distraction, and clash |
| [context-compression](skills/context-compression/) | Design and evaluate compression strategies for long-running sessions |

### Architectural Skills

These skills cover the patterns and structures for building effective agent systems.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [multi-agent-patterns](skills/multi-agent-patterns/) | Master orchestrator, peer-to-peer, and hierarchical multi-agent architectures |
| [memory-systems](skills/memory-systems/) | Design short-term, long-term, and graph-based memory architectures |
| [tool-design](skills/tool-design/) | Build tools that agents can use effectively |
| [filesystem-context](skills/filesystem-context/) | Use filesystems for dynamic context discovery, tool output offloading, and plan persistence |
| [hosted-agents](skills/hosted-agents/) | **NEW** Build background coding agents with sandboxed VMs, pre-built images, multiplayer support, and multi-client interfaces |

### Operational Skills

These skills address the ongoing operation and optimization of agent systems.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [context-optimization](skills/context-optimization/) | Apply compaction, masking, and caching strategies |
| [evaluation](skills/evaluation/) | Build evaluation frameworks for agent systems |
| [advanced-evaluation](skills/advanced-evaluation/) | Master LLM-as-a-Judge techniques: direct scoring, pairwise comparison, rubric generation, and bias mitigation |

### Development Methodology

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Disclosure

Each skill is structured for efficient context use. At startup, agents load only skill names and descriptions. Full content loads only when a skill is activated for relevant tasks.

### Platform Agnosticism

These skills focus on transferable principles rather than vendor-specific implementations. The patterns work across Claude Code, Cursor, and any agent platform that supports skills or allows custom instructions.

### Conceptual Foundation with Practical Examples

Scripts and examples demonstrate concepts using Python pseudocode that works across environments without requiring specific dependency installations.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Hugging Face Skills

Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic&#039;s Claude Code, Google DeepMind&#039;s Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## How do Skills work?

In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. 

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; &#039;Skills&#039; is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) format, where each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file that Codex discovers from standard `.agents/skills` locations documented in the [Codex Skills guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/). Codex can also work with an `AGENTS.md` file. Google Gemini uses &#039;extensions&#039; to define the instructions for your coding agent in a `gemini-extension.json` file. **This repo is compatible with all of them, and more!**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If your agent doesn&#039;t support skills, you can use [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) directly as a fallback.

## Installation

Hugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

### Claude Code

1. Register the repository as a plugin marketplace:  
   
```
/plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills
```

2. To install a skill, run:  
   
```
/plugin install &lt;skill-name&gt;@huggingface/skills
```

For example:  

```
/plugin install hugging-face-cli@huggingface/skills
```

### Codex

1. Copy or symlink any skills you want to use from this repository&#039;s `skills/` directory into one of Codex&#039;s standard `.agents/skills` locations (for example, `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills` or `$HOME/.agents/skills`) as described in the [Codex Skills guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/).

2. Once a skill is available in one of those locations, Codex will discover it using the Agent Skills standard and load the `SKILL.md` instructions when it decides to use that skill or when you explicitly invoke it.

3. If your Codex setup still relies on `AGENTS.md`, you can use the generated [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) file in this repo as a fallback bundle of instructions.

### Gemini CLI

1. This repo includes `gemini-extension.json` to integrate with the Gemini CLI.

2. Install locally:  

```
gemini extensions install . --consent
```

or use the GitHub URL:

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent
```

4. See [Gemini CLI extensions docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/#installing-an-extension) for more help.

### Cursor

This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json` (configured with the Hugging Face MCP server URL)

Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow.

For contributors, regenerate manifests with:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

&lt;!-- END_SKILLS_TABLE --&gt;

### Using skills in your coding agent

Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions:

- &quot;Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch `run_eval_job.py` on the latest checkpoint.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model.&quot;

Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding `SKILL.md` instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task.

### Contribute or customize a skill

1. Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `hf-datasets/`) and rename it.
2. Update the new folder&#039;s `SKILL.md` frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill-name
   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
   ---

   # Skill Title
   Guidance + examples + guardrails
   ```
3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.
4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with a concise, human-readable description.
5. Run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/publish.sh
   ```
   to regenerate and validate all generated metadata.
6. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.

### Marketplace

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file lists skills with human-readable descriptions for the plugin marketplace. The CI validates that skill names and paths match between `SKILL.md` files and `marketplace.json`, but descriptions are maintained separately: `SKILL.md` descriptions guide when Claude activates the skill, while marketplace descriptions are written for humans browsing available skills.

### Additional references
- Browse the latest instructions, scripts, and templates directly at [huggingface/skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills).
- Review Hugging Face documentation for the specific libraries or workflows you reference inside each skill.

pip install -r requirements_base.txt
```

### ⏬ Download weights
Option 1: Download pre-trained weights of base models and other components ([sd-image-variations-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers) and [sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse)). You can run the following command to download weights automatically:
    
```bash
python tools/download_weights.py
```

Option 2: Download pre-trained weights into the `./pretrained_weights` folder from one of the below URLs:
    
&lt;a href=&#039;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GOhDBKIeowkMpBnKhGB8jgEhJt_--vbT?usp=drive_link&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Drive-5B8DEF?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=googledrive&amp;logoColor=white&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#039;https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DCv4NvUy_z7Gj2xCGqRMkQ?pwd=gj64&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/badge/Baidu%20Netdisk-3E4A89?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=baidu&amp;logoColor=white&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#039;https://modelscope.cn/models/huaichang/PersonaLive&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/badge/ModelScope-624AFF?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=alibabacloud&amp;logoColor=white&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#039;https://huggingface.co/huaichang/PersonaLive&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/badge/HuggingFace-E67E22?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=huggingface&amp;logoColor=white&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### 🎞️ Offline Inference
Run offline inference with the default configuration:

```
python inference_offline.py
```

* `-L`: Max number of frames to generate. (Default: 100)
* `--use_xformers`: Enable xFormers memory efficient attention. (Default: True)
* `--stream_gen`: Enable streaming generation strategy. (Default: True)
* `--reference_image`: Path to a specific reference image. Overrides settings in config.
* `--driving_video`: Path to a specific driving video. Overrides settings in config.

⚠️ Note for RTX 50-Series (Blackwell) Users: xformers is not yet fully compatible with the new architecture. To avoid crashes, please disable it by running:

```
python inference_offline.py --use_xformers False
```

### 📸 Online Inference
#### 📦 Setup Web UI
```
# install Node.js 18+
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 18

source web_start.sh
```

#### 🏎️ Acceleration (Optional)
Converting the model to TensorRT can significantly speed up inference (~ 2x ⚡️). Building the engine may take about `20 minutes` depending on your device. Note that TensorRT optimizations may lead to slight variations or a small drop in output quality.
```
# Install packages with pip
pip install -r requirements_trt.txt

# Converting the model to TensorRT
python torch2trt.py
```
💡 **PyCUDA Installation Issues**: If you encounter a &quot;Failed to build wheel for pycuda&quot; error during the installation above, please follow these steps:
```
# Install PyCUDA manually using Conda (avoids compilation issues):
conda install -c conda-forge pycuda &quot;numpy&lt;2.0&quot;

# Open requirements_trt.txt and comment out or remove the line &quot;pycuda==2024.1.2&quot;

# Install other packages with pip
pip install -r requirements_trt.txt

# Converting the model to TensorRT
python torch2trt.py
```
⚠️ The provided TensorRT model is from an `H100`. We recommend `ALL users` (including H100 users) re-run `python torch2trt.py` locally to ensure best compatibility.

#### ▶️ Start Streaming
```
python inference_online.py --acceleration none (for RTX 50-Series) or xformers or tensorrt
```
Then open `http://0.0.0.0:7860` in your browser. (*If `http://0.0.0.0:7860` does not work well, try `http://localhost:7860`)

**How to use**: Upload Image ➡️ Fuse Reference ➡️ Start Animation ➡️ Enjoy! 🎉

&lt;/div&gt;

**Regarding Latency**: Latency varies depending on your device&#039;s computing power. You can try the following methods to optimize it:

1. Lower the &quot;Driving FPS&quot; setting in the WebUI to reduce the computational workload.
2. You can increase the multiplier (e.g., set to `num_frames_needed * 4` or higher) to better match your device&#039;s inference speed. https://github.com/GVCLab/PersonaLive/blob/6953d1a8b409f360a3ee1d7325093622b29f1e22/webcam/util.py#L73

## 1. Introduction

We present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. 
To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. 
Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. 
We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. 
Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models.
Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training.
In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. 
Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. 
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;80%&quot; src=&quot;figures/benchmark.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## 2. Model Summary

---

**Architecture: Innovative Load Balancing Strategy and Training Objective**

- On top of the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing, which minimizes the performance degradation that arises from encouraging load balancing.
-  We investigate a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective and prove it beneficial to model performance. 
    It can also be used for speculative decoding for inference acceleration. 

---

**Pre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency**

- We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the feasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model.  
- Through co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the communication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, nearly achieving full computation-communication overlap.  
  This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the training costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead.  
- At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model. The subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours.

---

**Post-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1**

-   We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models, into standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3. Our pipeline elegantly incorporates the verification and reflection patterns of R1 into DeepSeek-V3 and notably improves its reasoning performance. Meanwhile, we also maintain a control over the output style and length of DeepSeek-V3.

## 5. Chat Website &amp; API Platform
You can chat with DeepSeek-V3 on DeepSeek&#039;s official website: [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com/sign_in)

We also provide OpenAI-Compatible API at DeepSeek Platform: [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)

## 6. How to Run Locally

DeepSeek-V3 can be deployed locally using the following hardware and open-source community software:

1. **DeepSeek-Infer Demo**: We provide a simple and lightweight demo for FP8 and BF16 inference.
2. **SGLang**: Fully support the DeepSeek-V3 model in both BF16 and FP8 inference modes, with Multi-Token Prediction [coming soon](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2591).
3. **LMDeploy**: Enables efficient FP8 and BF16 inference for local and cloud deployment.
4. **TensorRT-LLM**: Currently supports BF16 inference and INT4/8 quantization, with FP8 support coming soon.
5. **vLLM**: Support DeepSeek-V3 model with FP8 and BF16 modes for tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism.
6. **LightLLM**: Supports efficient single-node or multi-node deployment for FP8 and BF16.
7. **AMD GPU**: Enables running the DeepSeek-V3 model on AMD GPUs via SGLang in both BF16 and FP8 modes.
8. **Huawei Ascend NPU**: Supports running DeepSeek-V3 on Huawei Ascend devices in both INT8 and BF16.

Since FP8 training is natively adopted in our framework, we only provide FP8 weights. If you require BF16 weights for experimentation, you can use the provided conversion script to perform the transformation.

Here is an example of converting FP8 weights to BF16:

```shell
cd inference
python fp8_cast_bf16.py --input-fp8-hf-path /path/to/fp8_weights --output-bf16-hf-path /path/to/bf16_weights
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Hugging Face&#039;s Transformers has not been directly supported yet.

### 6.1 Inference with DeepSeek-Infer Demo (example only)

#### System Requirements

&gt; [!NOTE] 
&gt; Linux with Python 3.10 only. Mac and Windows are not supported.

Dependencies:
```pip-requirements
torch==2.4.1
triton==3.0.0
transformers==4.46.3
safetensors==0.4.5
```
#### Model Weights &amp; Demo Code Preparation

First, clone our DeepSeek-V3 GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.git
```

Navigate to the `inference` folder and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Easiest way is to use a package manager like `conda` or `uv` to create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```shell
cd DeepSeek-V3/inference
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the model weights from Hugging Face, and put them into `/path/to/DeepSeek-V3` folder.

#### Model Weights Conversion

Convert Hugging Face model weights to a specific format:

```shell
python convert.py --hf-ckpt-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3 --save-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3-Demo --n-experts 256 --model-parallel 16
```

#### Run

Then you can chat with DeepSeek-V3:

```shell
torchrun --nnodes 2 --nproc-per-node 8 --node-rank $RANK --master-addr $ADDR generate.py --ckpt-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3-Demo --config configs/config_671B.json --interactive --temperature 0.7 --max-new-tokens 200
```

Or batch inference on a given file:

```shell
torchrun --nnodes 2 --nproc-per-node 8 --node-rank $RANK --master-addr $ADDR generate.py --ckpt-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3-Demo --config configs/config_671B.json --input-file $FILE
```

OpenSandbox is a **general-purpose sandbox platform** for AI applications, offering multi-language SDKs, unified sandbox APIs, and Docker/Kubernetes runtimes for scenarios like Coding Agents, GUI Agents, Agent Evaluation, AI Code Execution, and RL Training.

## Features

- **Multi-language SDKs**: Client SDKs for Python, Java/Kotlin, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Sandbox Protocol**: Defines sandbox lifecycle management APIs and sandbox execution APIs so you can extend custom sandbox runtimes.
- **Sandbox Runtime**: Built-in lifecycle management supporting Docker and [high-performance Kubernetes runtime](./kubernetes), enabling both local runs and large-scale distributed scheduling.
- **Sandbox Environments**: Built-in Command, Filesystem, and Code Interpreter implementations. Examples cover Coding Agents (e.g., Claude Code), browser automation (Chrome, Playwright), and desktop environments (VNC, VS Code).
- **Network Policy**: Unified [Ingress Gateway](components/ingress) with multiple routing strategies plus per-sandbox [egress controls](components/egress).

## Examples

### Basic Sandbox Operations

Requirements:

- Docker (required for local execution)
- Python 3.10+ (recommended for examples and local runtime)

#### 1. Install and Configure the Sandbox Server

```bash
uv pip install opensandbox-server
opensandbox-server init-config ~/.sandbox.toml --example docker
```

&gt; If you prefer working from source, you can still clone the repo for development, but server startup no longer requires it.
&gt;
&gt; ```bash
&gt; git clone https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox.git
&gt; cd OpenSandbox/server
&gt; uv sync
&gt; cp example.config.toml ~/.sandbox.toml # Copy configuration file
&gt; uv run python -m src.main # Start the service
&gt; ```

#### 2. Start the Sandbox Server

```bash
opensandbox-server

# Show help
opensandbox-server -h
```

#### 3. Create a Code Interpreter and Execute Commands

Install the Code Interpreter SDK

```bash
uv pip install opensandbox-code-interpreter
```

Create a sandbox and execute commands

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import timedelta

from code_interpreter import CodeInterpreter, SupportedLanguage
from opensandbox import Sandbox
from opensandbox.models import WriteEntry

async def main() -&gt; None:
    # 1. Create a sandbox
    sandbox = await Sandbox.create(
        &quot;opensandbox/code-interpreter:v1.0.1&quot;,
        entrypoint=[&quot;/opt/opensandbox/code-interpreter.sh&quot;],
        env={&quot;PYTHON_VERSION&quot;: &quot;3.11&quot;},
        timeout=timedelta(minutes=10),
    )

    async with sandbox:

        # 2. Execute a shell command
        execution = await sandbox.commands.run(&quot;echo &#039;Hello OpenSandbox!&#039;&quot;)
        print(execution.logs.stdout[0].text)

        # 3. Write a file
        await sandbox.files.write_files([
            WriteEntry(path=&quot;/tmp/hello.txt&quot;, data=&quot;Hello World&quot;, mode=644)
        ])

        # 4. Read a file
        content = await sandbox.files.read_file(&quot;/tmp/hello.txt&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Content: {content}&quot;) # Content: Hello World

        # 5. Create a code interpreter
        interpreter = await CodeInterpreter.create(sandbox)

        # 6. Execute Python code (single-run, pass language directly)
        result = await interpreter.codes.run(
              &quot;&quot;&quot;
                  import sys
                  print(sys.version)
                  result = 2 + 2
                  result
              &quot;&quot;&quot;,
              language=SupportedLanguage.PYTHON,
        )

        print(result.result[0].text) # 4
        print(result.logs.stdout[0].text) # 3.11.14

    # 7. Cleanup the sandbox
    await sandbox.kill()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

    The smallest vector index in the world. RAG Everything with LEANN!
&lt;/h2&gt;

LEANN is an innovative vector database that democratizes personal AI. Transform your laptop into a powerful RAG system that can index and search through millions of documents while using **97% less storage** than traditional solutions **without accuracy loss**.


LEANN achieves this through *graph-based selective recomputation* with *high-degree preserving pruning*, computing embeddings on-demand instead of storing them all. [Illustration Fig →](#️-architecture--how-it-works) | [Paper →](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08276)

**Ready to RAG Everything?** Transform your laptop into a personal AI assistant that can semantic search your **[file system](#-personal-data-manager-process-any-documents-pdf-txt-md)**, **[emails](#-your-personal-email-secretary-rag-on-apple-mail)**, **[browser history](#-time-machine-for-the-web-rag-your-entire-browser-history)**, **[chat history](#-wechat-detective-unlock-your-golden-memories)** ([WeChat](#-wechat-detective-unlock-your-golden-memories), [iMessage](#-imessage-history-your-personal-conversation-archive)), **[agent memory](#-chatgpt-chat-history-your-personal-ai-conversation-archive)** ([ChatGPT](#-chatgpt-chat-history-your-personal-ai-conversation-archive), [Claude](#-claude-chat-history-your-personal-ai-conversation-archive)), **[live data](#mcp-integration-rag-on-live-data-from-any-platform)** ([Slack](#slack-messages-search-your-team-conversations), [Twitter](#-twitter-bookmarks-your-personal-tweet-library)), **[codebase](#-claude-code-integration-transform-your-development-workflow)**\* , or external knowledge bases (i.e., 60M documents) - all on your laptop, with zero cloud costs and complete privacy.


\* Claude Code only supports basic `grep`-style keyword search. **LEANN** is a drop-in **semantic search MCP service fully compatible with Claude Code**, unlocking intelligent retrieval without changing your workflow. 🔥 Check out [the easy setup →](packages/leann-mcp/README.md)



## Why LEANN?

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/effects.png&quot; alt=&quot;LEANN vs Traditional Vector DB Storage Comparison&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; **The numbers speak for themselves:** Index 60 million text chunks in just 6GB instead of 201GB. From emails to browser history, everything fits on your laptop. [See detailed benchmarks for different applications below ↓](#-storage-comparison)


🔒 **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your laptop. No OpenAI, no cloud, no &quot;terms of service&quot;.

🪶 **Lightweight:** Graph-based recomputation eliminates heavy embedding storage, while smart graph pruning and CSR format minimize graph storage overhead. Always less storage, less memory usage!

📦 **Portable:** Transfer your entire knowledge base between devices (even with others) with minimal cost - your personal AI memory travels with you.

📈 **Scalability:** Handle messy personal data that would crash traditional vector DBs, easily managing your growing personalized data and agent generated memory!

✨ **No Accuracy Loss:** Maintain the same search quality as heavyweight solutions while using 97% less storage.

## Installation

### 📦 Prerequisites: Install uv

[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods) first if you don&#039;t have it. Typically, you can install it with:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 🚀 Quick Install

Clone the repository to access all examples and try amazing applications,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN.git leann
cd leann
```

and install LEANN from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/leann/) to run them immediately:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install leann

# CPU-only (Linux): use the `cpu` extra (e.g. `leann[cpu]`)
```

&lt;!--
&gt; Low-resource? See &quot;Low-resource setups&quot; in the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration-guide.md#low-resource-setups). --&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;🔧 Build from Source (Recommended for development)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;



```bash
git clone https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN.git leann
cd leann
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**macOS:**

Note: DiskANN requires MacOS 13.3 or later.

```bash
brew install libomp boost protobuf zeromq pkgconf
uv sync --extra diskann
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

Note: On Ubuntu 20.04, you may need to build a newer Abseil and pin Protobuf (e.g., v3.20.x) for building DiskANN. See [Issue #30](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN/issues/30) for a step-by-step note.

You can manually install [Intel oneAPI MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) instead of `libmkl-full-dev` for DiskANN. You can also use `libopenblas-dev` for building HNSW only, by removing `--extra diskann` in the command below.

```bash
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y \
  libomp-dev libboost-all-dev protobuf-compiler libzmq3-dev \
  pkg-config libabsl-dev libaio-dev libprotobuf-dev \
  libmkl-full-dev

uv sync --extra diskann
```

**Linux (Arch Linux):**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu &amp;&amp; sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake pkgconf git gcc \
  boost boost-libs protobuf abseil-cpp libaio zeromq

# For MKL in DiskANN
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
cd paru-bin &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
paru -S intel-oneapi-mkl intel-oneapi-compiler
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

uv sync --extra diskann
```

**Linux (RHEL / CentOS Stream / Oracle / Rocky / AlmaLinux):**

See [Issue #50](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN/issues/50) for more details.

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall -y &quot;Development Tools&quot;
sudo dnf install -y libomp-devel boost-devel protobuf-compiler protobuf-devel \
  abseil-cpp-devel libaio-devel zeromq-devel pkgconf-pkg-config

# For MKL in DiskANN
sudo dnf install -y intel-oneapi-mkl intel-oneapi-mkl-devel \
  intel-oneapi-openmp || sudo dnf install -y intel-oneapi-compiler
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

uv sync --extra diskann
```

&lt;/details&gt;


## Quick Start

Our declarative API makes RAG as easy as writing a config file.

Check out [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yichuan-w/LEANN/blob/main/demo.ipynb)

```python
from leann import LeannBuilder, LeannSearcher, LeannChat
from pathlib import Path
INDEX_PATH = str(Path(&quot;./&quot;).resolve() / &quot;demo.leann&quot;)

# Build an index
builder = LeannBuilder(backend_name=&quot;hnsw&quot;)
builder.add_text(&quot;LEANN saves 97% storage compared to traditional vector databases.&quot;)
builder.add_text(&quot;Tung Tung Tung Sahur called—they need their banana‑crocodile hybrid back&quot;)
builder.build_index(INDEX_PATH)

# Search
searcher = LeannSearcher(INDEX_PATH)
results = searcher.search(&quot;fantastical AI-generated creatures&quot;, top_k=1)

# Chat with your data
chat = LeannChat(INDEX_PATH, llm_config={&quot;type&quot;: &quot;hf&quot;, &quot;model&quot;: &quot;Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B&quot;})
response = chat.ask(&quot;How much storage does LEANN save?&quot;, top_k=1)
```

## RAG on Everything!

LEANN supports RAG on various data sources including documents (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`), Apple Mail, Google Search History, WeChat, ChatGPT conversations, Claude conversations, iMessage conversations, and **live data from any platform through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** - including Slack, Twitter, and more.



### Generation Model Setup

#### LLM Backend

LEANN supports many LLM providers for text generation (HuggingFace, Ollama, Anthropic, and Any OpenAI compatible API).


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔑 OpenAI API Setup (Default)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

Make sure to use `--llm openai` flag when using the CLI.
You can also specify the model name with `--llm-model &lt;model-name&gt;` flag.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🛠️ Supported LLM &amp; Embedding Providers (via OpenAI Compatibility)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Thanks to the widespread adoption of the OpenAI API format, LEANN is compatible out-of-the-box with a vast array of LLM and embedding providers. Simply set the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables to connect to your preferred service.

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;xxx&quot;
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=&quot;http://localhost:1234/v1&quot; # base url of the provider
```

To use OpenAI compatible endpoint with the CLI interface:

If you are using it for text generation, make sure to use `--llm openai` flag and specify the model name with `--llm-model &lt;model-name&gt;` flag.

If you are using it for embedding, set the `--embedding-mode openai` flag and specify the model name with `--embedding-model &lt;MODEL&gt;`.

Below is a list of base URLs for common providers to get you started.


### 🖥️ Local Inference Engines (Recommended for full privacy)

| Provider         | Sample Base URL             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Ollama** | `http://localhost:11434/v1` |
| **LM Studio** | `http://localhost:1234/v1`  |

| **llama.cpp** | `http://localhost:8080/v1`  |
| **SGLang** | `http://localhost:30000/v1` |
| **LiteLLM** | `http://localhost:4000`     |

-----

### ☁️ Cloud Providers

&gt; **🚨 A Note on Privacy:** Before choosing a cloud provider, carefully review their privacy and data retention policies. Depending on their terms, your data may be used for their own purposes, including but not limited to human reviews and model training, which can lead to serious consequences if not handled properly.


| Provider         | Base URL                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI** | `https://api.openai.com/v1`                                |
| **OpenRouter** | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`                             |
| **Gemini** | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` |
| **x.AI (Grok)** | `https://api.x.ai/v1`                                      |
| **Groq AI** | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`                           |
| **DeepSeek** | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`                              |
| **SiliconFlow** | `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1`                            |
| **Zhipu (BigModel)** | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/`                |
| **Mistral AI** | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1`                                |
| **Anthropic** | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`                             |
| **Jina AI** (Embeddings) | `https://api.jina.ai/v1`                         |

&gt; **💡 Tip: Separate Embedding Provider**
&gt;
&gt; To use a different provider for embeddings (e.g., Jina AI) while using another for LLM, use `--embedding-api-base` and `--embedding-api-key`:
&gt; ```bash
&gt; leann build my-index --docs ./docs \
&gt;   --embedding-mode openai \
&gt;   --embedding-model jina-embeddings-v3 \
&gt;   --embedding-api-base https://api.jina.ai/v1 \
&gt;   --embedding-api-key $JINA_API_KEY
&gt; ```

If your provider isn&#039;t on this list, don&#039;t worry! Check their documentation for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint—chances are, it&#039;s OpenAI Compatible too!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔧 Ollama Setup (Recommended for full privacy)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

**macOS:**

First, [download Ollama for macOS](https://ollama.com/download/mac).

```bash
# Pull a lightweight model (recommended for consumer hardware)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

**Linux:**

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama service manually
ollama serve &amp;

# Pull a lightweight model (recommended for consumer hardware)

### 📄 Personal Data Manager: Process Any Documents (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`)!

Ask questions directly about your personal PDFs, documents, and any directory containing your files!

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;videos/paper_clear.gif&quot; alt=&quot;LEANN Document Search Demo&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

The example below asks a question about summarizing our paper (uses default data in `data/`, which is a directory with diverse data sources: two papers, Pride and Prejudice, and a Technical report about LLM in Huawei in Chinese), and this is the **easiest example** to run here:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate # Don&#039;t forget to activate the virtual environment
python -m apps.document_rag --query &quot;What are the main techniques LEANN explores?&quot;
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📋 Click to expand: Document-Specific Arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

#### Parameters
```bash
--data-dir DIR           # Directory containing documents to process (default: data)
--file-types .ext .ext   # Filter by specific file types (optional - all LlamaIndex supported types if omitted)
```

#### Example Commands
```bash
# Process all documents with larger chunks for academic papers
python -m apps.document_rag --data-dir &quot;~/Documents/Papers&quot; --chunk-size 1024

# Filter only markdown and Python files with smaller chunks
python -m apps.document_rag --data-dir &quot;./docs&quot; --chunk-size 256 --file-types .md .py

# Enable AST-aware chunking for code files
python -m apps.document_rag --enable-code-chunking --data-dir &quot;./my_project&quot;

# Or use the specialized code RAG for better code understanding
python -m apps.code_rag --repo-dir &quot;./my_codebase&quot; --query &quot;How does authentication work?&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

# Skills
Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that&#039;s creating documents with your company&#039;s brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization&#039;s specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

# About This Repository

This repository contains skills that demonstrate what&#039;s possible with Claude&#039;s skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We&#039;ve also included the document creation &amp; editing skills that power [Claude&#039;s document capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) under the hood in the [`skills/docx`](./skills/docx), [`skills/pdf`](./skills/pdf), [`skills/pptx`](./skills/pptx), and [`skills/xlsx`](./skills/xlsx) subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

## Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

# Try in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API

## Claude Code
You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
```

Then, to install a specific set of skills:
1. Select `Browse and install plugins`
2. Select `anthropic-agent-skills`
3. Select `document-skills` or `example-skills`
4. Select `Install now`

Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via:
```
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the `document-skills` plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: &quot;Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from `path/to/some-file.pdf`&quot;

## Claude.ai

These example skills are all already available to paid plans in Claude.ai. 

To use any skill from this repository or upload custom skills, follow the instructions in [Using skills in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude#h_a4222fa77b).

## Claude API

You can use Anthropic&#039;s pre-built skills, and upload custom skills, via the Claude API. See the [Skills API Quickstart](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide#creating-a-skill) for more.

# Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow. For more details, see [How to create custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).

# Partner Skills

Skills are a great way to teach Claude how to get better at using specific pieces of software. As we see awesome example skills from partners, we may highlight some of them here:

- **Notion** - [Notion Skills for Claude](https://www.notion.so/notiondevs/Notion-Skills-for-Claude-28da4445d27180c7af1df7d8615723d0)

# 切换到通义千问
VITE_LLM_PROVIDER=qwen
VITE_QWEN_API_KEY=your_key
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;遇到请求超时怎么办？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

1. 增加超时时间：`VITE_LLM_TIMEOUT=300000`
2. 使用代理：配置 `VITE_LLM_BASE_URL`
3. 切换到国内平台：通义千问、DeepSeek、智谱AI 等
4. 降低并发：`VITE_LLM_CONCURRENCY=1`
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;数据库模式如何选择？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

**本地模式（推荐）**：数据存储在浏览器 IndexedDB，开箱即用，隐私安全
```env
VITE_USE_LOCAL_DB=true
```

**云端模式**：数据存储在 Supabase，支持多设备同步
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```

**演示模式**：不配置任何数据库，数据不持久化
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;如何使用 Ollama 本地大模型？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
# 1. 安装 Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  # macOS/Linux
# Windows: 访问 https://ollama.com/download

# 2. 拉取模型
ollama pull llama3  # 或 codellama、qwen2.5、deepseek-coder

# 3. 配置 XCodeReviewer
# 在 .env 中设置：
VITE_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
VITE_LLM_MODEL=llama3
VITE_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1

推荐模型：`llama3`（综合）、`codellama`（代码专用）、`qwen2.5`（中文）
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;百度文心一言的 API Key 格式？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

百度需要同时提供 API Key 和 Secret Key，用冒号分隔：
```env
VITE_LLM_PROVIDER=baidu
VITE_BAIDU_API_KEY=your_api_key:your_secret_key
```
获取地址：https://console.bce.baidu.com/qianfan/
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;如何使用 API 中转站？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

许多用户使用 API 中转服务来访问 LLM（更稳定、更便宜）。配置方法：

1. 访问系统管理页面（`/admin`）
2. 在&quot;系统配置&quot;标签页中：
   - 选择 LLM 提供商（如 OpenAI）
   - **API 基础 URL**: 填入中转站地址（如 `https://your-proxy.com/v1`）
   - **API Key**: 填入中转站提供的密钥（而非官方密钥）
3. 保存并刷新页面

**注意**：
- 中转站 URL 通常以 `/v1` 结尾（OpenAI 兼容格式）
- 使用中转站的 API Key，不是官方的
- 确认中转站支持你选择的 AI 模型
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;如何备份本地数据库？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

本地数据存储在浏览器 IndexedDB 中：
- 在应用的&quot;系统管理&quot;页面导出为 JSON 文件
- 通过导入 JSON 文件恢复数据
- 注意：清除浏览器数据会删除所有本地数据
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;如何设置输出语言？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```env
VITE_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE=zh-CN  # 中文（默认）
VITE_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE=en-US  # 英文
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;如何配置多个平台并快速切换？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

在 `.env` 中预配置所有平台的 Key，切换时只需修改 `VITE_LLM_PROVIDER`：
```env
VITE_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini  # 当前使用的平台

# 预配置所有平台
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=key1
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=key2
VITE_QWEN_API_KEY=key3
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;如何查看系统日志和调试信息？&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

XCodeReviewer 内置了日志系统，记录核心操作和错误：

**查看日志**：
- 导航栏 -&gt; 系统日志
- 或访问：`http://localhost:5173/logs` (开发) / `http://localhost:8888/logs` (生产)

**记录内容**：
- ✅ 用户核心操作（创建项目、审计任务、修改配置等）
- ✅ API 请求失败和错误
- ✅ 控制台错误（自动捕获）
- ✅ 未处理的异常

**功能特性**：
- 日志筛选、搜索
- 导出日志（JSON/CSV）
- 错误详情查看

**手动记录用户操作**：
```typescript
import { logger, LogCategory } from &#039;@/shared/utils/logger&#039;;

// 记录用户操作
logger.logUserAction(&#039;创建项目&#039;, { projectName, projectType });
logger.logUserAction(&#039;开始审计&#039;, { taskId, fileCount });
```

&lt;/details&gt;

# 🚀 PR Agent - The Original Open-Source PR Reviewer.

 This repository contains the open-source PR Agent Project. 
 It is not the Qodo free tier.
 
Try the free version on our website.

PR-Agent is an open-source, AI-powered code review agent and a community-maintained legacy project of Qodo. It is distinct from Qodo’s primary AI code review offering, which provides a feature-rich, context-aware experience. Qodo now offers a free tier that integrates seamlessly with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps for high-quality automated reviews.

## Why Use PR-Agent?

### 🎯 Built for Real Development Teams

**Fast &amp; Affordable**: Each tool (`/review`, `/improve`, `/ask`) uses a single LLM call (~30 seconds, low cost)

**Handles Any PR Size**: Our [PR Compression strategy](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) effectively processes both small and large PRs

**Highly Customizable**: JSON-based prompting allows easy customization of review categories and behavior via [configuration files](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml)

**Platform Agnostic**: 
- **Git Providers**: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, Gitea
- **Deployment**: CLI, GitHub Actions, Docker, self-hosted, webhooks
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT, Claude, Deepseek, and more

**Open Source Benefits**:
- Full control over your data and infrastructure
- Customize prompts and behavior for your team&#039;s needs
- No vendor lock-in
- Community-driven development

## Try It Now

Try the GPT-5 powered PR-Agent instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@CodiumAI-Agent` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The agent will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:

```
@CodiumAI-Agent /review
```

and the agent will respond with a review of your PR.

Note that this is a promotional bot, suitable only for initial experimentation.
It does not have &#039;edit&#039; access to your repo, for example, so it cannot update the PR description or add labels (`@CodiumAI-Agent /describe` will publish PR description as a comment). In addition, the bot cannot be used on private repositories, as it does not have access to the files there.


## How It Works

The following diagram illustrates PR-Agent tools and their flow:

}
```

**配置补充说明:** 

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;1. 语音配置&lt;/summary&gt;

+ 添加 `&quot;speech_recognition&quot;: true` 将开启语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，该参数仅支持私聊 (注意由于语音消息无法匹配前缀，一旦开启将对所有语音自动回复，支持语音触发画图)；
+ 添加 `&quot;group_speech_recognition&quot;: true` 将开启群组语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，参数仅支持群聊 (会匹配group_chat_prefix和group_chat_keyword, 支持语音触发画图)；
+ 添加 `&quot;voice_reply_voice&quot;: true` 将开启语音回复语音（同时作用于私聊和群聊）
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;2. 其他配置&lt;/summary&gt;

+ `model`: 模型名称，Agent模式下推荐使用 `MiniMax-M2.5`、`glm-5`、`kimi-k2.5`、`qwen3.5-plus`、`claude-sonnet-4-6`、`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`，全部模型名称参考[common/const.py](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/common/const.py)文件
+ `character_desc`：普通对话模式下的机器人系统提示词。在Agent模式下该配置不生效，由工作空间中的文件内容构成。
+ `subscribe_msg`：订阅消息，公众号和企业微信channel中请填写，当被订阅时会自动回复， 可使用特殊占位符。目前支持的占位符有{trigger_prefix}，在程序中它会自动替换成bot的触发词。
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;3. LinkAI配置&lt;/summary&gt;

+ `use_linkai`: 是否使用LinkAI接口，默认关闭，设置为true后可对接LinkAI平台，使用知识库、工作流、插件等能力, 参考[接口文档](https://docs.link-ai.tech/platform/api/chat)
+ `linkai_api_key`: LinkAI Api Key，可在 [控制台](https://link-ai.tech/console/interface) 创建
+ `linkai_app_code`: LinkAI 应用或工作流的code，选填，普通对话模式中使用。
&lt;/details&gt;

注：全部配置项说明可在 [`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py) 文件中查看。

## 三、运行

### 1.本地运行

如果是个人计算机 **本地运行**，直接在项目根目录下执行：

```bash
python3 app.py         # windows环境下该命令通常为 python app.py
```

运行后默认会启动web服务，可通过访问 `http://localhost:9899/chat` 在网页端对话。

如果需要接入其他应用通道只需修改 `config.json` 配置文件中的 `channel_type` 参数，详情参考：[通道说明](#通道说明)。


### 2.服务器部署

在服务器中可使用 `nohup` 命令在后台运行程序：

```bash
nohup python3 app.py &amp; tail -f nohup.out
```

执行后程序运行于服务器后台，可通过 `ctrl+c` 关闭日志，不会影响后台程序的运行。使用 `ps -ef | grep app.py | grep -v grep` 命令可查看运行于后台的进程，如果想要重新启动程序可以先 `kill` 掉对应的进程。 日志关闭后如果想要再次打开只需输入 `tail -f nohup.out`。 

此外，项目的 `scripts` 目录下有一键运行、关闭程序的脚本供使用。 运行后默认channel为web，通过可以通过修改配置文件进行切换。


### 3.Docker部署

使用docker部署无需下载源码和安装依赖，只需要获取 `docker-compose.yml` 配置文件并启动容器即可。Agent模式下更推荐使用源码进行部署，以获得更多系统访问能力。

&gt; 前提是需要安装好 `docker` 及 `docker-compose`，安装成功后执行 `docker -v` 和 `docker-compose version` (或 `docker compose version`) 可查看到版本号。安装地址为 [docker官网](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 。

**(1) 下载 docker-compose.yml 文件**

```bash
wget https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/docker-compose.yml
```

下载完成后打开 `docker-compose.yml` 填写所需配置，例如 `CHANNEL_TYPE`、`OPEN_AI_API_KEY` 和等配置。

**(2) 启动容器**

在 `docker-compose.yml` 所在目录下执行以下命令启动容器：

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d         # 若docker-compose为 1.X 版本，则执行 `sudo  docker-compose up -d`
```

运行命令后，会自动取 [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat) 拉取最新release版本的镜像。当执行 `sudo docker ps` 能查看到 NAMES 为 chatgpt-on-wechat 的容器即表示运行成功。最后执行以下命令可查看容器的运行日志：

```bash
sudo docker logs -f chatgpt-on-wechat
```

**(3) 插件使用**

如果需要在docker容器中修改插件配置，可通过挂载的方式完成，将 [插件配置文件](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/plugins/config.json.template)
重命名为 `config.json`，放置于 `docker-compose.yml` 相同目录下，并在 `docker-compose.yml` 中的 `chatgpt-on-wechat` 部分下添加 `volumes` 映射:

```
volumes:
  - ./config.json:/app/plugins/config.json
```
**注**：使用docker方式部署的详细教程可以参考：[docker部署CoW项目](https://www.wangpc.cc/ai/docker-deploy-cow/)

## 🎬 Get Started

### 📝 Prerequisites

- CPU &gt;= 4 cores
- RAM &gt;= 16 GB
- Disk &gt;= 50 GB
- Docker &gt;= 24.0.0 &amp; Docker Compose &gt;= v2.26.1
- [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/): Required only if you intend to use the code executor (sandbox) feature of RAGFlow.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux), see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 🚀 Start up the server

1. Ensure `vm.max_map_count` &gt;= 262144:

   &gt; To check the value of `vm.max_map_count`:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; $ sysctl vm.max_map_count
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; Reset `vm.max_map_count` to a value at least 262144 if it is not.
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; # In this case, we set it to 262144:
   &gt; $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
   &gt; This change will be reset after a system reboot. To ensure your change remains permanent, add or update the
   &gt; `vm.max_map_count` value in **/etc/sysctl.conf** accordingly:
   &gt;
   &gt; ```bash
   &gt; vm.max_map_count=262144
   &gt; ```
   &gt;
2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   ```
3. Start up the server using the pre-built Docker images:

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; All Docker images are built for x86 platforms. We don&#039;t currently offer Docker images for ARM64.
&gt; If you are on an ARM64 platform, follow [this guide](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/build_docker_image) to build a Docker image compatible with your system.

&gt; The command below downloads the `v0.24.0` edition of the RAGFlow Docker image. See the following table for descriptions of different RAGFlow editions. To download a RAGFlow edition different from `v0.24.0`, update the `RAGFLOW_IMAGE` variable accordingly in **docker/.env** before using `docker compose` to start the server.

```bash
   $ cd ragflow/docker

   # git checkout v0.24.0
   # Optional: use a stable tag (see releases: https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/releases)
   # This step ensures the **entrypoint.sh** file in the code matches the Docker image version.

   # Use CPU for DeepDoc tasks:
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

   # To use GPU to accelerate DeepDoc tasks:
   # sed -i &#039;1i DEVICE=gpu&#039; .env
   # docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

&gt; Note: Prior to `v0.22.0`, we provided both images with embedding models and slim images without embedding models. Details as follows:

| RAGFlow image tag | Image size (GB) | Has embedding models? | Stable?        |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| v0.21.1           | &amp;approx;9       | ✔️                    | Stable release |
| v0.21.1-slim      | &amp;approx;2       | ❌                     | Stable release |

&gt; Starting with `v0.22.0`, we ship only the slim edition and no longer append the **-slim** suffix to the image tag.

4. Check the server status after having the server up and running:

   ```bash
   $ docker logs -f docker-ragflow-cpu-1
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ```bash

         ____   ___    ______ ______ __
        / __ \ /   |  / ____// ____// /____  _      __
       / /_/ // /| | / / __ / /_   / // __ \| | /| / /
      / _, _// ___ |/ /_/ // __/  / // /_/ /| |/ |/ /
     /_/ |_|/_/  |_|\____//_/    /_/ \____/ |__/|__/

    * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
   ```

   &gt; If you skip this confirmation step and directly log in to RAGFlow, your browser may prompt a `network abnormal`
   &gt; error because, at that moment, your RAGFlow may not be fully initialized.
   &gt;
5. In your web browser, enter the IP address of your server and log in to RAGFlow.

   &gt; With the default settings, you only need to enter `http://IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE` (**sans** port number) as the default
   &gt; HTTP serving port `80` can be omitted when using the default configurations.
   &gt;
6. In [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template), select the desired LLM factory in `user_default_llm` and update
   the `API_KEY` field with the corresponding API key.

   &gt; See [llm_api_key_setup](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/llm_api_key_setup) for more information.
   &gt;

   _The show is on!_

## 🔧 Configurations

When it comes to system configurations, you will need to manage the following files:

- [.env](./docker/.env): Keeps the fundamental setups for the system, such as `SVR_HTTP_PORT`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and
  `MINIO_PASSWORD`.
- [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template): Configures the back-end services. The environment variables in this file will be automatically populated when the Docker container starts. Any environment variables set within the Docker container will be available for use, allowing you to customize service behavior based on the deployment environment.
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml): The system relies on [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to start up.

&gt; The [./docker/README](./docker/README.md) file provides a detailed description of the environment settings and service
&gt; configurations which can be used as `${ENV_VARS}` in the [service_conf.yaml.template](./docker/service_conf.yaml.template) file.

To update the default HTTP serving port (80), go to [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) and change `80:80`
to `&lt;YOUR_SERVING_PORT&gt;:80`.

Updates to the above configurations require a reboot of all containers to take effect:

&gt; ```bash
&gt; $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
&gt; ```

### Switch doc engine from Elasticsearch to Infinity

RAGFlow uses Elasticsearch by default for storing full text and vectors. To switch to [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/), follow these steps:

1. Stop all running containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; `-v` will delete the docker container volumes, and the existing data will be cleared.

2. Set `DOC_ENGINE` in **docker/.env** to `infinity`.
3. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   $ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; Switching to Infinity on a Linux/arm64 machine is not yet officially supported.

## 🔧 Build a Docker image

This image is approximately 2 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

Or if you are behind a proxy, you can pass proxy arguments:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --build-arg http_proxy=http://YOUR_PROXY:PORT \
  --build-arg https_proxy=http://YOUR_PROXY:PORT \
  -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:nightly .
```

## 🔨 Launch service from source for development

1. Install `uv` and `pre-commit`, or skip this step if they are already installed:

   ```bash
   pipx install uv pre-commit
   ```
2. Clone the source code and install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
   cd ragflow/
   uv sync --python 3.12 # install RAGFlow dependent python modules
   uv run download_deps.py
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. Launch the dependent services (MinIO, Elasticsearch, Redis, and MySQL) using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-base.yml up -d
   ```

   Add the following line to `/etc/hosts` to resolve all hosts specified in **docker/.env** to `127.0.0.1`:

   ```
   127.0.0.1       es01 infinity mysql minio redis sandbox-executor-manager
   ```
4. If you cannot access HuggingFace, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable to use a mirror site:

   ```bash
   export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   ```
5. If your operating system does not have jemalloc, please install it as follows:

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libjemalloc-dev
   # CentOS
   sudo yum install jemalloc
   # OpenSUSE
   sudo zypper install jemalloc
   # macOS
   sudo brew install jemalloc
   ```
6. Launch backend service:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
   bash docker/launch_backend_service.sh
   ```
7. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```
8. Launch frontend service:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   _The following output confirms a successful launch of the system:_

   ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0daf462c-a24d-4496-a66f-92533534e187)
9. Stop RAGFlow front-end and back-end service after development is complete:

   ```bash
   pkill -f &quot;ragflow_server.py|task_executor.py&quot;
   ```

## quickstart

just run **[copyparty-sfx.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty-sfx.py)** -- that&#039;s it! 🎉

&gt; ℹ️ the sfx is a [self-extractor](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/issues/270) which unpacks an embedded `tar.gz` into `$TEMP` -- if this looks too scary, you can use the [zipapp](#zipapp) which has slightly worse performance

* or install through [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/copyparty/): `python3 -m pip install --user -U copyparty`
* or if you cannot install python, you can use [copyparty.exe](#copypartyexe) instead
* or install [on arch](#arch-package) / [homebrew](#homebrew-formulae) ╱ [on NixOS](#nixos-module) ╱ [through nix](#nix-package)
* or if you are on android, [install copyparty in termux](#install-on-android)
* or maybe an iPhone or iPad? [install in a-Shell on iOS](#install-on-iOS)
* or maybe you have a [synology nas / dsm](./docs/synology-dsm.md)
* or if you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, run `uv tool run copyparty`
* or if your computer is messed up and nothing else works, [try the pyz](#zipapp)
* or if your OS is dead, give the [bootable flashdrive / cd-rom](https://a.ocv.me/pub/stuff/edcd001/enterprise-edition/) a spin
* or if you don&#039;t trust copyparty yet and want to isolate it a little, then...
  * ...maybe [prisonparty](./bin/prisonparty.sh) to create a tiny [chroot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chroot) (very portable),
  * ...or [bubbleparty](./bin/bubbleparty.sh) to wrap it in [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (much better)
* or if you prefer to [use docker](./scripts/docker/) 🐋 you can do that too
  * docker has all deps built-in, so skip this step:

enable thumbnails (images/audio/video), media indexing, and audio transcoding by installing some recommended deps:

* **Alpine:** `apk add py3-pillow ffmpeg`
* **Debian:** `apt install --no-install-recommends python3-pil ffmpeg`
* **Fedora:** rpmfusion + `dnf install python3-pillow ffmpeg --allowerasing`
* **FreeBSD:** `pkg install py39-sqlite3 py39-pillow ffmpeg`
* **MacOS:** `port install py-Pillow ffmpeg`
* **MacOS** (alternative): `brew install pillow ffmpeg`
* **Windows:** `python -m pip install --user -U Pillow`
  * install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and [ffmpeg](#optional-dependencies) manually; do not use `winget` or `Microsoft Store` (it breaks $PATH)
  * copyparty.exe comes with `Pillow` and only needs [ffmpeg](#optional-dependencies) for mediatags/videothumbs
* see [optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies) to enable even more features

running copyparty without arguments (for example doubleclicking it on Windows) will give everyone read/write access to the current folder; you may want [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes)

or see [some usage examples](#complete-examples) for inspiration, or the [complete windows example](./docs/examples/windows.md)

some recommended options:
* `-e2dsa` enables general [file indexing](#file-indexing)
* `-e2ts` enables audio metadata indexing (needs either FFprobe or Mutagen)
* `-v /mnt/music:/music:r:rw,foo -a foo:bar` shares `/mnt/music` as `/music`, `r`eadable by anyone, and read-write for user `foo`, password `bar`
  * replace `:r:rw,foo` with `:r,foo` to only make the folder readable by `foo` and nobody else
  * see [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes) (or [`--help-accounts`](https://copyparty.eu/cli/#accounts-help-page)) for the syntax and other permissions


### mirrors

other places to download copyparty from  (non-github links):

* https://copyparty.eu/ (hetzner, finland, official mirror):
  * https://copyparty.eu/py = https://copyparty.eu/copyparty-sfx.py = the sfx
  * https://copyparty.eu/en = https://copyparty.eu/copyparty-en.py = the english-only sfx
  * https://copyparty.eu/pyz = https://copyparty.eu/copyparty.pyz = the zipapp
  * https://copyparty.eu/enz = https://copyparty.eu/copyparty-en.pyz = the enterprise pyz
  * https://copyparty.eu/cli = online cli helptext


### at home

make it accessible over the internet  by starting a [cloudflare quicktunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) like so:

first download [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) and then start the tunnel with `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3923`

as the tunnel starts, it will show a URL which you can share to let anyone browse your stash or upload files to you

but if you have a domain, then you probably want to skip the random autogenerated URL and instead make a [permanent cloudflare tunnel](#permanent-cloudflare-tunnel)

since people will be connecting through cloudflare, run copyparty with `--xff-hdr cf-connecting-ip` to detect client IPs correctly


### on servers

you may also want these, especially on servers:

* [contrib/systemd/copyparty.service](contrib/systemd/copyparty.service) to run copyparty as a systemd service (see guide inside)
* [contrib/systemd/prisonparty.service](contrib/systemd/prisonparty.service) to run it in a chroot (for extra security)
* [contrib/podman-systemd/](contrib/podman-systemd/) to run copyparty in a Podman container as a systemd service (see guide inside)
* [contrib/openrc/copyparty](contrib/openrc/copyparty) to run copyparty on Alpine / Gentoo
* [contrib/rc/copyparty](contrib/rc/copyparty) to run copyparty on FreeBSD
* [nixos module](#nixos-module) to run copyparty on NixOS hosts
* [contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf](contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf) to [reverse-proxy](#reverse-proxy) behind nginx (for better https)

and remember to open the ports you want; here&#039;s a complete example including every feature copyparty has to offer:
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={80,443,3921,3922,3923,3945,3990}/tcp  # --zone=libvirt
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=12000-12099/tcp  # --zone=libvirt
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={69,1900,3969,5353}/udp  # --zone=libvirt
firewall-cmd --reload
```
(69:tftp, 1900:ssdp, 3921:ftp, 3922:sftp, 3923:http/https, 3945:smb, 3969:tftp, 3990:ftps, 5353:mdns, 12000:passive-ftp)

# Performance Benchmarking

For our latest performance benchmarking results, please refer to [NVIDIA Megatron Bridge Performance Summary](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/megatron-bridge/latest/performance-summary.html).

Our codebase efficiently trains models from 2B to 462B parameters across thousands of GPUs, achieving up to **47% Model FLOP Utilization (MFU)** on H100 clusters.

![Model table](images/model_table.png)

**Benchmark Configuration:**

- **Vocabulary size**: 131,072 tokens
- **Sequence length**: 4096 tokens
- **Model scaling**: Varied hidden size, attention heads, and layers to achieve target parameter counts
- **Communication optimizations**: Fine-grained overlapping with DP (`--overlap-grad-reduce`, `--overlap-param-gather`), TP (`--tp-comm-overlap`), and PP (enabled by default)

**Key Results:**

- **6144 H100 GPUs**: Successfully benchmarked 462B parameter model training
- **Superlinear scaling**: MFU increases from 41% to 47-48% with model size
- **End-to-end measurement**: Throughputs include all operations (data loading, optimizer steps, communication, logging)
- **Production ready**: Full training pipeline with checkpointing and fault tolerance
- *Note: Performance results measured without training to convergence*

## Weak Scaling Results

Our weak scaled results show superlinear scaling (MFU increases from 41% for the smallest model considered to 47-48% for the largest models); this is because larger GEMMs have higher arithmetic intensity and are consequently more efficient to execute.

![Weak scaling](images/weak_scaling.png)

## Strong Scaling Results

We also strong scaled the standard GPT-3 model (our version has slightly more than 175 billion parameters due to larger vocabulary size) from 96 H100 GPUs to 4608 GPUs, using the same batch size of 1152 sequences throughout. Communication becomes more exposed at larger scale, leading to a reduction in MFU from 47% to 42%.

Kimi Code CLI is an AI agent that runs in the terminal, helping you complete software development tasks and terminal operations. It can read and edit code, execute shell commands, search and fetch web pages, and autonomously plan and adjust actions during execution.

## Getting Started

See [Getting Started](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-cli/en/guides/getting-started.html) for how to install and start using Kimi Code CLI.

## Key Features

### Shell command mode

Kimi Code CLI is not only a coding agent, but also a shell. You can switch the shell command mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`. In this mode, you can directly run shell commands without leaving Kimi Code CLI.

![](./docs/media/shell-mode.gif)

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Built-in shell commands like `cd` are not supported yet.

### VS Code extension

Kimi Code CLI can be integrated with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) via the [Kimi Code VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moonshot-ai.kimi-code).

![VS Code Extension](./docs/media/vscode.png)

### IDE integration via ACP

Kimi Code CLI supports [Agent Client Protocol] out of the box. You can use it together with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE.

[Agent Client Protocol]: https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol

To use Kimi Code CLI with ACP clients, make sure to run Kimi Code CLI in the terminal and send `/login` to complete the login first. Then, you can configure your ACP client to start Kimi Code CLI as an ACP agent server with command `kimi acp`.

For example, to use Kimi Code CLI with [Zed](https://zed.dev/) or [JetBrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/12/bring-your-own-ai-agent-to-jetbrains-ides/), add the following configuration to your `~/.config/zed/settings.json` or `~/.jetbrains/acp.json` file:

```json
{
  &quot;agent_servers&quot;: {
    &quot;Kimi Code CLI&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;kimi&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;acp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can create Kimi Code CLI threads in IDE&#039;s agent panel.

![](./docs/media/acp-integration.gif)

### Zsh integration

You can use Kimi Code CLI together with Zsh, to empower your shell experience with AI agent capabilities.

Install the [zsh-kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli) plugin via:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you are using a plugin manager other than Oh My Zsh, you may need to refer to the plugin&#039;s README for installation instructions.

Then add `kimi-cli` to your Zsh plugin list in `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
plugins=(... kimi-cli)
```

After restarting Zsh, you can switch to agent mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`.

### MCP support

Kimi Code CLI supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

**`kimi mcp` sub-command group**

You can manage MCP servers with `kimi mcp` sub-command group. For example:

```sh
# Add streamable HTTP server:
kimi mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp --header &quot;CONTEXT7_API_KEY: ctx7sk-your-key&quot;

# Add streamable HTTP server with OAuth authorization:
kimi mcp add --transport http --auth oauth linear https://mcp.linear.app/mcp

# Add stdio server:
kimi mcp add --transport stdio chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest

# List added MCP servers:
kimi mcp list

# Remove an MCP server:
kimi mcp remove chrome-devtools

# Authorize an MCP server:
kimi mcp auth linear
```

**Ad-hoc MCP configuration**

Kimi Code CLI also supports ad-hoc MCP server configuration via CLI option.

Given an MCP config file in the well-known MCP config format like the following:

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;context7&quot;: {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://mcp.context7.com/mcp&quot;,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;CONTEXT7_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;YOUR_API_KEY&quot;
      }
    },
    &quot;chrome-devtools&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;chrome-devtools-mcp@latest&quot;]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `kimi` with `--mcp-config-file` option to connect to the specified MCP servers:

```sh
kimi --mcp-config-file /path/to/mcp.json
```
