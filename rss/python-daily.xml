# Pathway&lt;a id=&quot;pathway&quot;&gt; Live Data Framework&lt;/a&gt;

[Pathway](https://pathway.com) is a Python ETL framework for stream processing, real-time analytics, LLM pipelines, and RAG.

Pathway comes with an **easy-to-use Python API**, allowing you to seamlessly integrate your favorite Python ML libraries.
Pathway code is versatile and robust: **you can use it in both development and production environments, handling both batch and streaming data effectively**.
The same code can be used for local development, CI/CD tests, running batch jobs, handling stream replays, and processing data streams.

Pathway is powered by a **scalable Rust engine** based on Differential Dataflow and performs incremental computation.
Your Pathway code, despite being written in Python, is run by the Rust engine, enabling multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations.
All the pipeline is kept in memory and can be easily deployed with **Docker and Kubernetes**.

You can install Pathway with pip:
```
pip install -U pathway
```

For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project [on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pathway).

### Event processing and real-time analytics pipelines
With its unified engine for batch and streaming and its full Python compatibility, Pathway makes data processing as easy as possible. It&#039;s the ideal solution for a wide range of data processing pipelines, including:

- [Showcase: Real-time ETL.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/kafka-etl)
- [Showcase: Event-driven pipelines with alerting.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/realtime-log-monitoring)
- [Showcase: Realtime analytics.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/linear_regression_with_kafka)
- [Docs: Switch from batch to streaming.](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/connecting-to-data/switch-from-batch-to-streaming)



### AI Pipelines

Pathway provides dedicated LLM tooling to build live LLM and RAG pipelines. Wrappers for most common LLM services and utilities are included, making working with LLMs and RAGs pipelines incredibly easy. Check out our [LLM xpack documentation](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/overview).

Don&#039;t hesitate to try one of our runnable examples featuring LLM tooling.
You can find such examples [here](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/llm-examples).

  - [Template: Unstructured data to SQL on-the-fly.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/unstructured-to-structured)
  - [Template: Private RAG with Ollama and Mistral AI](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/private-rag-ollama-mistral)
  - [Template: Adaptive RAG](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/adaptive-rag)
  - [Template: Multimodal RAG with gpt-4o](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/multimodal-rag)

## Features

- **A wide range of connectors**: Pathway comes with connectors that connect to external data sources such as Kafka, GDrive, PostgreSQL, or SharePoint. Its Airbyte connector allows you to connect to more than 300 different data sources. If the connector you want is not available, you can build your own custom connector using Pathway Python connector.
- **Stateless and stateful transformations**: Pathway supports stateful transformations such as joins, windowing, and sorting. It provides many transformations directly implemented in Rust. In addition to the provided transformation, you can use any Python function. You can implement your own or you can use any Python library to process your data.
- **Persistence**: Pathway provides persistence to save the state of the computation. This allows you to restart your pipeline after an update or a crash. Your pipelines are in good hands with Pathway!
- **Consistency**: Pathway handles the time for you, making sure all your computations are consistent. In particular, Pathway manages late and out-of-order points by updating its results whenever new (or late, in this case) data points come into the system. The free version of Pathway gives the &quot;at least once&quot; consistency while the enterprise version provides the &quot;exactly once&quot; consistency.
- **Scalable Rust engine**: with Pathway Rust engine, you are free from the usual limits imposed by Python. You can easily do multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations.
- **LLM helpers**: Pathway provides an LLM extension with all the utilities to integrate LLMs with your data pipelines (LLM wrappers, parsers, embedders, splitters), including an in-memory real-time Vector Index, and integrations with LLamaIndex and LangChain. You can quickly build and deploy RAG applications with your live documents.


## Getting started&lt;a id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Installation&lt;a id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.

You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:

```
$ pip install -U pathway
```

⚠️ Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.


### Example: computing the sum of positive values in real time.&lt;a id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

```python
import pathway as pw

# Define the schema of your data (Optional)
class InputSchema(pw.Schema):
  value: int

# Connect to your data using connectors
input_table = pw.io.csv.read(
  &quot;./input/&quot;,
  schema=InputSchema
)

#Define your operations on the data
filtered_table = input_table.filter(input_table.value&gt;=0)
result_table = filtered_table.reduce(
  sum_value = pw.reducers.sum(filtered_table.value)
)

# Load your results to external systems
pw.io.jsonlines.write(result_table, &quot;output.jsonl&quot;)

# Run the computation
pw.run()
```

Run Pathway [in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aBIJ2HCng-YEUOMrr0qtj0NeZMEyRz55?usp=sharing).

You can find more examples [here](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/tree/main/examples).


## Deployment&lt;a id=&quot;deployment&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

### Locally&lt;a id=&quot;running-pathway-locally&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

To use Pathway, you only need to import it:

```python
import pathway as pw
```

Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:

```python
pw.run()
```

You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`.
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 

&lt;img src=&quot;https://d14l3brkh44201.cloudfront.net/pathway-dashboard.png&quot; width=&quot;1326&quot; alt=&quot;Pathway dashboard&quot;/&gt;

Alternatively, you can use the pathway&#039;ish version:

```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```

Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```

To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/pathwaycom/cookiecutter-pathway).


### Docker&lt;a id=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You can easily run Pathway using docker.

#### Pathway image

You can use the [Pathway docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pathwaycom/pathway), using a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM pathwaycom/pathway:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ &quot;python&quot;, &quot;./your-script.py&quot; ]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t my-pathway-app .
docker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app my-pathway-app
```

#### Run a single Python script

When dealing with single-file projects, creating a full-fledged `Dockerfile`
might seem unnecessary. In such scenarios, you can execute a
Python script directly using the Pathway Docker image. For example:

```console
docker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app -v &quot;$PWD&quot;:/app pathwaycom/pathway:latest python my-pathway-app.py
```

#### Python docker image

You can also use a standard Python image and install Pathway using pip with a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/x86_64 python:3.10

RUN pip install -U pathway
COPY ./pathway-script.py pathway-script.py

CMD [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;-u&quot;, &quot;pathway-script.py&quot;]
```

### Kubernetes and cloud&lt;a id=&quot;k8s&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Docker containers are ideally suited for deployment on the cloud with Kubernetes.
If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.
Pathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.
It scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports distributed Kubernetes deployment, with external persistence setup.

You can easily deploy Pathway using services like Render: see [how to deploy Pathway in a few clicks](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/deployment/render-deploy/).

If you are interested, don&#039;t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@pathway.com) to learn more.

## Performance&lt;a id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF&#039;s in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).

If you are curious, here are [some benchmarks to play with](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks).

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks/raw/main/images/bm-wordcount-lineplot.png&quot; width=&quot;1326&quot; alt=&quot;WordCount Graph&quot;/&gt;

## Documentation and Support&lt;a id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The entire documentation of Pathway is available at [pathway.com/developers/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/introduction/welcome), including the [API Docs](https://pathway.com/developers/api-docs/pathway).

&gt; # It seems that the last few Windows Updates released on many/all of the update channels (issue started from July) are breaking WSA installations for many users! 
&gt;
&gt; - ## If you are affected by the issue, try these current workarounds:
&gt;   - ### RECOMMENDED FIX: https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues/593#issuecomment-3172749449
&gt;   - #### Switch/Use the builds which do not contain GApps. These are the builds that contain ``NoGApps`` in their .7z archive names. 
&gt;   - #### Really old builds of WSA (2211/2210) are known to be working.  
&gt;
&gt; ## Refer to https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/issues/593 for more information.

## About

OWASP Nest was **originally created by Arkadii Yakovets** (Ark) to address challenges in navigating OWASP projects. The project was **built from scratch based on Ark&#039;s ideas and discussions with Starr Brown** (Starr), ensuring a well-structured system design aligned with OWASP&#039;s ecosystem. Ark, an experienced software development professional with over 10 years of expertise in Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), and related backend technologies, led the development of the backend using widely adopted Python **open-source frameworks and libraries**, including DRF, django-filter, OpenAI, Algolia Search, slack-bolt, PyGitHub, pre-commit, pytest, and more. The initial frontend, based on Vue.js, was introduced by **Kateryna Golovanova** (Kate), who later became the project co-leader due to her invaluable frontend and project management skills. The **code is licensed under the MIT License**, encouraging contributions while protecting the authors from legal claims. All OWASP Nest leaders are OWASP members and adhere to the OWASP Code of Conduct.

Over time, OWASP Nest has expanded to address broader OWASP community needs, such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student guidance and contribution opportunities discovery. The platform, along with NestBot, has become a popular entry point for various OWASP aspects, including projects, chapters, users, and aggregated contribution opportunities -- with even more features planned. OWASP Nest&#039;s success is also the result of many valuable [contributions](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/graphs/contributors) from the broader [OWASP Nest community](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/project-nest), whose efforts have helped shape and improve the project in countless ways.

**No other OWASP projects&#039; code was used in OWASP Nest&#039;s development.** While explicit attribution (other than per MIT license) is not required, contributors and other OWASP project leaders are welcome to provide it at their discretion.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure your transformers&gt;=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)

2. Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

### Qwen-Image-2512 (for Text to Image generation, better character realism/texture quality)

We recommand use the latest prompt enhancing tools for Qwen-Image-2512, please check `src/examples/tools/prompt_utils_2512.py`

```python
from diffusers import QwenImagePipeline
import torch
# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = &quot;cuda&quot;
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = &quot;cpu&quot;

pipe = QwenImagePipeline.from_pretrained(&quot;Qwen/Qwen-Image-2512&quot;, torch_dtype=torch_dtype).to(device)

# Generate image
prompt = &#039;&#039;&#039;A 20-year-old East Asian girl with delicate, charming features and large, bright brown eyes—expressive and lively, with a cheerful or subtly smiling expression. Her naturally wavy long hair is either loose or tied in twin ponytails. She has fair skin and light makeup accentuating her youthful freshness. She wears a modern, cute dress or relaxed outfit in bright, soft colors—lightweight fabric, minimalist cut. She stands indoors at an anime convention, surrounded by banners, posters, or stalls. Lighting is typical indoor illumination—no staged lighting—and the image resembles a casual iPhone snapshot: unpretentious composition, yet brimming with vivid, fresh, youthful charm.&#039;&#039;&#039;

negative_prompt = &quot;低分辨率，低画质，肢体畸形，手指畸形，画面过饱和，蜡像感，人脸无细节，过度光滑，画面具有AI感。构图混乱。文字模糊，扭曲。&quot;


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    &quot;1:1&quot;: (1328, 1328),
    &quot;16:9&quot;: (1664, 928),
    &quot;9:16&quot;: (928, 1664),
    &quot;4:3&quot;: (1472, 1104),
    &quot;3:4&quot;: (1104, 1472),
    &quot;3:2&quot;: (1584, 1056),
    &quot;2:3&quot;: (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios[&quot;16:9&quot;]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device=&quot;cuda&quot;).manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save(&quot;example.png&quot;)

```


### Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 (for Image Editing, Multiple Image Support and Improved Consistency)

```python
import os
import torch

### Qwen-Image (for Text-to-Image)

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = &quot;Qwen/Qwen-Image&quot;

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = &quot;cuda&quot;
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = &quot;cpu&quot;

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype).to(device)

positive_magic = {
    &quot;en&quot;: &quot;, Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.&quot;, # for english prompt
    &quot;zh&quot;: &quot;, 超清，4K，电影级构图.&quot; # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = &#039;&#039;&#039;A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading &quot;Qwen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup,&quot; with a neon light beside it displaying &quot;通义千问&quot;. Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written &quot;π≈3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197&quot;.&#039;&#039;&#039;

negative_prompt = &quot; &quot; # Recommended if you don&#039;t use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    &quot;1:1&quot;: (1328, 1328),
    &quot;16:9&quot;: (1664, 928),
    &quot;9:16&quot;: (928, 1664),
    &quot;4:3&quot;: (1472, 1104),
    &quot;3:4&quot;: (1104, 1472),
    &quot;3:2&quot;: (1584, 1056),
    &quot;2:3&quot;: (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios[&quot;16:9&quot;]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic[&quot;en&quot;],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device=&quot;cuda&quot;).manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save(&quot;example.png&quot;)
```

### Qwen-Image-Edit (for Image Editing, Only Support Single Image Input)
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 has better consistency than Qwen-Image-Edit; it is recommended to use Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 directly，for both single image input and multiple image inputs.


```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained(&quot;Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit&quot;)
print(&quot;pipeline loaded&quot;)
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to(&quot;cuda&quot;)
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open(&quot;./input.png&quot;).convert(&quot;RGB&quot;)
prompt = &quot;Change the rabbit&#039;s color to purple, with a flash light background.&quot;


inputs = {
    &quot;image&quot;: image,
    &quot;prompt&quot;: prompt,
    &quot;generator&quot;: torch.manual_seed(0),
    &quot;true_cfg_scale&quot;: 4.0,
    &quot;negative_prompt&quot;: &quot; &quot;,
    &quot;num_inference_steps&quot;: 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save(&quot;output_image_edit.png&quot;)
    print(&quot;image saved at&quot;, os.path.abspath(&quot;output_image_edit.png&quot;))
```



&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; We have observed that editing results may become unstable if prompt rewriting is not used. Therefore, we strongly recommend applying prompt rewriting to improve the stability of editing tasks. For reference, please see our official [demo script](src/examples/tools/prompt_utils.py) or Advanced Usage below, which includes example system prompts. Qwen-Image-Edit is actively evolving with ongoing development. Stay tuned for future enhancements!



### Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 (for Image Editing, Multiple Image Support and Improved Consistency)

```python
import os
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import QwenImageEditPlusPipeline
from io import BytesIO
import requests

pipeline = QwenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained(&quot;Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509&quot;, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
print(&quot;pipeline loaded&quot;)

pipeline.to(&#039;cuda&#039;)
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)
image1 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(&quot;https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/edit2509_1.jpg&quot;).content))
image2 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(&quot;https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/edit2509_2.jpg&quot;).content))
prompt = &quot;The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square.&quot;
inputs = {
    &quot;image&quot;: [image1, image2],
    &quot;prompt&quot;: prompt,
    &quot;generator&quot;: torch.manual_seed(0),
    &quot;true_cfg_scale&quot;: 4.0,
    &quot;negative_prompt&quot;: &quot; &quot;,
    &quot;num_inference_steps&quot;: 40,
    &quot;guidance_scale&quot;: 1.0,
    &quot;num_images_per_prompt&quot;: 1,
}
with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save(&quot;output_image_edit_plus.png&quot;)
    print(&quot;image saved at&quot;, os.path.abspath(&quot;output_image_edit_plus.png&quot;))
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### Advanced Usage

#### Prompt Enhance for Text-to-Image
For enhanced prompt optimization and multi-language support, we recommend using our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-Plus .

You can integrate it directly into your code:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
prompt = rewrite(prompt)
```

Alternatively, run the example script from the command line:

```bash
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
```

#### Prompt Enhance for Image Edit
For enhanced stability, we recommend using our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-VL-Max.

You can integrate it directly into your code:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import polish_edit_prompt
prompt = polish_edit_prompt(prompt, pil_image)
```


## Deploy Qwen-Image

Qwen-Image supports Multi-GPU API Server for local deployment:

### Multi-GPU API Server Pipeline &amp; Usage

The Multi-GPU API Server will start a Gradio-based web interface with:
- Multi-GPU parallel processing
- Queue management for high concurrency
- Automatic prompt optimization
- Support for multiple aspect ratios

Configuration via environment variables:

### Showcase of Qwen-Image-2512
**Enhanced Huamn Realism**

In Qwen-Image-2512, human depiction has been substantially refined. Compared to the August release, Qwen-Image-2512 adds significantly richer facial details and better environmental context. For example:


&gt; A Chinese female college student, around 20 years old, with a very short haircut that conveys a gentle, artistic vibe. Her hair naturally falls to partially cover her cheeks, projecting a tomboyish yet charming demeanor. She has cool-toned fair skin and delicate features, with a slightly shy yet subtly confident expression—her mouth crooked in a playful, youthful smirk. She wears an off-shoulder top, revealing one shoulder, with a well-proportioned figure. The image is framed as a close-up selfie: she dominates the foreground, while the background clearly shows her dormitory—a neatly made bed with white linens on the top bunk, a tidy study desk with organized stationery, and wooden cabinets and drawers. The photo is captured on a smartphone under soft, even ambient lighting, with natural tones, high clarity, and a bright, lively atmosphere full of youthful, everyday energy.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/image2512/幻灯片1.JPG#center)

For the same prompt, Qwen-Image-2512 yields notably more lifelike facial features, and background objects—e.g., the desk, stationery, and bedding—are rendered with significantly greater clarity than in Qwen-Image.


&gt; A 20-year-old East Asian girl with delicate, charming features and large, bright brown eyes—expressive and lively, with a cheerful or subtly smiling expression. Her naturally wavy long hair is either loose or tied in twin ponytails. She has fair skin and light makeup accentuating her youthful freshness. She wears a modern, cute dress or relaxed outfit in bright, soft colors—lightweight fabric, minimalist cut. She stands indoors at an anime convention, surrounded by banners, posters, o

MONAI is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based, [open-source](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/dev/LICENSE) framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging, part of the [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).
Its ambitions are as follows:

- Developing a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating on a common foundation;
- Creating state-of-the-art, end-to-end training workflows for healthcare imaging;
- Providing researchers with the optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate deep learning models.

## Features

&gt; _Please see [the technical highlights](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/highlights.html) and [What&#039;s New](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html) of the milestone releases._

- flexible pre-processing for multi-dimensional medical imaging data;
- compositional &amp; portable APIs for ease of integration in existing workflows;
- domain-specific implementations for networks, losses, evaluation metrics and more;
- customizable design for varying user expertise;
- multi-GPU multi-node data parallelism support.

## Requirements

MONAI works with the [currently supported versions of Python](https://devguide.python.org/versions), and depends directly on NumPy and PyTorch with many optional dependencies.

* Major releases of MONAI will have dependency versions stated for them. The current state of the `dev` branch in this repository is the unreleased development version of MONAI which typically will support current versions of dependencies and include updates and bug fixes to do so.
* PyTorch support covers [the current version](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases) plus three previous minor versions. If compatibility issues with a PyTorch version and other dependencies arise, support for a version may be delayed until a major release.
* Our support policy for other dependencies adheres for the most part to [SPEC0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000), where dependency versions are supported where possible for up to two years. Discovered vulnerabilities or defects may require certain versions to be explicitly not supported.
* See the `requirements*.txt` files for dependency version information.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># whatsapp Msgstore Viewer
Free, open source and cross-platform app to decrypt, read and view the Whatsapp `msgstore.db` database.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/demo/demo_gif_2.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Features
* View contact and group chats.
* View call logs with their durations.
* Easy access to media files (images, audio, and video) from within the chat, if the local WhatsApp directory has been provided.
* Decrypt and view the database if you have the decryption `key` (Should support **crypt12**, **crypt14**, and **crypt15**).
* Cross-platform (Should work on Linux, Windows, and Mac)


# Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or later
```bash
git clone https://github.com/absadiki/whatsapp-msgstore-viewer
cd whatsapp-msgstore-viewer
pip install -e .
```

### Run
```bash
wmv
```

&gt; **Note for Ubuntu users:** Additional system dependencies might be needed. See [#19](https://github.com/absadiki/whatsapp-msgstore-viewer/issues/19) for details.

# Usage
To use the app, you will need:
* The `msgstore.db` (`msgstore.db.cryptX` if it is encrypted) database: It is a database where Whatsapp is storing all your messages.
* The `wa.db` database: It is a database where Whatsapp is storing contact names. It is optional, so if it is not provided you will just see phone numbers.
* The `WhatsApp directory`: The directory of WhatsApp in the local storage of your phone. This will be used to view the media files (Optional as well).
* The `key`: If your database is encrypted, you will need to provide the decryption key to decrypt it. The decrypted database will be stored in the same directory as your encrypted database with a `-decrypted.db` suffix.
  (See below for more information).

# Notes
#### Where to find the databases
Check out the great tutorial &quot;[Retrieving WhatsApp Databases](https://github.com/Dexter2389/whatsapp-backup-chat-viewer#retrieving-whatsapp-databases)&quot; by [@Dexter2389](https://github.com/Dexter2389).

#### About the decryption process
The app uses the [WhatsApp-Crypt14-Crypt15-Decrypter](https://github.com/ElDavoo/WhatsApp-Crypt14-Crypt15-Decrypter) by [ElDavoo](https://github.com/ElDavoo) under the hood.
Please check their repository if you face any issues with the decryption.

#### About the Database schema
This app is a reverse engineering attempt of the WhatsApp database and has been tested with my personal `msgstore.db` file. It might break if there are any updates to the `msgstore` database schema.

I&#039;ve made it easy to add support for more schemas (It&#039;s a simple SQLite exercise :D).

All contributions are welcome.

Follow these steps to add support for other schemas (see `db/v1/db.py` as an example):
* Create a package in the `dbs` package and give your schema a name (for example `v2`).
* Inside the newly created package, create a Python module `db.py`.
* Inherit the abstract class `AbstractDatabase` located in the `dbs/abstract_db.py` module.
* The app will dynamically load existing schemas when starting.
* Submit a pull request.

#### About different languages

  - You might encounter an issue where messages are displayed incorrectly (as square characters).
  This is likely a font issue. To resolve this, find a font that supports your language and specify its path in the `advanced settings` on the login screen.
  - For RTL languages, please see [RTL Support #8](https://github.com/absadiki/whatsapp-msgstore-viewer/discussions/8)

## What is Agents?

&lt;!--BEGIN_DESCRIPTION--&gt;

The Agent Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable participants
that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal voice
agents that can see, hear, and understand.

&lt;!--END_DESCRIPTION--&gt;

## Features

- **Flexible integrations**: A comprehensive ecosystem to mix and match the right STT, LLM, TTS, and Realtime API to suit your use case.
- **Integrated job scheduling**: Built-in task scheduling and distribution with [dispatch APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/dispatch/) to connect end users to agents.
- **Extensive WebRTC clients**: Build client applications using LiveKit&#039;s open-source SDK ecosystem, supporting all major platforms.
- **Telephony integration**: Works seamlessly with LiveKit&#039;s [telephony stack](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/), allowing your agent to make calls to or receive calls from phones.
- **Exchange data with clients**: Use [RPCs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/rpc/) and other [Data APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/) to seamlessly exchange data with clients.
- **Semantic turn detection**: Uses a transformer model to detect when a user is done with their turn, helps to reduce interruptions.
- **MCP support**: Native support for MCP. Integrate tools provided by MCP servers with one loc.
- **Builtin test framework**: Write tests and use judges to ensure your agent is performing as expected.
- **Open-source**: Fully open-source, allowing you to run the entire stack on your own servers, including [LiveKit server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit), one of the most widely used WebRTC media servers.

## Installation

To install the core Agents library, along with plugins for popular model providers:

```bash
pip install &quot;livekit-agents[openai,silero,deepgram,cartesia,turn-detector]~=1.0&quot;
```

## Docs and guides

Documentation on the framework and how to use it can be found [here](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/)

## Core concepts

- Agent: An LLM-based application with defined instructions.
- AgentSession: A container for agents that manages interactions with end users.
- entrypoint: The starting point for an interactive session, similar to a request handler in a web server.
- Worker: The main process that coordinates job scheduling and launches agents for user sessions.

## Usage

### Simple voice agent

---

```python
from livekit.agents import (
    Agent,
    AgentSession,
    JobContext,
    RunContext,
    WorkerOptions,
    cli,
    function_tool,
)
from livekit.plugins import silero

@function_tool
async def lookup_weather(
    context: RunContext,
    location: str,
):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Used to look up weather information.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    return {&quot;weather&quot;: &quot;sunny&quot;, &quot;temperature&quot;: 70}


async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    await ctx.connect()

    agent = Agent(
        instructions=&quot;You are a friendly voice assistant built by LiveKit.&quot;,
        tools=[lookup_weather],
    )
    session = AgentSession(
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
        # any combination of STT, LLM, TTS, or realtime API can be used
        stt=&quot;assemblyai/universal-streaming:en&quot;,
        llm=&quot;openai/gpt-4.1-mini&quot;,
        tts=&quot;cartesia/sonic-2:9626c31c-bec5-4cca-baa8-f8ba9e84c8bc&quot;,
    )

    await session.start(agent=agent, room=ctx.room)
    await session.generate_reply(instructions=&quot;greet the user and ask about their day&quot;)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    cli.run_app(WorkerOptions(entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint))
```

You&#039;ll need the following environment variables for this example:

- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ELEVEN_API_KEY

### Multi-agent handoff

---

This code snippet is abbreviated. For the full example, see [multi_agent.py](examples/voice_agents/multi_agent.py)

```python
...
class IntroAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions=f&quot;You are a story teller. Your goal is to gather a few pieces of information from the user to make the story personalized and engaging.&quot;
            &quot;Ask the user for their name and where they are from&quot;
        )

    async def on_enter(self):
        self.session.generate_reply(instructions=&quot;greet the user and gather information&quot;)

    @function_tool
    async def information_gathered(
        self,
        context: RunContext,
        name: str,
        location: str,
    ):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Called when the user has provided the information needed to make the story personalized and engaging.

        Args:
            name: The name of the user
            location: The location of the user
        &quot;&quot;&quot;

        context.userdata.name = name
        context.userdata.location = location

        story_agent = StoryAgent(name, location)
        return story_agent, &quot;Let&#039;s start the story!&quot;


class StoryAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name: str, location: str) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions=f&quot;You are a storyteller. Use the user&#039;s information in order to make the story personalized.&quot;
            f&quot;The user&#039;s name is {name}, from {location}&quot;
            # override the default model, switching to Realtime API from standard LLMs
            llm=openai.realtime.RealtimeModel(voice=&quot;echo&quot;),
            chat_ctx=chat_ctx,
        )

    async def on_enter(self):
        self.session.generate_reply()


async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    await ctx.connect()

    userdata = StoryData()
    session = AgentSession[StoryData](
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
        stt=&quot;deepgram/nova-3&quot;,
        llm=&quot;openai/gpt-4o&quot;,
        tts=&quot;cartesia/sonic-2:9626c31c-bec5-4cca-baa8-f8ba9e84c8bc&quot;,
        userdata=userdata,
    )

    await session.start(
        agent=IntroAgent(),
        room=ctx.room,
    )
...
```

### Testing

Automated tests are essential for building reliable agents, especially with the non-deterministic behavior of LLMs. LiveKit Agents include native test integration to help you create dependable agents.

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_no_availability() -&gt; None:
    llm = google.LLM()
    async AgentSession(llm=llm) as sess:
        await sess.start(MyAgent())
        result = await sess.run(
            user_input=&quot;Hello, I need to place an order.&quot;
        )
        result.expect.skip_next_event_if(type=&quot;message&quot;, role=&quot;assistant&quot;)
        result.expect.next_event().is_function_call(name=&quot;start_order&quot;)
        result.expect.next_event().is_function_call_output()
        await (
            result.expect.next_event()
            .is_message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;)
            .judge(llm, intent=&quot;assistant should be asking the user what they would like&quot;)
        )

```

## Running your agent

### Testing in terminal

```shell
python myagent.py console
```

Runs your agent in terminal mode, enabling local audio input and output for testing.
This mode doesn&#039;t require external servers or dependencies and is useful for quickly validating behavior.

### Developing with LiveKit clients

```shell
python myagent.py dev
```

Starts the agent server and enables hot reloading when files change. This mode allows each process to host multiple concurrent agents efficiently.

The agent connects to LiveKit Cloud or your self-hosted server. Set the following environment variables:
- LIVEKIT_URL
- LIVEKIT_API_KEY
- LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

You can connect using any LiveKit client SDK or telephony integration.
To get started quickly, try the [Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/).

### Running for production

```shell
python myagent.py start
```

Runs the agent with production-ready optimizations.

*   [Google Research blog](https://research.google/blog/a-decoder-only-foundation-model-for-time-series-forecasting/).
*   [TimesFM in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/timesfm-model):
    an official Google product.

This open version is not an officially supported Google product.

**Latest Model Version:** TimesFM 2.5

**Archived Model Versions:**

-   1.0 and 2.0: relevant code archived in the sub directory `v1`. You can `pip
    install timesfm==1.3.0` to install an older version of this package to load
    them.

## Update - Oct. 29, 2025

Added back the covariate support through XReg for TimesFM 2.5.


## Update - Sept. 15, 2025

TimesFM 2.5 is out!

Comparing to TimesFM 2.0, this new 2.5 model:

-   uses 200M parameters, down from 500M.
-   supports up to 16k context length, up from 2048.
-   supports continuous quantile forecast up to 1k horizon via an optional 30M
    quantile head.
-   gets rid of the `frequency` indicator.
-   has a couple of new forecasting flags.

Along with the model upgrade we have also upgraded the inference API. This repo
will be under construction over the next few weeks to

1.  add support for an upcoming Flax version of the model (faster inference).
2.  add back covariate support.
3.  populate more docstrings, docs and notebook.

### Install

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/google-research/timesfm.git
    cd timesfm
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`:
    ```shell
    # Create a virtual environment
    uv venv
    
    # Activate the environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install the package in editable mode with torch
    uv pip install -e .[torch]
    # Or with flax
    uv pip install -e .[flax]
    # Or XReg is needed
    uv pip install -e .[xreg]
    ```

3. [Optional] Install your preferred `torch` / `jax` backend based on your OS and accelerators
(CPU, GPU, TPU or Apple Silicon).:

-   [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
-   [Install Jax](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#installation)
    for Flax.
