## Overview

VoxCPM is a novel tokenizer-free Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that redefines realism in speech synthesis. By modeling speech in a continuous space, it overcomes the limitations of discrete tokenization and enables two flagship capabilities: context-aware speech generation and true-to-life zero-shot voice cloning.

Unlike mainstream approaches that convert speech to discrete tokens, VoxCPM uses an end-to-end diffusion autoregressive architecture that directly generates continuous speech representations from text. Built on [MiniCPM-4](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4-0.5B) backbone, it achieves implicit semantic-acoustic decoupling through hierachical language modeling and FSQ constraints, greatly enhancing both expressiveness and generation stability.

  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/voxcpm_model.png&quot; alt=&quot;VoxCPM Model Architecture&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


###  🚀 Key Features
- **Context-Aware, Expressive Speech Generation** - VoxCPM comprehends text to infer and generate appropriate prosody, delivering speech with remarkable expressiveness and natural flow. It spontaneously adapts speaking style based on content, producing highly fitting vocal expression trained on a massive 1.8 million-hour bilingual corpus.
- **True-to-Life Voice Cloning** - With only a short reference audio clip, VoxCPM performs accurate zero-shot voice cloning, capturing not only the speaker&#039;s timbre but also fine-grained characteristics such as accent, emotional tone, rhythm, and pacing to create a faithful and natural replica.
- **High-Efficiency Synthesis** - VoxCPM supports streaming synthesis with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) as low as 0.17 on a consumer-grade NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, making it possible for real-time applications.

## Introduction

LangExtract is a Python library that uses LLMs to extract structured information from unstructured text documents based on user-defined instructions. It processes materials such as clinical notes or reports, identifying and organizing key details while ensuring the extracted data corresponds to the source text.

## Why LangExtract?

1.  **Precise Source Grounding:** Maps every extraction to its exact location in the source text, enabling visual highlighting for easy traceability and verification.
2.  **Reliable Structured Outputs:** Enforces a consistent output schema based on your few-shot examples, leveraging controlled generation in supported models like Gemini to guarantee robust, structured results.
3.  **Optimized for Long Documents:** Overcomes the &quot;needle-in-a-haystack&quot; challenge of large document extraction by using an optimized strategy of text chunking, parallel processing, and multiple passes for higher recall.
4.  **Interactive Visualization:** Instantly generates a self-contained, interactive HTML file to visualize and review thousands of extracted entities in their original context.
5.  **Flexible LLM Support:** Supports your preferred models, from cloud-based LLMs like the Google Gemini family to local open-source models via the built-in Ollama interface.
6.  **Adaptable to Any Domain:** Define extraction tasks for any domain using just a few examples. LangExtract adapts to your needs without requiring any model fine-tuning.
7.  **Leverages LLM World Knowledge:** Utilize precise prompt wording and few-shot examples to influence how the extraction task may utilize LLM knowledge. The accuracy of any inferred information and its adherence to the task specification are contingent upon the selected LLM, the complexity of the task, the clarity of the prompt instructions, and the nature of the prompt examples.

## Quick Start

&gt; **Note:** Using cloud-hosted models like Gemini requires an API key. See the [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup-for-cloud-models) section for instructions on how to get and configure your key.

Extract structured information with just a few lines of code.

### 1. Define Your Extraction Task

First, create a prompt that clearly describes what you want to extract. Then, provide a high-quality example to guide the model.

```python
import langextract as lx
import textwrap

# 1. Define the prompt and extraction rules
prompt = textwrap.dedent(&quot;&quot;&quot;\
    Extract characters, emotions, and relationships in order of appearance.
    Use exact text for extractions. Do not paraphrase or overlap entities.
    Provide meaningful attributes for each entity to add context.&quot;&quot;&quot;)

# 2. Provide a high-quality example to guide the model
examples = [
    lx.data.ExampleData(
        text=&quot;ROMEO. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.&quot;,
        extractions=[
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class=&quot;character&quot;,
                extraction_text=&quot;ROMEO&quot;,
                attributes={&quot;emotional_state&quot;: &quot;wonder&quot;}
            ),
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class=&quot;emotion&quot;,
                extraction_text=&quot;But soft!&quot;,
                attributes={&quot;feeling&quot;: &quot;gentle awe&quot;}
            ),
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class=&quot;relationship&quot;,
                extraction_text=&quot;Juliet is the sun&quot;,
                attributes={&quot;type&quot;: &quot;metaphor&quot;}
            ),
        ]
    )
]
```

&gt; **Note:** Examples drive model behavior. Each `extraction_text` should ideally be verbatim from the example&#039;s `text` (no paraphrasing), listed in order of appearance. LangExtract raises `Prompt alignment` warnings by default if examples don&#039;t follow this pattern—resolve these for best results.

### 2. Run the Extraction

Provide your input text and the prompt materials to the `lx.extract` function.

```python
# The input text to be processed
input_text = &quot;Lady Juliet gazed longingly at the stars, her heart aching for Romeo&quot;

# Run the extraction
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
)
```

&gt; **Model Selection**: `gemini-2.5-flash` is the recommended default, offering an excellent balance of speed, cost, and quality. For highly complex tasks requiring deeper reasoning, `gemini-2.5-pro` may provide superior results. For large-scale or production use, a Tier 2 Gemini quota is suggested to increase throughput and avoid rate limits. See the [rate-limit documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-2) for details.
&gt;
&gt; **Model Lifecycle**: Note that Gemini models have a lifecycle with defined retirement dates. Users should consult the [official model version documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions) to stay informed about the latest stable and legacy versions.

### 3. Visualize the Results

The extractions can be saved to a `.jsonl` file, a popular format for working with language model data. LangExtract can then generate an interactive HTML visualization from this file to review the entities in context.

```python
# Save the results to a JSONL file
lx.io.save_annotated_documents([result], output_name=&quot;extraction_results.jsonl&quot;, output_dir=&quot;.&quot;)

# Generate the visualization from the file
html_content = lx.visualize(&quot;extraction_results.jsonl&quot;)
with open(&quot;visualization.html&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as f:
    if hasattr(html_content, &#039;data&#039;):
        f.write(html_content.data)  # For Jupyter/Colab
    else:
        f.write(html_content)
```

This creates an animated and interactive HTML file:

&gt; **Note on LLM Knowledge Utilization:** This example demonstrates extractions that stay close to the text evidence - extracting &quot;longing&quot; for Lady Juliet&#039;s emotional state and identifying &quot;yearning&quot; from &quot;gazed longingly at the stars.&quot; The task could be modified to generate attributes that draw more heavily from the LLM&#039;s world knowledge (e.g., adding `&quot;identity&quot;: &quot;Capulet family daughter&quot;` or `&quot;literary_context&quot;: &quot;tragic heroine&quot;`). The balance between text-evidence and knowledge-inference is controlled by your prompt instructions and example attributes.

### Scaling to Longer Documents

For larger texts, you can process entire documents directly from URLs with parallel processing and enhanced sensitivity:

```python
# Process Romeo &amp; Juliet directly from Project Gutenberg
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1513/1513-0.txt&quot;,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    extraction_passes=3,    # Improves recall through multiple passes
    max_workers=20,         # Parallel processing for speed
    max_char_buffer=1000    # Smaller contexts for better accuracy
)
```

This approach can extract hundreds of entities from full novels while maintaining high accuracy. The interactive visualization seamlessly handles large result sets, making it easy to explore hundreds of entities from the output JSONL file. **[See the full *Romeo and Juliet* extraction example →](https://github.com/google/langextract/blob/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md)** for detailed results and performance insights.

### Vertex AI Batch Processing

Save costs on large-scale tasks by enabling Vertex AI Batch API: `language_model_params={&quot;vertexai&quot;: True, &quot;batch&quot;: {&quot;enabled&quot;: True}}`.

See an example of the Vertex AI Batch API usage in [this example](docs/examples/batch_api_example.md).

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install langextract
```

*Recommended for most users. For isolated environments, consider using a virtual environment:*

```bash
python -m venv langextract_env
source langextract_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: langextract_env\Scripts\activate
pip install langextract
```

### From Source

LangExtract uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml` for dependency management:

*Installing with `-e` puts the package in development mode, allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.*


```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/langextract.git
cd langextract

# For basic installation:
pip install -e .

# For development (includes linting tools):
pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;

# For testing (includes pytest):
pip install -e &quot;.[test]&quot;
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t langextract .
docker run --rm -e LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot; langextract python your_script.py
```

## API Key Setup for Cloud Models

When using LangExtract with cloud-hosted models (like Gemini or OpenAI), you&#039;ll need to
set up an API key. On-device models don&#039;t require an API key. For developers
using local LLMs, LangExtract offers built-in support for Ollama and can be
extended to other third-party APIs by updating the inference endpoints.

### API Key Sources

Get API keys from:

*   [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for Gemini models
*   [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdks/overview) for enterprise use
*   [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for OpenAI models

### Setting up API key in your environment

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```bash
export LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

**Option 2: .env File (Recommended)**

Add your API key to a `.env` file:

```bash
# Add API key to .env file
cat &gt;&gt; .env &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
EOF

# Keep your API key secure
echo &#039;.env&#039; &gt;&gt; .gitignore
```

In your Python code:
```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=&quot;Extract information...&quot;,
    examples=[...],
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;
)
```

**Option 3: Direct API Key (Not Recommended for Production)**

You can also provide the API key directly in your code, though this is not recommended for production use:

```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=&quot;Extract information...&quot;,
    examples=[...],
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    api_key=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;  # Only use this for testing/development
)
```

**Option 4: Vertex AI (Service Accounts)**

Use [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) for authentication with service accounts:

```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=&quot;Extract information...&quot;,
    examples=[...],
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    language_model_params={
        &quot;vertexai&quot;: True,
        &quot;project&quot;: &quot;your-project-id&quot;,
        &quot;location&quot;: &quot;global&quot;  # or regional endpoint
    }
)
```

## Adding Custom Model Providers

LangExtract supports custom LLM providers via a lightweight plugin system. You can add support for new models without changing core code.

- Add new model support independently of the core library
- Distribute your provider as a separate Python package
- Keep custom dependencies isolated
- Override or extend built-in providers via priority-based resolution

See the detailed guide in [Provider System Documentation](langextract/providers/README.md) to learn how to:

- Register a provider with `@registry.register(...)`
- Publish an entry point for discovery
- Optionally provide a schema with `get_schema_class()` for structured output
- Integrate with the factory via `create_model(...)`

## Using OpenAI Models

LangExtract supports OpenAI models (requires optional dependency: `pip install langextract[openai]`):

```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,  # Automatically selects OpenAI provider
    api_key=os.environ.get(&#039;OPENAI_API_KEY&#039;),
    fence_output=True,
    use_schema_constraints=False
)
```

Note: OpenAI models require `fence_output=True` and `use_schema_constraints=False` because LangExtract doesn&#039;t implement schema constraints for OpenAI yet.

## Using Local LLMs with Ollama
LangExtract supports local inference using Ollama, allowing you to run models without API keys:

```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gemma2:2b&quot;,  # Automatically selects Ollama provider
    model_url=&quot;http://localhost:11434&quot;,
    fence_output=False,
    use_schema_constraints=False
)
```

**Quick setup:** Install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/), run `ollama pull gemma2:2b`, then `ollama serve`.

For detailed installation, Docker setup, and examples, see [`examples/ollama/`](examples/ollama/).

## More Examples

Additional examples of LangExtract in action:

### *Romeo and Juliet* Full Text Extraction

LangExtract can process complete documents directly from URLs. This example demonstrates extraction from the full text of *Romeo and Juliet* from Project Gutenberg (147,843 characters), showing parallel processing, sequential extraction passes, and performance optimization for long document processing.

**[View *Romeo and Juliet* Full Text Example →](https://github.com/google/langextract/blob/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md)**

### Medication Extraction

&gt; **Disclaimer:** This demonstration is for illustrative purposes of LangExtract&#039;s baseline capability only. It does not represent a finished or approved product, is not intended to diagnose or suggest treatment of any disease or condition, and should not be used for medical advice.

LangExtract excels at extracting structured medical information from clinical text. These examples demonstrate both basic entity recognition (medication names, dosages, routes) and relationship extraction (connecting medications to their attributes), showing LangExtract&#039;s effectiveness for healthcare applications.

## Release notes (1.4.0)
- Added Hunyuan3D support


### Previously added features:
- View screenshots for Blender viewport to better understand the scene
- Search and download Sketchfab models
- Support for Poly Haven assets through their API
- Support to generate 3D models using Hyper3D Rodin
- Run Blender MCP on a remote host
- Telemetry for tools executed (completely anonymous)

### Installating a new version (existing users)
- For newcomers, you can go straight to Installation. For existing users, see the points below
- Download the latest addon.py file and replace the older one, then add it to Blender
- Delete the MCP server from Claude and add it back again, and you should be good to go!


## Features

- **Two-way communication**: Connect Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server
- **Object manipulation**: Create, modify, and delete 3D objects in Blender
- **Material control**: Apply and modify materials and colors
- **Scene inspection**: Get detailed information about the current Blender scene
- **Code execution**: Run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude

## Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Blender Addon (`addon.py`)**: A Blender addon that creates a socket server within Blender to receive and execute commands
2. **MCP Server (`src/blender_mcp/server.py`)**: A Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blender addon

## Installation


### Prerequisites

- Blender 3.0 or newer
- Python 3.10 or newer
- uv package manager: 

**If you&#039;re on Mac, please install uv as**
```bash
brew install uv
```
**On Windows**
```powershell
powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot; 
```
and then add uv to the user path in Windows (you may need to restart Claude Desktop after):
```powershell
$localBin = &quot;$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin&quot;
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;Path&quot;, &quot;User&quot;)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;Path&quot;, &quot;$userPath;$localBin&quot;, &quot;User&quot;)
```

Otherwise installation instructions are on their website: [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

**⚠️ Do not proceed before installing UV**

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Blender connection:

- `BLENDER_HOST`: Host address for Blender socket server (default: &quot;localhost&quot;)
- `BLENDER_PORT`: Port number for Blender socket server (default: 9876)

Example:
```bash
export BLENDER_HOST=&#039;host.docker.internal&#039;
export BLENDER_PORT=9876
```

### Claude for Desktop Integration

[Watch the setup instruction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neoK_WMq92g) (Assuming you have already installed uv)

Go to Claude &gt; Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config &gt; claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```json
{
    &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
        &quot;blender&quot;: {
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;uvx&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [
                &quot;blender-mcp&quot;
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Claude Code&lt;/summary&gt;

Use the Claude Code CLI to add the blender MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add blender uvx blender-mcp
```
&lt;/details&gt;

### Cursor integration

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=blender&amp;config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IGJsZW5kZXItbWNwIn0%3D)

For Mac users, go to Settings &gt; MCP and paste the following 

- To use as a global server, use &quot;add new global MCP server&quot; button and paste
- To use as a project specific server, create `.cursor/mcp.json` in the root of the project and paste


```json
{
    &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
        &quot;blender&quot;: {
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;uvx&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [
                &quot;blender-mcp&quot;
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

For Windows users, go to Settings &gt; MCP &gt; Add Server, add a new server with the following settings:

```json
{
    &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
        &quot;blender&quot;: {
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;cmd&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [
                &quot;/c&quot;,
                &quot;uvx&quot;,
                &quot;blender-mcp&quot;
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

[Cursor setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgWsJshecac)

**⚠️ Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both**

### Visual Studio Code Integration

_Prerequisites_: Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed before proceeding.

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_blender--mcp_server-0098FF?style=flat-square&amp;logo=visualstudiocode&amp;logoColor=ffffff)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22blender-mcp%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22blender-mcp%22%5D%7D)

### Installing the Blender Addon

1. Download the `addon.py` file from this repo
1. Open Blender
2. Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Add-ons
3. Click &quot;Install...&quot; and select the `addon.py` file
4. Enable the addon by checking the box next to &quot;Interface: Blender MCP&quot;


## Usage

### Starting the Connection
![BlenderMCP in the sidebar](assets/addon-instructions.png)

1. In Blender, go to the 3D View sidebar (press N if not visible)
2. Find the &quot;BlenderMCP&quot; tab
3. Turn on the Poly Haven checkbox if you want assets from their API (optional)
4. Click &quot;Connect to Claude&quot;
5. Make sure the MCP server is running in your terminal

### Using with Claude

Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the addon is running on Blender, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Blender MCP.

![BlenderMCP in the sidebar](assets/hammer-icon.png)

#### Capabilities

- Get scene and object information 
- Create, delete and modify shapes
- Apply or create materials for objects
- Execute any Python code in Blender
- Download the right models, assets and HDRIs through [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/)
- AI generated 3D models through [Hyper3D Rodin](https://hyper3d.ai/)


### Example Commands

Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do:

- &quot;Create a low poly scene in a dungeon, with a dragon guarding a pot of gold&quot; [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqgKuLYUv00)
- &quot;Create a beach vibe using HDRIs, textures, and models like rocks and vegetation from Poly Haven&quot; [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I29rn92gkC4)
- Give a reference image, and create a Blender scene out of it [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDRb03XPiRo)
- &quot;Generate a 3D model of a garden gnome through Hyper3D&quot;
- &quot;Get information about the current scene, and make a threejs sketch from it&quot; [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxbNI5L7AH8)
- &quot;Make this car red and metallic&quot; 
- &quot;Create a sphere and place it above the cube&quot;
- &quot;Make the lighting like a studio&quot;
- &quot;Point the camera at the scene, and make it isometric&quot;

## Hyper3D integration

Hyper3D&#039;s free trial key allows you to generate a limited number of models per day. If the daily limit is reached, you can wait for the next day&#039;s reset or obtain your own key from hyper3d.ai and fal.ai.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Make sure the Blender addon server is running, and the MCP server is configured on Claude, DO NOT run the uvx command in the terminal. Sometimes, the first command won&#039;t go through but after that it starts working.
- **Timeout errors**: Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps
- **Poly Haven integration**: Claude is sometimes erratic with its behaviour
- **Have you tried turning it off and on again?**: If you&#039;re still having connection errors, try restarting both Claude and the Blender server


## Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

The system uses a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets:

- **Commands** are sent as JSON objects with a `type` and optional `params`
- **Responses** are JSON objects with a `status` and `result` or `message`

## Limitations &amp; Security Considerations

- The `execute_blender_code` tool allows running arbitrary Python code in Blender, which can be powerful but potentially dangerous. Use with caution in production environments. ALWAYS save your work before using it.
- Poly Haven requires downloading models, textures, and HDRI images. If you do not want to use it, please turn it off in the checkbox in Blender. 
- Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps

    The smallest vector index in the world. RAG Everything with LEANN!
&lt;/h2&gt;

LEANN is an innovative vector database that democratizes personal AI. Transform your laptop into a powerful RAG system that can index and search through millions of documents while using **97% less storage** than traditional solutions **without accuracy loss**.


LEANN achieves this through *graph-based selective recomputation* with *high-degree preserving pruning*, computing embeddings on-demand instead of storing them all. [Illustration Fig →](#️-architecture--how-it-works) | [Paper →](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08276)

**Ready to RAG Everything?** Transform your laptop into a personal AI assistant that can semantic search your **[file system](#-personal-data-manager-process-any-documents-pdf-txt-md)**, **[emails](#-your-personal-email-secretary-rag-on-apple-mail)**, **[browser history](#-time-machine-for-the-web-rag-your-entire-browser-history)**, **[chat history](#-wechat-detective-unlock-your-golden-memories)** ([WeChat](#-wechat-detective-unlock-your-golden-memories), [iMessage](#-imessage-history-your-personal-conversation-archive)), **[agent memory](#-chatgpt-chat-history-your-personal-ai-conversation-archive)** ([ChatGPT](#-chatgpt-chat-history-your-personal-ai-conversation-archive), [Claude](#-claude-chat-history-your-personal-ai-conversation-archive)), **[live data](#mcp-integration-rag-on-live-data-from-any-platform)** ([Slack](#slack-messages-search-your-team-conversations), [Twitter](#-twitter-bookmarks-your-personal-tweet-library)), **[codebase](#-claude-code-integration-transform-your-development-workflow)**\* , or external knowledge bases (i.e., 60M documents) - all on your laptop, with zero cloud costs and complete privacy.


\* Claude Code only supports basic `grep`-style keyword search. **LEANN** is a drop-in **semantic search MCP service fully compatible with Claude Code**, unlocking intelligent retrieval without changing your workflow. 🔥 Check out [the easy setup →](packages/leann-mcp/README.md)



## Why LEANN?

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/effects.png&quot; alt=&quot;LEANN vs Traditional Vector DB Storage Comparison&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; **The numbers speak for themselves:** Index 60 million text chunks in just 6GB instead of 201GB. From emails to browser history, everything fits on your laptop. [See detailed benchmarks for different applications below ↓](#-storage-comparison)


🔒 **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your laptop. No OpenAI, no cloud, no &quot;terms of service&quot;.

🪶 **Lightweight:** Graph-based recomputation eliminates heavy embedding storage, while smart graph pruning and CSR format minimize graph storage overhead. Always less storage, less memory usage!

📦 **Portable:** Transfer your entire knowledge base between devices (even with others) with minimal cost - your personal AI memory travels with you.

📈 **Scalability:** Handle messy personal data that would crash traditional vector DBs, easily managing your growing personalized data and agent generated memory!

✨ **No Accuracy Loss:** Maintain the same search quality as heavyweight solutions while using 97% less storage.

## Installation

### 📦 Prerequisites: Install uv

[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods) first if you don&#039;t have it. Typically, you can install it with:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 🚀 Quick Install

Clone the repository to access all examples and try amazing applications,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN.git leann
cd leann
```

and install LEANN from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/leann/) to run them immediately:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install leann
```

&lt;!--
&gt; Low-resource? See &quot;Low-resource setups&quot; in the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration-guide.md#low-resource-setups). --&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;🔧 Build from Source (Recommended for development)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;



```bash
git clone https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN.git leann
cd leann
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**macOS:**

Note: DiskANN requires MacOS 13.3 or later.

```bash
brew install libomp boost protobuf zeromq pkgconf
uv sync --extra diskann
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

Note: On Ubuntu 20.04, you may need to build a newer Abseil and pin Protobuf (e.g., v3.20.x) for building DiskANN. See [Issue #30](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN/issues/30) for a step-by-step note.

You can manually install [Intel oneAPI MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) instead of `libmkl-full-dev` for DiskANN. You can also use `libopenblas-dev` for building HNSW only, by removing `--extra diskann` in the command below.

```bash
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y \
  libomp-dev libboost-all-dev protobuf-compiler libzmq3-dev \
  pkg-config libabsl-dev libaio-dev libprotobuf-dev \
  libmkl-full-dev

uv sync --extra diskann
```

**Linux (Arch Linux):**

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu &amp;&amp; sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake pkgconf git gcc \
  boost boost-libs protobuf abseil-cpp libaio zeromq

# For MKL in DiskANN
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
cd paru-bin &amp;&amp; makepkg -si
paru -S intel-oneapi-mkl intel-oneapi-compiler
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

uv sync --extra diskann
```

**Linux (RHEL / CentOS Stream / Oracle / Rocky / AlmaLinux):**

See [Issue #50](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN/issues/50) for more details.

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall -y &quot;Development Tools&quot;
sudo dnf install -y libomp-devel boost-devel protobuf-compiler protobuf-devel \
  abseil-cpp-devel libaio-devel zeromq-devel pkgconf-pkg-config

# For MKL in DiskANN
sudo dnf install -y intel-oneapi-mkl intel-oneapi-mkl-devel \
  intel-oneapi-openmp || sudo dnf install -y intel-oneapi-compiler
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

uv sync --extra diskann
```

&lt;/details&gt;


## Quick Start

Our declarative API makes RAG as easy as writing a config file.

Check out [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) or [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yichuan-w/LEANN/blob/main/demo.ipynb)

```python
from leann import LeannBuilder, LeannSearcher, LeannChat
from pathlib import Path
INDEX_PATH = str(Path(&quot;./&quot;).resolve() / &quot;demo.leann&quot;)

# Build an index
builder = LeannBuilder(backend_name=&quot;hnsw&quot;)
builder.add_text(&quot;LEANN saves 97% storage compared to traditional vector databases.&quot;)
builder.add_text(&quot;Tung Tung Tung Sahur called—they need their banana‑crocodile hybrid back&quot;)
builder.build_index(INDEX_PATH)

# Search
searcher = LeannSearcher(INDEX_PATH)
results = searcher.search(&quot;fantastical AI-generated creatures&quot;, top_k=1)

# Chat with your data
chat = LeannChat(INDEX_PATH, llm_config={&quot;type&quot;: &quot;hf&quot;, &quot;model&quot;: &quot;Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B&quot;})
response = chat.ask(&quot;How much storage does LEANN save?&quot;, top_k=1)
```

## RAG on Everything!

LEANN supports RAG on various data sources including documents (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`), Apple Mail, Google Search History, WeChat, ChatGPT conversations, Claude conversations, iMessage conversations, and **live data from any platform through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** - including Slack, Twitter, and more.



### Generation Model Setup

#### LLM Backend

LEANN supports many LLM providers for text generation (HuggingFace, Ollama, Anthropic, and Any OpenAI compatible API).


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔑 OpenAI API Setup (Default)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

Make sure to use `--llm openai` flag when using the CLI.
You can also specify the model name with `--llm-model &lt;model-name&gt;` flag.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🛠️ Supported LLM &amp; Embedding Providers (via OpenAI Compatibility)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Thanks to the widespread adoption of the OpenAI API format, LEANN is compatible out-of-the-box with a vast array of LLM and embedding providers. Simply set the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables to connect to your preferred service.

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;xxx&quot;
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=&quot;http://localhost:1234/v1&quot; # base url of the provider
```

To use OpenAI compatible endpoint with the CLI interface:

If you are using it for text generation, make sure to use `--llm openai` flag and specify the model name with `--llm-model &lt;model-name&gt;` flag.

If you are using it for embedding, set the `--embedding-mode openai` flag and specify the model name with `--embedding-model &lt;MODEL&gt;`.

Below is a list of base URLs for common providers to get you started.


### 🖥️ Local Inference Engines (Recommended for full privacy)

| Provider         | Sample Base URL             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Ollama** | `http://localhost:11434/v1` |
| **LM Studio** | `http://localhost:1234/v1`  |
| **vLLM** | `http://localhost:8000/v1`  |
| **llama.cpp** | `http://localhost:8080/v1`  |
| **SGLang** | `http://localhost:30000/v1` |
| **LiteLLM** | `http://localhost:4000`     |

-----

### ☁️ Cloud Providers

&gt; **🚨 A Note on Privacy:** Before choosing a cloud provider, carefully review their privacy and data retention policies. Depending on their terms, your data may be used for their own purposes, including but not limited to human reviews and model training, which can lead to serious consequences if not handled properly.


| Provider         | Base URL                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI** | `https://api.openai.com/v1`                                |
| **OpenRouter** | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`                             |
| **Gemini** | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` |
| **x.AI (Grok)** | `https://api.x.ai/v1`                                      |
| **Groq AI** | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`                           |
| **DeepSeek** | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`                              |
| **SiliconFlow** | `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1`                            |
| **Zhipu (BigModel)** | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/`                |
| **Mistral AI** | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1`                                |
| **Anthropic** | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`                             |
| **Jina AI** (Embeddings) | `https://api.jina.ai/v1`                         |

&gt; **💡 Tip: Separate Embedding Provider**
&gt;
&gt; To use a different provider for embeddings (e.g., Jina AI) while using another for LLM, use `--embedding-api-base` and `--embedding-api-key`:
&gt; ```bash
&gt; leann build my-index --docs ./docs \
&gt;   --embedding-mode openai \
&gt;   --embedding-model jina-embeddings-v3 \
&gt;   --embedding-api-base https://api.jina.ai/v1 \
&gt;   --embedding-api-key $JINA_API_KEY
&gt; ```

If your provider isn&#039;t on this list, don&#039;t worry! Check their documentation for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint—chances are, it&#039;s OpenAI Compatible too!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🔧 Ollama Setup (Recommended for full privacy)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

**macOS:**

First, [download Ollama for macOS](https://ollama.com/download/mac).

```bash
# Pull a lightweight model (recommended for consumer hardware)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

**Linux:**

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama service manually
ollama serve &amp;

# Pull a lightweight model (recommended for consumer hardware)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## About

  The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username
  and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally
  stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is
  a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password
  through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of
  alternate values.

  A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumberic characters,
  making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily
  guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address,
  name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.

  That is why CUPP was born, and it can be used in situations like legal
  penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.


Requirements
------------

You need Python 3 to run CUPP.

Quick start
-----------

## UPDATE
You can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)

If you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program

For other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer to their documentation

&lt;a id=&quot;update-channels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.

* `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.
* The `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project&#039;s new patches and changes. This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip&#039;s `--pre` flag).
* The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).

When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.

You may also use `--update-to &lt;repository&gt;` (`&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.

Example usage:

* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release
* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`
* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel
* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`

**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:
```
# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly

# To install nightly with pip:
python -m pip install -U --pre &quot;yt-dlp[default]&quot;
```

When running a yt-dlp version that is older than 90 days, you will see a warning message suggesting to update to the latest version.
You can suppress this warning by adding `--no-update` to your command or configuration file.

## DEPENDENCIES
Python versions 3.10+ (CPython) and 3.11+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.

&lt;!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created
&lt;!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x&gt;
On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt;

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `yt-dlp-ejs` and a supported JavaScript runtime/engine are highly recommended

### Strongly recommended

* [**ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**](https://www.ffmpeg.org) - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds

    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)

* [**yt-dlp-ejs**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs) - Required for deciphering YouTube n/sig values. Licensed under [Unlicense](https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs/blob/main/LICENSE), bundles [MIT](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring/blob/main/LICENSE) and [ISC](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah/blob/main/LICENSE.md) components.

    A JavaScript runtime/engine like [**deno**](https://deno.land) (recommended), [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org), [**bun**](https://bun.sh), or [**QuickJS**](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) is also required to run yt-dlp-ejs. See [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS).

## How does Pocket Flow work?

The [100 lines](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/blob/main/pocketflow/__init__.py) capture the core abstraction of LLM frameworks: Graph!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

From there, it&#039;s easy to implement popular design patterns like ([Multi-](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/multi_agent.html))[Agents](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/agent.html), [Workflow](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/workflow.html), [RAG](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/rag.html), etc.

# Paperless-ngx

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, _less paper_.

Paperless-ngx is the official successor to the original [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) &amp; [Paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) projects and is designed to distribute the responsibility of advancing and supporting the project among a team of people. [Consider joining us!](#community-support)

Thanks to the generous folks at [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/8d70b916d462), a demo is available at [demo.paperless-ngx.com](https://demo.paperless-ngx.com) using login `demo` / `demo`. _Note: demo content is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded._

A full list of [features](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/#features) and [screenshots](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/#screenshots) are available in the [documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/).

# Getting started

The easiest way to deploy paperless is `docker compose`. The files in the [`/docker/compose` directory](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/tree/main/docker/compose) are configured to pull the image from the GitHub container registry.

If you&#039;d like to jump right in, you can configure a `docker compose` environment with our install script:

```bash
bash -c &quot;$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)&quot;
```

More details and step-by-step guides for alternative installation methods can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#installation).

Migrating from Paperless-ng is easy, just drop in the new docker image! See the [documentation on migrating](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#migrating-to-paperless-ngx) for more details.

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/wiki/Related-Projects) for a user-maintained list of related projects and software that is compatible with Paperless-ngx.

# Important Note

&gt; Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. **Paperless-ngx should never be run on an untrusted host** because information is stored in clear text without encryption. No guarantees are made regarding security (but we do try!) and you use the app at your own risk.
&gt; **The safest way to run Paperless-ngx is on a local server in your own home with backups in place**.

```
/connect-apps:setup
```

Paste your API key when asked. (Get a free key at [platform.composio.dev](https://platform.composio.dev/?utm_source=Github&amp;utm_content=AwesomeSkills))

### 3. Restart &amp; Try It

```bash
exit
claude
```

&gt; **Want skills that do more than generate text?** Claude can send emails, create issues, post to Slack, and take actions across 1000+ apps. [See how →](./connect/)

If you receive the email, Claude is now connected to 500+ apps.

### What is the idea: 

Transformer-based ASR architectures like Whisper suffer significant performance degradation when applied to the **spontaneous and noisy domain of JAV**. This degradation is driven by specific acoustic and temporal characteristics that defy the statistical distributions of standard training data.

#### 1. The Acoustic Profile
JAV audio is defined by &quot;acoustic hell&quot; and a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), characterized by:

*   **Non-Verbal Vocalisations (NVVs):** A high density of physiological sounds (heavy breathing, gasps, sighs) and &quot;obscene sounds&quot; that lack clear harmonic structure.
*   **Spectral Mimicry:** These vocalizations often possess &quot;curve-like spectrum features&quot; that mimic the formants of fricative consonants or Japanese syllables (e.g., *fu*), acting as accidental adversarial examples that trick the model into recognizing words where none exist.
*   **Extreme Dynamics:** Volatile shifts in audio intensity, ranging from faint whispers (*sasayaki*) to high-decibel screams, which confuse standard gain control and attention mechanisms.
*   **Linguistic Variance:** The prevalence of theatrical onomatopoeia and *Role Language* (*Yakuwarigo*) containing exaggerated intonations and slang absent from standard corpora.

#### 2. Temporal Drift and Hallucination
While standard ASR models are typically trained on short, curated clips, JAV content comprises long-form media often exceeding 120 minutes. Research indicates that processing such extended inputs causes **contextual drift** and error accumulation. Specifically, extended periods of &quot;ambiguous audio&quot; (silence or rhythmic breathing) cause the Transformer&#039;s attention mechanism to collapse, triggering repetitive **hallucination loops** where the model generates unrelated text to fill the acoustic void.

#### 3. The Pre-processing Paradox &amp; Fine-Tuning Risks
Standard audio engineering intuition—such as aggressive denoising or vocal separation—often fails in this domain. Because Whisper relies on specific **log-Mel spectrogram** features, generic normalization tools can inadvertently strip high-frequency transients essential for distinguishing consonants, resulting in &quot;domain shift&quot; and erroneous transcriptions. Consequently, audio processing requires a &quot;surgical,&quot; multi-stage approach (like VAD clamping) rather than blanket filtering.

Furthermore, while fine-tuning models on domain-specific data can be effective, it presents a high risk of **overfitting**. Due to the scarcity of high-quality, ethically sourced JAV datasets, fine-tuned models often become brittle, losing their generalization capabilities and leading to inconsistent &quot;hit or miss&quot; quality outputs.




**WhisperJAV** is an attempt to address above failure points. The inference pipelines do:

1.  **Acoustic Filtering:** Deploys **scene-based segmentation** and VAD clamping under the hypothesis that distinct scenes possess uniform acoustic characteristics, ensuring the model processes coherent audio environments rather than mixed streams [1-3].
2.  **Linguistic Adaptation:** Normalizes **domain-specific terminology** and preserves onomatopoeia, specifically correcting dialect-induced tokenization errors (e.g., in *Kansai-ben*) that standard BPE tokenizers fail to parse [4, 5].
3.  **Defensive Decoding:** Tunes **log-probability thresholding** and `no_speech_threshold` to systematically discard low-confidence outputs (hallucinations), while utilizing regex filters to clean non-lexical markers (e.g., `(moans)`) from the final subtitle track [6, 7].

## Quick Start

### GUI (Recommended for most users)

```bash
whisperjav-gui
```

A window opens. Add your files, pick a mode, click Start.

### Command Line

```bash
# Basic usage
whisperjav video.mp4

# Specify mode and sensitivity
whisperjav audio.mp3 --mode balanced --sensitivity aggressive

# Process a folder
whisperjav /path/to/media_folder --output-dir ./subtitles
```

---

## Features

### Processing Modes

| Mode | Backend | Scene Detection | VAD | Best For |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----|----------|
| **faster** | stable-ts (turbo) | No | No | Speed priority, clean audio |
| **fast** | stable-ts | Yes | No | General use, mixed quality |
| **balanced** | faster-whisper | Yes | Yes | Default. Noisy audio, dialogue-heavy |
| **fidelity** | OpenAI Whisper | Yes | Yes (Silero) | Maximum accuracy, slower |
| **transformers** | HuggingFace | Optional | Internal | Japanese-optimized model, customizable |

### Sensitivity Settings

- **Conservative**: Higher thresholds, fewer hallucinations. Good for noisy content.
- **Balanced**: Default. Works for most content.
- **Aggressive**: Lower thresholds, catches more dialogue. Good for whisper/ASMR content.

### Transformers Mode (New in v1.7)

Uses HuggingFace&#039;s `kotoba-tech/kotoba-whisper-v2.2` model, which is optimized for Japanese conversational speech:

```bash
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode transformers

# Customize parameters
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode transformers --hf-beam-size 5 --hf-chunk-length 20
```

**Transformers-specific options:**
- `--hf-model-id`: Model (default: `kotoba-tech/kotoba-whisper-v2.2`)
- `--hf-chunk-length`: Seconds per chunk (default: 15)
- `--hf-beam-size`: Beam search width (default: 5)
- `--hf-temperature`: Sampling temperature (default: 0.0)
- `--hf-scene`: Scene detection method (`none`, `auditok`, `silero`, `semantic`)

### Two-Pass Ensemble Mode (New in v1.7)

Runs your video through two different pipelines and merges results. Different models catch different things.

```bash
# Pass 1 with transformers, Pass 2 with balanced
whisperjav video.mp4 --ensemble --pass1-pipeline transformers --pass2-pipeline balanced

# Custom sensitivity per pass
whisperjav video.mp4 --ensemble --pass1-pipeline balanced --pass1-sensitivity aggressive --pass2-pipeline fidelity
```

**Merge strategies:**
- `smart_merge` (default): Intelligent overlap detection
- `pass1_primary` / `pass2_primary`: Prioritize one pass, fill gaps from other
- `full_merge`: Combine everything from both passes

### Speech Enhancement tools (New in v1.7.3)

Pre-process audio scenes. When selected runs per-scene after scene detection.
Note: Only use for surgical reasons. In general any audio processing that may alter mel-spectogram has the potential to introduce more artefacts and hallucination.

```bash
# ClearVoice denoising (48kHz, best quality)
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode balanced --pass1-speech-enhancer clearvoice

# ClearVoice with specific 16kHz model
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode balanced --pass1-speech-enhancer clearvoice:FRCRN_SE_16K

# FFmpeg DSP filters (lightweight, always available)
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode balanced --pass1-speech-enhancer ffmpeg-dsp:loudnorm,denoise

# ZipEnhancer (lightweight SOTA)
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode balanced --pass1-speech-enhancer zipenhancer

# BS-RoFormer vocal isolation
whisperjav video.mp4 --mode balanced --pass1-speech-enhancer bs-roformer

# Ensemble with different enhancers per pass
whisperjav video.mp4 --ensemble \
    --pass1-pipeline balanced --pass1-speech-enhancer clearvoice \
    --pass2-pipeline transformers --pass2-speech-enhancer none
```

**Available backends:**

| Backend | Description | Models/Options |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `none` | No enhancement (default) | - |
| `ffmpeg-dsp` | FFmpeg audio filters | `loudnorm`, `denoise`, `compress`, `highpass`, `lowpass`, `deess` |
| `clearvoice` | ClearerVoice denoising | `MossFormer2_SE_48K` (default), `FRCRN_SE_16K` |
| `zipenhancer` | ZipEnhancer 16kHz | `torch` (GPU), `onnx` (CPU) |
| `bs-roformer` | Vocal isolation | `vocals`, `other` |

**Syntax:** `--pass1-speech-enhancer &lt;backend&gt;` or `--pass1-speech-enhancer &lt;backend&gt;:&lt;model&gt;`

### GUI Parameter Customization

The GUI has three tabs:

1. **Transcription Mode**: Select pipeline, sensitivity, language
2. **Advanced Options**: Model override, scene detection method, debug settings
3. **Two-Pass Ensemble**: Configure both passes with full parameter customization via JSON editor

The Ensemble tab lets you customize beam size, temperature, VAD thresholds, and other ASR parameters without editing config files.

### AI Translation

Generate subtitles and translate them in one step:

```bash
# Generate and translate
whisperjav video.mp4 --translate

# Or translate existing subtitles
whisperjav-translate -i subtitles.srt --provider deepseek
```

Supports DeepSeek (cheap), Gemini (free tier), Claude, GPT-4, OpenRouter, GLM, Groq, and local LLMs.

#### Local LLM Translation (New in v1.8)

Run translation entirely on your GPU - no cloud API, no API key required:

```bash
whisperjav-translate -i subtitles.srt --provider local
```

**Zero-Config Setup**: On first use, WhisperJAV automatically downloads and installs `llama-cpp-python` (~700MB). No manual installation needed.

Available models:
| Model | VRAM | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `llama-8b` | 6GB+ | **Default** - Llama 3.1 8B |
| `gemma-9b` | 8GB+ | Gemma 2 9B (alternative) |
| `llama-3b` | 3GB+ | Llama 3.2 3B (low VRAM only) |
| `auto` | varies | Auto-selects based on available VRAM |

```bash
# Use specific model
whisperjav-translate -i subtitles.srt --provider local --model gemma-9b

# Control GPU offloading
whisperjav-translate -i subtitles.srt --provider local --translate-gpu-layers 32
```

**Resume Support**: If translation is interrupted, just run the same command again. It automatically resumes from where it left off using the `.subtrans` project file.

## What Makes It Work for JAV

### Scene Detection
Splits audio at natural breaks instead of forcing fixed-length chunks. This prevents cutting off sentences mid-word.

Three methods are available:
- **Auditok** (default): Energy-based detection, fast and reliable
- **Silero**: Neural VAD-based detection, better for noisy audio
- **Semantic** (new in v1.7.4): Texture-based clustering using MFCC features, groups acoustically similar segments together

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
Identifies when someone is actually speaking vs. background noise or music. Reduces false transcriptions during quiet moments.

### Japanese Post-Processing
- Handles sentence-ending particles (ね, よ, わ, の)
- Preserves aizuchi (うん, はい, ええ)
- Recognizes dialect patterns (Kansai-ben, feminine/masculine speech)
- Filters out common Whisper hallucinations

### Hallucination Removal
Whisper sometimes generates repeated text or phrases that weren&#039;t spoken. WhisperJAV detects and removes these patterns.

---

## Content-Specific Recommendations

| Content Type | Mode | Sensitivity | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------------|-------|
| Drama / Dialogue Heavy | balanced | aggressive | Or try transformers mode |
| Group Scenes | faster | conservative | Speed matters, less precision needed |
| Amateur / Homemade | fast | conservative | Variable audio quality |
| ASMR / VR / Whisper | fidelity | aggressive | Maximum accuracy for quiet speech |
| Heavy Background Music | balanced | conservative | VAD helps filter music |
| Maximum Accuracy | ensemble | varies | Two-pass with different pipelines |

---

3. **Follow the Prompts:** The installer handles all dependencies (Python, FFmpeg, Git) automatically.
4. **Launch:** Open &quot;WhisperJAV&quot; from your Desktop shortcut.

&gt; **Note:** The first launch may take a few minutes as it initializes the engine. GPU is auto-detected; CPU-only mode is used if no compatible GPU is found.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrading from v1.7.x?&lt;/strong&gt; (Click to expand)&lt;/summary&gt;

For major version upgrades (v1.7.x → v1.8.0), a fresh installation is required:

1. **Uninstall v1.7.x first:**
   - Open **Settings** → **Apps** → Search &quot;WhisperJAV&quot; → **Uninstall**
   - Or run: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WhisperJAV\Uninstall-WhisperJAV.exe`

2. **Install v1.8.0:** Run the new installer to the same location.

**What&#039;s preserved:** Your AI models (`%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\`), transcription outputs, and custom files are stored outside the installation directory and will not be deleted.

**Why?** v1.8.0 includes significant dependency changes (NumPy 2.0, new PyTorch, speech enhancement backends) that require a clean environment.

&lt;/details&gt;

### macOS (Apple Silicon &amp; Intel)

*Best for: M1/M2/M3/M4 users and Intel Mac users.*

The install script auto-detects your Mac architecture and handles PyTorch dependencies automatically.

**1. Install Prerequisites**

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools (required for GUI)
xcode-select --install

# Install Homebrew (if not installed)
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;

# Install system tools
brew install python@3.11 ffmpeg git
```

&gt; **GUI Requirement:** The Xcode Command Line Tools are required to compile `pyobjc`, which enables the GUI. Without it, only CLI mode will work.

**2. Install WhisperJAV**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meizhong986/whisperjav.git
cd whisperjav
chmod +x installer/install_linux.sh

# Run the installer (auto-detects Mac architecture)
./installer/install_linux.sh
```

&gt; **Intel Macs:** The script automatically uses CPU-only mode. Expect slower processing (5-10x) compared to Apple Silicon with MPS acceleration.

&gt; **Upgrading from v1.7.x?** Remove your old virtual environment first: `rm -rf whisperjav-env` (or your venv name), then run the installer again.

---

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora)

*Best for: Servers, desktops with NVIDIA GPUs.*

The install script auto-detects NVIDIA GPUs and installs the matching CUDA version.

**1. Install System Dependencies**

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-pip build-essential ffmpeg libsndfile1 git

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install python3-devel gcc ffmpeg libsndfile git
```

**2. Install WhisperJAV**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meizhong986/whisperjav.git
cd whisperjav
chmod +x installer/install_linux.sh

# Standard Install (auto-detects GPU)
./installer/install_linux.sh

# Or force CPU-only (for servers without GPU)
./installer/install_linux.sh --cpu-only
```

&gt; **Performance:** A 2-hour video takes ~5-10 minutes on GPU vs ~30-60 minutes on CPU.

&gt; **Upgrading from v1.7.x?** Remove your old virtual environment first: `rm -rf whisperjav-env` (or your venv name), then run the installer again.

---

### Advanced / Developer

*Best for: Contributors and Python experts.*

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manual pip install&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; **Warning:** Manual `pip install` is risky due to dependency conflicts (NumPy 2.x vs SciPy). We strongly recommend using the scripts above.

**1. Create Environment**

```bash
python -m venv whisperjav-env
source whisperjav-env/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
# whisperjav-env\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

**2. Install PyTorch First (Critical)**

You must install PyTorch *before* the main package to ensure hardware acceleration works.

- **NVIDIA GPU:** `pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`
- **Apple Silicon:** `pip install torch torchaudio`
- **CPU only:** `pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`

**3. Install WhisperJAV**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/meizhong986/whisperjav.git@main
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editable / Dev install&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Use this if you plan to modify the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meizhong986/whisperjav.git
cd whisperjav

# Windows
installer\install_windows.bat --dev

# Mac/Linux
./installer/install_linux.sh --dev

# Or manual
pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Windows source install&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

```batch
git clone https://github.com/meizhong986/whisperjav.git
cd whisperjav
installer\install_windows.bat              # Auto-detects GPU
installer\install_windows.bat --cpu-only   # Force CPU only
installer\install_windows.bat --cuda118    # Force CUDA 11.8
installer\install_windows.bat --cuda124    # Force CUDA 12.4
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10-3.12** (3.9 not supported due to pysubtrans dependency, 3.13+ incompatible with openai-whisper)
- **FFmpeg** in your system PATH
- **GPU recommended**: NVIDIA CUDA, Apple MPS, or AMD ROCm
- **8GB+ disk space** for installation

## Troubleshooting

**FFmpeg not found**: Install FFmpeg and add it to your PATH.

**Slow processing / GPU warning**: Your PyTorch might be CPU-only. Reinstall with GPU support:
```bash
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

**model.bin error in faster mode**: Enable Windows Developer Mode or run as Administrator, then delete the cached model folder:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force &quot;$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\huggingface\hub\models--Systran--faster-whisper-large-v2&quot;
```

---

## Performance

Rough estimates for processing time per hour of video:

| Platform | Time |
|----------|------|
| NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) | 5-10 minutes |
| Apple Silicon (MPS) | 8-15 minutes |
| AMD GPU (ROCm) | 10-20 minutes |
| CPU only | 30-60 minutes |
