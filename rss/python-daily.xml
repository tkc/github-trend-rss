- Content Restrictions: The software includes built-in checks to prevent processing inappropriate media, such as nudity, graphic content, or sensitive material.

- Legal Compliance: We adhere to all relevant laws and ethical guidelines. If legally required, we may shut down the project or add watermarks to the output.

- User Responsibility: We are not responsible for end-user actions. Users must ensure their use of the software aligns with ethical standards and legal requirements.

By using this software, you agree to these terms and commit to using it in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of others.

Users are expected to use this software responsibly and legally. If using a real person&#039;s face, obtain their consent and clearly label any output as a deepfake when sharing online. We are not responsible for end-user actions.

## Exclusive v2.0 Quick Start - Pre-built (Windows)

  &lt;a href=&quot;https://deeplivecam.net/index.php/quickstart&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;media/Download.png&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; height=&quot;77&quot; /&gt;

##### This is the fastest build you can get if you have a discrete NVIDIA or AMD GPU.
 
###### These Pre-builts are perfect for non-technical users or those who don&#039;t have time to, or can&#039;t manually install all the requirements. Just a heads-up: this is an open-source project, so you can also install it manually. This will be 60 days ahead on the open source version.

&lt;/p&gt;

## Installation (Manual)

**Please be aware that the installation requires technical skills and is not for beginners. Consider downloading the prebuilt version.**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to see the process&lt;/summary&gt;

### Installation

This is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.

**1. Set up Your Platform**

-   Python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```
-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git
cd Deep-Live-Cam
```

**3. Download the Models**

1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Place these files in the &quot;**models**&quot; folder.

**4. Install Dependencies**

We highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.

For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For macOS:**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:

```bash
# Install Python 3.10 (specific version is important)
brew install python@3.10

# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)
brew install python-tk@3.10

# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.10
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
rm -rf venv

# Reinstall the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies again
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run:** If you don&#039;t have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).

### GPU Acceleration

**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**

1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 11.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.16.3
```

3. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider cuda
```

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Silicon)**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) specific installation:

1. Make sure you&#039;ve completed the macOS setup above using Python 3.10.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-silicon
pip install onnxruntime-silicon==1.13.1
```

3. Usage (important: specify Python 3.10):

```bash
python3.10 run.py --execution-provider coreml
```

**Important Notes for macOS:**
- You **must** use Python 3.10, not newer versions like 3.11 or 3.13
- Always run with `python3.10` command not just `python` if you have multiple Python versions installed
- If you get error about `_tkinter` missing, reinstall the tkinter package: `brew reinstall python-tk@3.10`
- If you get model loading errors, check that your models are in the correct folder
- If you encounter conflicts with other Python versions, consider uninstalling them:
  ```bash
  # List all installed Python versions
  brew list | grep python
  
  # Uninstall conflicting versions if needed
  brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies python@3.11 python@3.13
  
  # Keep only Python 3.10
  brew cleanup
  ```

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Legacy)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-coreml
pip install onnxruntime-coreml==1.13.1
```

2. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider coreml
```

**DirectML Execution Provider (Windows)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-directml
pip install onnxruntime-directml==1.15.1
```

2. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider directml
```

**OpenVINO™ Execution Provider (Intel)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-openvino
pip install onnxruntime-openvino==1.15.0
```

2. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider openvino
```
&lt;/details&gt;

## Usage

**1. Image/Video Mode**

-   Execute `python run.py`.
-   Choose a source face image and a target image/video.
-   Click &quot;Start&quot;.
-   The output will be saved in a directory named after the target video.

**2. Webcam Mode**

-   Execute `python run.py`.
-   Select a source face image.
-   Click &quot;Live&quot;.
-   Wait for the preview to appear (10-30 seconds).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This repo is for the ACI.dev platform. If you&#039;re looking for the **Unified MCP** server built with ACI.dev, see [aci-mcp](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-mcp).

ACI.dev is the open-source infrastructure layer for AI-agent tool-use. It gives your agents intent-aware access to 600+ tools with multi-tenant auth, granular permissions, and dynamic tool discovery—exposed as either direct function calls or through a **Unified Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server**.

**Example:** Instead of writing separate OAuth flows and API clients for Google Calendar, Slack, and more, use ACI.dev to manage authentication and provide your AI agents with unified, secure function calls. Access these capabilities through our **Unified** [MCP server](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-mcp) or via our lightweight [Python SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-python-sdk), compatible with any LLM framework.

Build production-ready AI agents without the infrastructure headaches.

Qwen-Agent is a framework for developing LLM applications based on the instruction following, tool usage, planning, and
memory capabilities of Qwen.
It also comes with example applications such as Browser Assistant, Code Interpreter, and Custom Assistant.
Now Qwen-Agent plays as the backend of [Qwen Chat](https://chat.qwen.ai/).

# News
* 🔥🔥🔥May 1, 2025: Add [Qwen3 Tool-call Demo](./examples/assistant_qwen3.py).
* Mar 18, 2025: Support for the `reasoning_content` field; adjust the default [Function Call template](./qwen_agent/llm/fncall_prompts/nous_fncall_prompt.py), which is applicable to the Qwen2.5 series general models and QwQ-32B. If you need to use the old version of the template, please refer to the [example](./examples/function_calling.py) for passing parameters.
* Mar 7, 2025: Added [QwQ-32B Tool-call Demo](./examples/assistant_qwq.py). It supports parallel, multi-step, and multi-turn tool calls.
* Dec 3, 2024: Upgrade GUI to Gradio 5 based. Note: GUI requires Python 3.10 or higher.
* Sep 18, 2024: Added [Qwen2.5-Math Demo](./examples/tir_math.py) to showcase the Tool-Integrated Reasoning capabilities of Qwen2.5-Math. Note: The python executor is not sandboxed and is intended for local testing only, not for production use.

# Getting Started

## Installation

- Install the stable version from PyPI:
```bash
pip install -U &quot;qwen-agent[gui,rag,code_interpreter,mcp]&quot;
# Or use `pip install -U qwen-agent` for the minimal requirements.
# The optional requirements, specified in double brackets, are:
#   [gui] for Gradio-based GUI support;
#   [rag] for RAG support;
#   [code_interpreter] for Code Interpreter support;
#   [mcp] for MCP support.
```

- Alternatively, you can install the latest development version from the source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent.git
cd Qwen-Agent
pip install -e ./&quot;[gui,rag,code_interpreter,mcp]&quot;
# Or `pip install -e ./` for minimal requirements.
```

## Preparation: Model Service

You can either use the model service provided by Alibaba
Cloud&#039;s [DashScope](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dashscope/developer-reference/quick-start), or deploy and use your own
model service using the open-source Qwen models.

- If you choose to use the model service offered by DashScope, please ensure that you set the environment
variable `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` to your unique DashScope API key.

- Alternatively, if you prefer to deploy and use your own model service, please follow the instructions provided in the README of Qwen2 for deploying an OpenAI-compatible API service.
Specifically, consult the [vLLM](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2?tab=readme-ov-file#vllm) section for high-throughput GPU deployment or the [Ollama](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2?tab=readme-ov-file#ollama) section for local CPU (+GPU) deployment.
For the QwQ and Qwen3 model, it is recommended to add the `--enable-reasoning` and `--reasoning-parser deepseek_r1` parameters when starting the service. **Do not** add the `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and `--tool-call-parser hermes` parameters, as Qwen-Agent will parse the tool outputs from vLLM on its own.

## Developing Your Own Agent

Qwen-Agent offers atomic components, such as LLMs (which inherit from `class BaseChatModel` and come with [function calling](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/function_calling.py)) and Tools (which inherit
from `class BaseTool`), along with high-level components like Agents (derived from `class Agent`).

The following example illustrates the process of creating an agent capable of reading PDF files and utilizing tools, as
well as incorporating a custom tool:

```py
import pprint
import urllib.parse
import json5
from qwen_agent.agents import Assistant
from qwen_agent.tools.base import BaseTool, register_tool
from qwen_agent.utils.output_beautify import typewriter_print


# Step 1 (Optional): Add a custom tool named `my_image_gen`.
@register_tool(&#039;my_image_gen&#039;)
class MyImageGen(BaseTool):
    # The `description` tells the agent the functionality of this tool.
    description = &#039;AI painting (image generation) service, input text description, and return the image URL drawn based on text information.&#039;
    # The `parameters` tell the agent what input parameters the tool has.
    parameters = [{
        &#039;name&#039;: &#039;prompt&#039;,
        &#039;type&#039;: &#039;string&#039;,
        &#039;description&#039;: &#039;Detailed description of the desired image content, in English&#039;,
        &#039;required&#039;: True
    }]

    def call(self, params: str, **kwargs) -&gt; str:
        # `params` are the arguments generated by the LLM agent.
        prompt = json5.loads(params)[&#039;prompt&#039;]
        prompt = urllib.parse.quote(prompt)
        return json5.dumps(
            {&#039;image_url&#039;: f&#039;https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{prompt}&#039;},
            ensure_ascii=False)


# Step 2: Configure the LLM you are using.
llm_cfg = {
    # Use the model service provided by DashScope:
    &#039;model&#039;: &#039;qwen-max-latest&#039;,
    &#039;model_server&#039;: &#039;dashscope&#039;,
    # &#039;api_key&#039;: &#039;YOUR_DASHSCOPE_API_KEY&#039;,
    # It will use the `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY&#039; environment variable if &#039;api_key&#039; is not set here.

    # Use a model service compatible with the OpenAI API, such as vLLM or Ollama:
    # &#039;model&#039;: &#039;Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct&#039;,
    # &#039;model_server&#039;: &#039;http://localhost:8000/v1&#039;,  # base_url, also known as api_base
    # &#039;api_key&#039;: &#039;EMPTY&#039;,

    # (Optional) LLM hyperparameters for generation:
    &#039;generate_cfg&#039;: {
        &#039;top_p&#039;: 0.8
    }
}

# Step 3: Create an agent. Here we use the `Assistant` agent as an example, which is capable of using tools and reading files.
system_instruction = &#039;&#039;&#039;After receiving the user&#039;s request, you should:
- first draw an image and obtain the image url,
- then run code `request.get(image_url)` to download the image,
- and finally select an image operation from the given document to process the image.
Please show the image using `plt.show()`.&#039;&#039;&#039;
tools = [&#039;my_image_gen&#039;, &#039;code_interpreter&#039;]  # `code_interpreter` is a built-in tool for executing code.
files = [&#039;./examples/resource/doc.pdf&#039;]  # Give the bot a PDF file to read.
bot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg,
                system_message=system_instruction,
                function_list=tools,
                files=files)

# Step 4: Run the agent as a chatbot.
messages = []  # This stores the chat history.
while True:
    # For example, enter the query &quot;draw a dog and rotate it 90 degrees&quot;.
    query = input(&#039;\nuser query: &#039;)
    # Append the user query to the chat history.
    messages.append({&#039;role&#039;: &#039;user&#039;, &#039;content&#039;: query})
    response = []
    response_plain_text = &#039;&#039;
    print(&#039;bot response:&#039;)
    for response in bot.run(messages=messages):
        # Streaming output.
        response_plain_text = typewriter_print(response, response_plain_text)
    # Append the bot responses to the chat history.
    messages.extend(response)
```

In addition to using built-in agent implementations such as `class Assistant`, you can also develop your own agent implemetation by inheriting from `class Agent`.

The framework also provides a convenient GUI interface, supporting the rapid deployment of Gradio Demos for Agents.
For example, in the case above, you can quickly launch a Gradio Demo using the following code:

```py
from qwen_agent.gui import WebUI
WebUI(bot).run()  # bot is the agent defined in the above code, we do not repeat the definition here for saving space.
```
Now you can chat with the Agent in the web UI. Please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples) directory for more usage examples.

# FAQ

## How to Use MCP?

You can select the required tools on the open-source [MCP server website](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) and configure the relevant environment.

Example of MCP invocation format:
```
{
    &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
        &quot;memory&quot;: {
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory&quot;]
        },
        &quot;filesystem&quot;: {
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem&quot;, &quot;/path/to/allowed/files&quot;]
        },
        &quot;sqlite&quot; : {
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;uvx&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [
                &quot;mcp-server-sqlite&quot;,
                &quot;--db-path&quot;,
                &quot;test.db&quot;
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
For more details, you can refer to the [MCP usage example](./examples/assistant_mcp_sqlite_bot.py)

The dependencies required to run this example are as follows:
```
# Node.js (Download and install the latest version from the Node.js official website)
# uv 0.4.18 or higher (Check with uv --version)
# Git (Check with git --version)
# SQLite (Check with sqlite3 --version)

# For macOS users, you can install these components using Homebrew:
brew install uv git sqlite3

# For Windows users, you can install these components using winget:
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
winget install git.git sqlite.sqlite
```
## Do you have function calling (aka tool calling)?

Yes. The LLM classes provide [function calling](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/function_calling.py). Additionally, some Agent classes also are built upon the function calling capability, e.g., FnCallAgent and ReActChat.

## How to do question-answering over super-long documents involving 1M tokens?

We have released [a fast RAG solution](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/assistant_rag.py), as well as [an expensive but competitive agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/parallel_doc_qa.py), for doing question-answering over super-long documents. They have managed to outperform native long-context models on two challenging benchmarks while being more efficient, and perform perfectly in the single-needle &quot;needle-in-the-haystack&quot; pressure test involving 1M-token contexts. See the [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-agent-2405/) for technical details.

## Study guide

&gt; Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).

![Imgur](images/OfVllex.png)

**Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?**

**A: No, you don&#039;t need to know everything here to prepare for the interview**.

What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

* How much experience you have
* What your technical background is
* What positions you are interviewing for
* Which companies you are interviewing with
* Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.

Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.
* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.
* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.

## How to approach a system design interview question

&gt; How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions

Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

### Step 2: Create a high level design

Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations

You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)
* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)
* [Latency numbers every programmer should know](#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)

## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you&#039;ll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](https://web.archive.org/web/20221030091841/http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](https://web.archive.org/web/20220530193911/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602114024/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126233752/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](https://web.archive.org/web/20220926171507/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we&#039;ll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we&#039;ll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.

## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

&lt;summary&gt;🤓 &lt;strong&gt;My Personal Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

My journey with computers started in childhood when my dad, a computer scientist, introduced me to an Amstrad computer. Those early days sparked a fascination with technology, leading me to pursue computer science and specialize in NLP during my postgraduate studies. It was during this time that I first delved into web crawling, building tools to help researchers organize papers and extract information from publications a challenging yet rewarding experience that honed my skills in data extraction.

Fast forward to 2023, I was working on a tool for a project and needed a crawler to convert a webpage into markdown. While exploring solutions, I found one that claimed to be open-source but required creating an account and generating an API token. Worse, it turned out to be a SaaS model charging $16, and its quality didn’t meet my standards. Frustrated, I realized this was a deeper problem. That frustration turned into turbo anger mode, and I decided to build my own solution. In just a few days, I created Crawl4AI. To my surprise, it went viral, earning thousands of GitHub stars and resonating with a global community.

I made Crawl4AI open-source for two reasons. First, it’s my way of giving back to the open-source community that has supported me throughout my career. Second, I believe data should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind paywalls or monopolized by a few. Open access to data lays the foundation for the democratization of AI, a vision where individuals can train their own models and take ownership of their information. This library is the first step in a larger journey to create the best open-source data extraction and generation tool the world has ever seen, built collaboratively by a passionate community.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this project, used it, and shared feedback. Your encouragement motivates me to dream even bigger. Join us, file issues, submit PRs, or spread the word. Together, we can build a tool that truly empowers people to access their own data and reshape the future of AI.
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 &lt;strong&gt;Using pip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup # Setup the browser
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the `crawl4ai-setup` should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. If the above doesn&#039;t work, try this more specific command:

   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

---

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode
```

Install optional features:

```bash
pip install -e &quot;.[torch]&quot;           # With PyTorch features
pip install -e &quot;.[transformer]&quot;     # With Transformer features
pip install -e &quot;.[cosine]&quot;          # With cosine similarity features
pip install -e &quot;.[sync]&quot;            # With synchronous crawling (Selenium)
pip install -e &quot;.[all]&quot;             # Install all optional features
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐳 &lt;strong&gt;Docker Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; 🚀 **Now Available!** Our completely redesigned Docker implementation is here! This new solution makes deployment more efficient and seamless than ever.

### New Docker Features

The new Docker implementation includes:
- **Browser pooling** with page pre-warming for faster response times
- **Interactive playground** to test and generate request code
- **MCP integration** for direct connection to AI tools like Claude Code
- **Comprehensive API endpoints** including HTML extraction, screenshots, PDF generation, and JavaScript execution
- **Multi-architecture support** with automatic detection (AMD64/ARM64)
- **Optimized resources** with improved memory management

### Getting Started

```bash
# Pull and run the latest release candidate
docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:0.6.0-rN # Use your favorite revision number
docker run -d -p 11235:11235 --name crawl4ai --shm-size=1g unclecode/crawl4ai:0.6.0-rN # Use your favorite revision number

# Visit the playground at http://localhost:11235/playground
```

For complete documentation, see our [Docker Deployment Guide](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/core/docker-deployment/).

&lt;/details&gt;

---

### Quick Test

Run a quick test (works for both Docker options):

```python
import requests

# Submit a crawl job
response = requests.post(
    &quot;http://localhost:11235/crawl&quot;,
    json={&quot;urls&quot;: &quot;https://example.com&quot;, &quot;priority&quot;: 10}
)
task_id = response.json()[&quot;task_id&quot;]

# Continue polling until the task is complete (status=&quot;completed&quot;)
result = requests.get(f&quot;http://localhost:11235/task/{task_id}&quot;)
```

Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it&#039;s possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it&#039;s not plug-and-play.

### Branches
| branch           | URL                                    | description                                                                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release3`         | openpilot.comma.ai                      | This is openpilot&#039;s release branch.                                                 |
| `release3-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`          | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`      | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide &lt;a name=&quot;quickstart&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Choose between our hosted platform or self-hosted package:

### Hosted Platform

Get up and running in minutes with automatic updates, analytics, and enterprise security.

1. Sign up on [Mem0 Platform](https://app.mem0.ai)
2. Embed the memory layer via SDK or API keys

### Self-Hosted (Open Source)

Install the sdk via pip:

```bash
pip install mem0ai
```

Install sdk via npm:
```bash
npm install mem0ai
```

### Basic Usage

Mem0 requires an LLM to function, with `gpt-4o-mini` from OpenAI as the default. However, it supports a variety of LLMs; for details, refer to our [Supported LLMs documentation](https://docs.mem0.ai/components/llms/overview).

First step is to instantiate the memory:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from mem0 import Memory

openai_client = OpenAI()
memory = Memory()

def chat_with_memories(message: str, user_id: str = &quot;default_user&quot;) -&gt; str:
    # Retrieve relevant memories
    relevant_memories = memory.search(query=message, user_id=user_id, limit=3)
    memories_str = &quot;\n&quot;.join(f&quot;- {entry[&#039;memory&#039;]}&quot; for entry in relevant_memories[&quot;results&quot;])

    # Generate Assistant response
    system_prompt = f&quot;You are a helpful AI. Answer the question based on query and memories.\nUser Memories:\n{memories_str}&quot;
    messages = [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: system_prompt}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: message}]
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;, messages=messages)
    assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Create new memories from the conversation
    messages.append({&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: assistant_response})
    memory.add(messages, user_id=user_id)

    return assistant_response

def main():
    print(&quot;Chat with AI (type &#039;exit&#039; to quit)&quot;)
    while True:
        user_input = input(&quot;You: &quot;).strip()
        if user_input.lower() == &#039;exit&#039;:
            print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
            break
        print(f&quot;AI: {chat_with_memories(user_input)}&quot;)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
```

```

### For end users

- **Clean &amp; Minimalistic UI**: A user-friendly interface for RAG-based QA.
- **Support for Various LLMs**: Compatible with LLM API providers (OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Cohere, etc.) and local LLMs (via `ollama` and `llama-cpp-python`).
- **Easy Installation**: Simple scripts to get you started quickly.

### For developers

- **Framework for RAG Pipelines**: Tools to build your own RAG-based document QA pipeline.
- **Customizable UI**: See your RAG pipeline in action with the provided UI, built with &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;Gradio &lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
- **Gradio Theme**: If you use Gradio for development, check out our theme here: [kotaemon-gradio-theme](https://github.com/lone17/kotaemon-gradio-theme).

## Key Features

- **Host your own document QA (RAG) web-UI**: Support multi-user login, organize your files in private/public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others.

- **Organize your LLM &amp; Embedding models**: Support both local LLMs &amp; popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq).

- **Hybrid RAG pipeline**: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text &amp; vector) retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality.

- **Multi-modal QA support**: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI).

- **Advanced citations with document preview**: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the _in-browser PDF viewer_ with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles.

- **Support complex reasoning methods**: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with `ReAct`, `ReWOO` and other agents.

- **Configurable settings UI**: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval &amp; generation process on the UI (incl. prompts).

- **Extensible**: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing &amp; retrieval. `GraphRAG` indexing pipeline is provided as an example.

## Installation

&gt; If you are not a developer and just want to use the app, please check out our easy-to-follow [User Guide](https://cinnamon.github.io/kotaemon/). Download the `.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/releases/latest) to get all the newest features and bug fixes.

### System requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) &gt;= 3.10
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): optional, if you [install with Docker](#with-docker-recommended)
3. [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation#full-installation) if you want to process files other than `.pdf`, `.html`, `.mhtml`, and `.xlsx` documents. Installation steps differ depending on your operating system. Please visit the link and follow the specific instructions provided there.

### With Docker (recommended)

1. We support both `lite` &amp; `full` version of Docker images. With `full` version, the extra packages of `unstructured` will be installed, which can support additional file types (`.doc`, `.docx`, ...) but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the `lite` image should work well in most cases.

   - To use the `full` version.

     ```bash
     docker run \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
     -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
     -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
     ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-full
     ```

   - To use the `full` version with bundled **Ollama** for _local / private RAG_.

     ```bash
     # change image name to
     docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-ollama
     ```

   - To use the `lite` version.

   ```bash
    # change image name to
    docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

2. We currently support and test two platforms: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (for newer Mac). You can specify the platform by passing `--platform` in the `docker run` command. For example:

   ```bash
   # To run docker with platform linux/arm64
   docker run \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
   -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
   -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
   --platform linux/arm64 \
   ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

3. Once everything is set up correctly, you can go to `http://localhost:7860/` to access the WebUI.

4. We use [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store docker images, all images can be found [here.](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/pkgs/container/kotaemon)

### Without Docker

1. Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment.

   ```shell
   # optional (setup env)
   conda create -n kotaemon python=3.10
   conda activate kotaemon

   # clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon
   cd kotaemon

   pip install -e &quot;libs/kotaemon[all]&quot;
   pip install -e &quot;libs/ktem&quot;
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of this project. Use `.env.example` as a template

   The `.env` file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app (e.g. deploy the app on HF hub). The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs.

3. (Optional) To enable in-browser `PDF_JS` viewer, download [PDF_JS_DIST](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v4.0.379/pdfjs-4.0.379-dist.zip) then extract it to `libs/ktem/ktem/assets/prebuilt`

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/pdf-viewer-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;pdf-setup&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;

4. Start the web server:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

   - The app will be automatically launched in your browser.
   - Default username and password are both `admin`. You can set up additional users directly through the UI.

   ![Chat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/chat-tab.png)

5. Check the `Resources` tab and `LLMs and Embeddings` and ensure that your `api_key` value is set correctly from your `.env` file. If it is not set, you can set it there.

### Setup GraphRAG

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Official MS GraphRAG indexing only works with OpenAI or Ollama API.
&gt; We recommend most users to use NanoGraphRAG implementation for straightforward integration with Kotaemon.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup Nano GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install nano-GraphRAG: `pip install nano-graphrag`
- `nano-graphrag` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_NANO_GRAPHRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from NanoGraphRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup LIGHTRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install LightRAG: `pip install git+https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git`
- `LightRAG` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_LIGHTRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from LightRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup MS GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- **Non-Docker Installation**: If you are not using Docker, install GraphRAG with the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install &quot;graphrag&lt;=0.3.6&quot; future
  ```

- **Setting Up API KEY**: To use the GraphRAG retriever feature, ensure you set the `GRAPHRAG_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this directly in your environment or by adding it to a `.env` file.
- **Using Local Models and Custom Settings**: If you want to use GraphRAG with local models (like `Ollama`) or customize the default LLM and other configurations, set the `USE_CUSTOMIZED_GRAPHRAG_SETTING` environment variable to true. Then, adjust your settings in the `settings.yaml.example` file.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Setup Local Models (for local/private RAG)

See [Local model setup](docs/local_model.md).

### Setup multimodal document parsing (OCR, table parsing, figure extraction)

These options are available:

- [Azure Document Intelligence (API)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
- [Adobe PDF Extract (API)](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/)
- [Docling (local, open-source)](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling)
  - To use Docling, first install required dependencies: `pip install docling`

Select corresponding loaders in `Settings -&gt; Retrieval Settings -&gt; File loader`

### Customize your application

- By default, all application data is stored in the `./ktem_app_data` folder. You can back up or copy this folder to transfer your installation to a new machine.

- For advanced users or specific use cases, you can customize these files:

  - `flowsettings.py`
  - `.env`

#### `flowsettings.py`

This file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example
[here](flowsettings.py) as the starting point.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Notable settings&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
# setup your preferred document store (with full-text search capabilities)
KH_DOCSTORE=(Elasticsearch | LanceDB | SimpleFileDocumentStore)

# setup your preferred vectorstore (for vector-based search)
KH_VECTORSTORE=(ChromaDB | LanceDB | InMemory | Milvus | Qdrant)

# Enable / disable multimodal QA
KH_REASONINGS_USE_MULTIMODAL=True

# Setup your new reasoning pipeline or modify existing one.
KH_REASONINGS = [
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullDecomposeQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.react.ReactAgentPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.rewoo.RewooAgentPipeline&quot;,
]
```

&lt;/details&gt;

#### `.env`

This file provides another way to configure your models and credentials.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Configure model via the .env file&lt;/summary&gt;

- Alternatively, you can configure the models via the `.env` file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in the folder of the application. If you don&#039;t see it, you can create one.

- Currently, the following providers are supported:

  - **OpenAI**

    In the `.env` file, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your OpenAI API key in order
    to enable access to OpenAI&#039;s models. There are other variables that can be modified,
    please feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should
    work for most people.

    ```shell
    OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
    OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your OpenAI API key here&gt;
    OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
    OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Azure OpenAI**

    For OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API
    key. Your might also need to provide your developments&#039; name for the chat model and the
    embedding model depending on how you set up Azure development.

    ```shell
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
    AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-35-turbo
    AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Local Models**

    - Using `ollama` OpenAI compatible server:

      - Install [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and start the application.

      - Pull your model, for example:

        ```shell
        ollama pull llama3.1:8b
        ollama pull nomic-embed-text
        ```

      - Set the model names on web UI and make it as default:

        ![Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/models.png)

    - Using `GGUF` with `llama-cpp-python`

      You can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Currently, these model formats are supported:

      - GGUF

        You should choose a model whose size is less than your device&#039;s memory and should leave
        about 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available,
        then you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to
        give better generation but also take more processing time.

        Here are some recommendations and their size in memory:

      - [Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen1_5-1_8b-chat-q8_0.gguf?download=true): around 2 GB

        Add a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web UI.

  &lt;/details&gt;

### Adding your own RAG pipeline

#### Custom Reasoning Pipeline

1. Check the default pipeline implementation in [here](libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/simple.py). You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work.
2. Add new `.py` implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/` and later include it in `flowssettings` to enable it on the UI.

#### Custom Indexing Pipeline

- Check sample implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/graph`

&gt; (more instruction WIP).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># What is the Live Agent Studio?

The [Live Agent Studio](https://studio.ottomator.ai) is a community-driven platform developed by [oTTomator](https://ottomator.ai) for you to explore cutting-edge AI agents and learn how to implement them for yourself or your business! All agents on this platform are open source and, over time, will cover a very large variety of use cases.

The goal with the studio is to build an educational platform for you to learn how to do incredible things with AI, while still providing practical value so that you’ll want to use the agents just for the sake of what they can do for you!

This platform is still in beta – expect longer response times under load, a rapidly growing agent library over the coming months, and a lot more content on this platform soon on Cole Medin’s YouTube channel!

# What is this Repository for?

This repository contains the source code/workflow JSON for all the agents on the Live Agent Studio! Every agent being added to the platform is currently be open sourced here so we can not only create a curated collection of cutting-edge agents together as a community, but also learn from one another!

## Tokens

Most agents on the Live Agent Studio cost tokens to use, which are purchasable on the platform. However, when you first sign in you are given some tokens to start so you can use the agents free of charge! The biggest reason agents cost tokens is that we pay for the LLM usage since we host all the agents developed by you and the rest of the community!

[Purchase Tokens](https://studio.ottomator.ai/pricing)

## Future Plans

As the Live Agent Studio develops, it will become the go-to place to stay on top of what is possible with AI agents! Anytime there is a new AI technology, groundbreaking agent research, or a new tool/library to build agents with, it’ll be featured through agents on the platform. It’s a tall order, but we have big plans for the oTTomator community, and we’re confident we can grow to accomplish this!

## FAQ

### I want to build an agent to showcase in the Live Agent Studio! How do I do that?

Head on over here to learn how to build an agent for the platform:

[Developer Guide](https://studio.ottomator.ai/guide)

Also check out [the sample n8n agent](~sample-n8n-agent~) for a starting point of building an n8n agent for the Live Agent Studio, and [the sample Python agent](~sample-python-agent~) for Python.

### How many tokens does it cost to use an agent?

Each agent will charge tokens per prompt. The number of tokens depends on the agent, as some agents use larger LLMs, some call LLMs multiple times, and some use paid APIs.

### Where can I go to talk about all these agents and get help implementing them myself?

Head on over to our Think Tank community and feel free to make a post!

# Purple Llama

Purple Llama is an umbrella project that over time will bring together tools
and evals to help the community build responsibly with open generative AI
models. The initial release will include tools and evals for Cyber Security and
Input/Output safeguards but we plan to contribute more in the near future.

## Why purple?

Borrowing a [concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_Fdp6FVDI) from the
cybersecurity world, we believe that to truly mitigate the challenges which
generative AI presents, we need to take both attack (red team) and defensive
(blue team) postures. Purple teaming, composed of both red and blue team
responsibilities, is a collaborative approach to evaluating and mitigating
potential risks and the same ethos applies to generative AI and hence our
investment in Purple Llama will be comprehensive.

## License

Components within the Purple Llama project will be licensed permissively enabling both research and commercial usage.
We believe this is a major step towards enabling community collaboration and standardizing the development and usage of trust and safety tools for generative AI development.
More concretely evals and benchmarks are licensed under the MIT license while any models use the corresponding Llama Community license. See the table below:

| **Component Type** |            **Components**            |                                          **License**                                           |

## System-Level Safeguards

As we outlined in Llama 3’s
[Responsible Use Guide](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/), we
recommend that all inputs and outputs to the LLM be checked and filtered in
accordance with content guidelines appropriate to the application.

### Llama Guard

Llama Guard 3 consists of a series of high-performance input and output moderation models designed to support developers to detect various common types of violating content.

They were built by fine-tuning Meta-Llama 3.1 and 3.2 models and optimized to support the detection of the MLCommons standard hazards taxonomy, catering to a range of developer use cases.
They support the release of Llama 3.2 capabilities, including 7 new languages, a 128k context window, and image reasoning. Llama Guard 3 models were also optimized to detect helpful cyberattack responses and prevent malicious code output by LLMs to be executed in hosting environments for Llama systems using code interpreters.


### Prompt Guard
Prompt Guard is a powerful tool for protecting LLM powered applications from malicious prompts to ensure their security and integrity.

Categories of prompt attacks include prompt injection and jailbreaking:

* Prompt Injections are inputs that exploit the inclusion of untrusted data from third parties into the context window of a model to get it to execute unintended instructions.
* Jailbreaks are malicious instructions designed to override the safety and security features built into a model.

### Code Shield

Code Shield adds support for inference-time filtering of insecure code produced by LLMs. Code Shield offers mitigation of insecure code suggestions risk, code interpreter abuse prevention, and secure command execution. [CodeShield Example Notebook](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/CodeShield/notebook/CodeShieldUsageDemo.ipynb).



## Evals &amp; Benchmarks

### Cybersecurity

#### CyberSec Eval v1
CyberSec Eval v1 was what we believe was the first industry-wide set of cybersecurity safety evaluations for LLMs. These benchmarks are based on industry guidance and standards (e.g., CWE and MITRE ATT&amp;CK) and built in collaboration with our security subject matter experts. We aim to provide tools that will help address some risks outlined in the [White House commitments on developing responsible AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/), including:
* Metrics for quantifying LLM cybersecurity risks.
* Tools to evaluate the frequency of insecure code suggestions.
* Tools to evaluate LLMs to make it harder to generate malicious code or aid in carrying out cyberattacks.

We believe these tools will reduce the frequency of LLMs suggesting insecure AI-generated code and reduce their helpfulness to cyber adversaries. Our initial results show that there are meaningful cybersecurity risks for LLMs, both with recommending insecure code and for complying with malicious requests. See our [Cybersec Eval paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/purple-llama-cyberseceval-a-benchmark-for-evaluating-the-cybersecurity-risks-of-large-language-models/) for more details.

#### CyberSec Eval 2
CyberSec Eval 2 expands on its predecessor by measuring an LLM’s propensity to abuse a code interpreter, offensive cybersecurity capabilities, and susceptibility to prompt injection. You can read the paper [here](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cyberseceval-2-a-wide-ranging-cybersecurity-evaluation-suite-for-large-language-models/).

You can also check out the 🤗 leaderboard [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/CyberSecEval).

#### CyberSec Eval 3
The newly released CyberSec Eval 3 features three additional test suites: visual prompt injection tests, spear phishing capability tests, and autonomous offensive cyber operations tests.

## Getting Started

As part of the [Llama reference system](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system), we’re integrating a safety layer to facilitate adoption and deployment of these safeguards.
Resources to get started with the safeguards are available in the [Llama-recipe GitHub repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes).

### Modified Assistive Driving Safety (MADS)
The goal of Modified Assistive Driving Safety (MADS) is to enhance the user driving experience with modified behaviors of driving assist engagements. This feature complies with comma.ai&#039;s safety rules as accurately as possible with the following changes:
* sunnypilot Automatic Lane Centering (ALC) and ACC/SCC can be engaged independently of each other
* Dedicated button to toggle sunnypilot ALC:
    * `CRUISE (MAIN)` button: All supported cars on sunnypilot
        * `LFA` button: Newer HKG cars with `LFA` button
        * `LKAS` button: Honda, Toyota, Global Subaru
* `SET-` button enables ACC/SCC
* `CANCEL` button only disables ACC/SCC
* `CRUISE (MAIN)` must be `ON` to use ACC/SCC
* `CRUISE (MAIN)` button disables sunnypilot completely when `OFF` **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**

### Disengage Lateral ALC on Brake Press Mode toggle
Dedicated toggle to handle Lateral state on brake pedal press and release:
1. `ON`: `BRAKE pedal` press will pause Automatic Lane Centering; `BRAKE pedal` release will resume Automatic Lane Centering. Note: `BRAKE pedal` release will NOT resume ACC/SCC/Long control without explicit user engagement **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**
2. `OFF`: `BRAKE pedal` press will NOT pause Automatic Lane Centering; `BRAKE pedal` release will NOT resume ACC/SCC/Long control without explicit user engagement **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**

### Miscellaneous
* `TURN SIGNALS` (`Left` or `Right`) will pause Automatic Lane Centering if the vehicle speed is below the [threshold](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/selfdrive/controls/lib/desire_helper.py#L8) for Automatic Lane Change
* Event audible alerts are more relaxed to match manufacturer&#039;s stock behavior
* Critical events trigger disengagement of Automatic Lane Centering completely. The disengagement is enforced in sunnypilot and panda safety

### Dynamic Lane Profile (DLP)

Dynamic Lane Profile (DLP) aims to provide the best driving experience at staying within a lane confidently. Dynamic Lane Profile allows sunnypilot to dynamically switch between lane profiles based on lane recognition confidence level on road.

There are 3 modes to select on the onroad camera screen:
* **Auto Lane**: sunnypilot dynamically chooses between `Laneline` or `Laneless` model
* **Laneline**: sunnypilot uses Laneline model only.
* **Laneless**: sunnypilot uses Laneless model only.

To use Dynamic Lane Profile, do the following:
```
1. sunnypilot Settings -&gt; `SP - Controls` -&gt; Enable Dynamic Lane Profile -&gt; ON toggle
2. Reboot.
3. Before driving, on the onroad camera screen, toggle between the 3 modes by pressing on the button.
4. Drive.
```

### Enhanced Speed Control
This fork now allows supported cars to dynamically adjust the longitudinal plan based on the fetched map data. Big thanks to the Move Fast team for the amazing implementation!

**Supported cars:**
* sunnypilot Longitudinal Control capable
* Stock Longitudinal Control
    * Hyundai/Kia/Genesis (non CAN-FD)

**Features:**
* Vision-based Turn Speed Control (VTSC) - Use vision path predictions to estimate the appropriate speed to drive through turns ahead - i.e. slowing down for curves
* Map-Data-based Turn Speed Control (MTSC) - Use curvature information from map data to define speed limits to take turns ahead - i.e. slowing down for curves[^1]
* Speed Limit Control (SLC) - Use speed limit signs information from map data and car interface to automatically adapt cruise speed to road limits
    * HKG only: Highway Driving Assist (HDA) status integration - on applicable HKG cars only[^1]
    * Speed Limit Offset - When Speed Limit Control is enabled, set speed limit slightly higher than the actual speed limit for a more natural drive[^1]
* Toggle Hands on Wheel Monitoring - Monitors and alerts the driver when their hands have not been on the steering wheel for an extended time

### Custom Stock Longitudinal Control
While using stock Adaptive/Smart Cruise Control, Custom Stock Longitudinal Control in sunnypilot allows sunnypilot to manipulate and take over the set speed on the car&#039;s dashboard.

**Supported Cars:**
* Hyundai/Kia/Genesis
    * CAN platform
    * CAN-FD platform with 0x1CF broadcasted in CAN traffic
* Honda Bosch
* Volkswagen MQB

**Instruction**

**📗 How to use Custom Longitudinal Control on sunnypilot **

When using Speed Limit, Vision, or Map based Turn control, you will be setting the &quot;MAX&quot; ACC speed on the sunnypilot display instead of the one in the dashboard. The car will then set the ACC setting in the dashboard to the targeted speed, but will never exceed the max speed set on the sunnypilot display. A quick press of the RES+ or SET- buttons will change this speed by 5 MPH or KM/H on the sunnypilot display, while a long deliberate press (about a 1/2 second press) changes it by 1 MPH or KM/H. DO NOT hold the RES+ or SET- buttons for longer that a 1 second. Either make quick or long deliberate presses only.

**‼ Where to look when setting ACC speed ‼**

Do not look at the dashboard when setting your ACC max speed. Instead, only look at the one on the sunnypilot display, &quot;MAX&quot;. The reason you need to look at the sunnypilot display is because sunnypilot will be changing the one in the dashboard. It will be adjusting it as needed, never raising it above the one set on the sunnypilot display. ONLY look at the MAX speed on the sunnypilot display when setting the ACC speed instead of the dashboard!
