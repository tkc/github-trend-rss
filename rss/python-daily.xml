            <h2>README</h2><pre># MarkItDown

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/markitdown.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)
![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/markitdown)
[![Built by AutoGen Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-AutoGen%20Team-blue)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0:
&gt; * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;` to have backward-compatible behavior. 
&gt; * convert\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO.
&gt; * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. *No temporary files are created anymore*. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.

MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.

MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:

- PDF
- PowerPoint
- Word
- Excel
- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)
- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- HTML
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP files (iterates over contents)
- Youtube URLs
- EPubs
- ... and more!

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still
provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as
OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4o, natively &quot;_speak_&quot; Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their
responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of
Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions
are also highly token-efficient.

## Prerequisites
MarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use &#039;uv pip install&#039; rather than just &#039;pip install&#039; to install packages in this virtual environment
```

If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown
```

## Installation

To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git
cd markitdown
pip install -e &#039;packages/markitdown[all]&#039;
```

## Usage

### Command-Line

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf &gt; document.md
```

Or use `-o` to specify the output file:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md
```

You can also pipe content:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

### Optional Dependencies
MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:

```bash
pip install &#039;markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]&#039;
```

will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:

* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies
* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files
* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files
* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files
* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files
* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files
* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages
* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence
* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files
* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription

### Plugins

MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins
```

To enable plugins use:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf
```

To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.

### Azure Document Intelligence

To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e &quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;
```

More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)

### Python API

Basic usage in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert(&quot;test.xlsx&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

Document Intelligence conversion in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=&quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;test.pdf&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

To use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;, llm_prompt=&quot;optional custom prompt&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;example.jpg&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t markitdown:latest .
docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest &lt; ~/your-file.pdf &gt; output.md
```

&gt; On February 28th, 2026, DeerFlow claimed the 🏆 #1 spot on GitHub Trending following the launch of version 2. Thanks a million to our incredible community — you made this happen! 💪🔥

DeerFlow (**D**eep **E**xploration and **E**fficient **R**esearch **Flow**) is an open-source **super agent harness** that orchestrates **sub-agents**, **memory**, and **sandboxes** to do almost anything — powered by **extensible skills**.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8bcadc4-e040-4cf2-8fda-dd768b999c18

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; **DeerFlow 2.0 is a ground-up rewrite.** It shares no code with v1. If you&#039;re looking for the original Deep Research framework, it&#039;s maintained on the [`1.x` branch](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/tree/main-1.x) — contributions there are still welcome. Active development has moved to 2.0.

## Quick Start

### Configuration

1. **Clone the DeerFlow repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
   cd deer-flow
   ```

2. **Generate local configuration files**

   From the project root directory (`deer-flow/`), run:

   ```bash
   make config
   ```

   This command creates local configuration files based on the provided example templates.

3. **Configure your preferred model(s)**

   Edit `config.yaml` and define at least one model:

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-4                       # Internal identifier
       display_name: GPT-4               # Human-readable name
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI  # LangChain class path
       model: gpt-4                      # Model identifier for API
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY          # API key (recommended: use env var)
       max_tokens: 4096                  # Maximum tokens per request
       temperature: 0.7                  # Sampling temperature
   ```

  
4. **Set API keys for your configured model(s)**

   Choose one of the following methods:

- Option A: Edit the `.env` file in the project root (Recommended)


   ```bash
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   # Add other provider keys as needed
   ```

- Option B: Export environment variables in your shell

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

- Option C: Edit `config.yaml` directly (Not recommended for production)

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-4
       api_key: your-actual-api-key-here  # Replace placeholder
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started with a consistent environment:

1. **Initialize and start**:
   ```bash
   make docker-init    # Pull sandbox image (Only once or when image updates)
   make docker-start   # Start services (auto-detects sandbox mode from config.yaml)
   ```

   `make docker-start` now starts `provisioner` only when `config.yaml` uses provisioner mode (`sandbox.use: src.community.aio_sandbox:AioSandboxProvider` with `provisioner_url`).

2. **Access**: http://localhost:2026

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed Docker development guide.

#### Option 2: Local Development

If you prefer running services locally:

1. **Check prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   make check  # Verifies Node.js 22+, pnpm, uv, nginx
   ```

2. **(Optional) Pre-pull sandbox image**:
   ```bash
   # Recommended if using Docker/Container-based sandbox
   make setup-sandbox
   ```

3. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

4. **Access**: http://localhost:2026

### Advanced
#### Sandbox Mode

DeerFlow supports multiple sandbox execution modes:
- **Local Execution** (runs sandbox code directly on the host machine)
- **Docker Execution** (runs sandbox code in isolated Docker containers)
- **Docker Execution with Kubernetes** (runs sandbox code in Kubernetes pods via provisioner service)

For Docker development, service startup follows `config.yaml` sandbox mode. In Local/Docker modes, `provisioner` is not started.

See the [Sandbox Configuration Guide](backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#sandbox) to configure your preferred mode.

#### MCP Server

DeerFlow supports configurable MCP servers and skills to extend its capabilities.
For HTTP/SSE MCP servers, OAuth token flows are supported (`client_credentials`, `refresh_token`).
See the [MCP Server Guide](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md) for detailed instructions.

## From Deep Research to Super Agent Harness

DeerFlow started as a Deep Research framework — and the community ran with it. Since launch, developers have pushed it far beyond research: building data pipelines, generating slide decks, spinning up dashboards, automating content workflows. Things we never anticipated.

That told us something important: DeerFlow wasn&#039;t just a research tool. It was a **harness** — a runtime that gives agents the infrastructure to actually get work done.

So we rebuilt it from scratch.

DeerFlow 2.0 is no longer a framework you wire together. It&#039;s a super agent harness — batteries included, fully extensible. Built on LangGraph and LangChain, it ships with everything an agent needs out of the box: a filesystem, memory, skills, sandboxed execution, and the ability to plan and spawn sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.

Use it as-is. Or tear it apart and make it yours.

## Core Features

### Skills &amp; Tools

Skills are what make DeerFlow do *almost anything*.

A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.

Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.

Tools follow the same philosophy. DeerFlow comes with a core toolset — web search, web fetch, file operations, bash execution — and supports custom tools via MCP servers and Python functions. Swap anything. Add anything.

```
# Paths inside the sandbox container
/mnt/skills/public
├── research/SKILL.md
├── report-generation/SKILL.md
├── slide-creation/SKILL.md
├── web-page/SKILL.md
└── image-generation/SKILL.md

/mnt/skills/custom
└── your-custom-skill/SKILL.md      ← yours
```

### Sub-Agents

Complex tasks rarely fit in a single pass. DeerFlow decomposes them.

The lead agent can spawn sub-agents on the fly — each with its own scoped context, tools, and termination conditions. Sub-agents run in parallel when possible, report back structured results, and the lead agent synthesizes everything into a coherent output.

This is how DeerFlow handles tasks that take minutes to hours: a research task might fan out into a dozen sub-agents, each exploring a different angle, then converge into a single report — or a website — or a slide deck with generated visuals. One harness, many hands.

### Sandbox &amp; File System

DeerFlow doesn&#039;t just *talk* about doing things. It has its own computer.

Each task runs inside an isolated Docker container with a full filesystem — skills, workspace, uploads, outputs. The agent reads, writes, and edits files. It executes bash commands and codes. It views images. All sandboxed, all auditable, zero contamination between sessions.

This is the difference between a chatbot with tool access and an agent with an actual execution environment.

```
# Paths inside the sandbox container
/mnt/user-data/
├── uploads/          ← your files
├── workspace/        ← agents&#039; working directory
└── outputs/          ← final deliverables
```

### Context Engineering

**Isolated Sub-Agent Context**: Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated context. This means that the sub-agent will not be able to see the context of the main agent or other sub-agents. This is important to ensure that the sub-agent is able to focus on the task at hand and not be distracted by the context of the main agent or other sub-agents.

**Summarization**: Within a session, DeerFlow manages context aggressively — summarizing completed sub-tasks, offloading intermediate results to the filesystem, compressing what&#039;s no longer immediately relevant. This lets it stay sharp across long, multi-step tasks without blowing the context window.

### Long-Term Memory

Most agents forget everything the moment a conversation ends. DeerFlow remembers.

Across sessions, DeerFlow builds a persistent memory of your profile, preferences, and accumulated knowledge. The more you use it, the better it knows you — your writing style, your technical stack, your recurring workflows. Memory is stored locally and stays under your control.

## Recommended Models

DeerFlow is model-agnostic — it works with any LLM that implements the OpenAI-compatible API. That said, it performs best with models that support:

- **Long context windows** (100k+ tokens) for deep research and multi-step tasks
- **Reasoning capabilities** for adaptive planning and complex decomposition
- **Multimodal inputs** for image understanding and video comprehension
- **Strong tool-use** for reliable function calling and structured outputs

## Embedded Python Client

DeerFlow can be used as an embedded Python library without running the full HTTP services. The `DeerFlowClient` provides direct in-process access to all agent and Gateway capabilities, returning the same response schemas as the HTTP Gateway API:

```python
from src.client import DeerFlowClient

client = DeerFlowClient()

# Chat
response = client.chat(&quot;Analyze this paper for me&quot;, thread_id=&quot;my-thread&quot;)

# Streaming (LangGraph SSE protocol: values, messages-tuple, end)
for event in client.stream(&quot;hello&quot;):
    if event.type == &quot;messages-tuple&quot; and event.data.get(&quot;type&quot;) == &quot;ai&quot;:
        print(event.data[&quot;content&quot;])

# Configuration &amp; management — returns Gateway-aligned dicts
models = client.list_models()        # {&quot;models&quot;: [...]}
skills = client.list_skills()        # {&quot;skills&quot;: [...]}
client.update_skill(&quot;web-search&quot;, enabled=True)
client.upload_files(&quot;thread-1&quot;, [&quot;./report.pdf&quot;])  # {&quot;success&quot;: True, &quot;files&quot;: [...]}
```

All dict-returning methods are validated against Gateway Pydantic response models in CI (`TestGatewayConformance`), ensuring the embedded client stays in sync with the HTTP API schemas. See `backend/src/client.py` for full API documentation.

[Document](https://open-sandbox.ai/) | [文档](https://open-sandbox.ai/zh/)

OpenSandbox is a **general-purpose sandbox platform** for AI applications, offering multi-language SDKs, unified sandbox APIs, and Docker/Kubernetes runtimes for scenarios like Coding Agents, GUI Agents, Agent Evaluation, AI Code Execution, and RL Training.

## Features

- **Multi-language SDKs**: Provides sandbox SDKs in Python, Java/Kotlin, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#/.NET, Go (Roadmap), and more.
- **Sandbox Protocol**: Defines sandbox lifecycle management APIs and sandbox execution APIs so you can extend custom sandbox runtimes.
- **Sandbox Runtime**: Built-in lifecycle management supporting Docker and [high-performance Kubernetes runtime](./kubernetes), enabling both local runs and large-scale distributed scheduling.
- **Sandbox Environments**: Built-in Command, Filesystem, and Code Interpreter implementations. Examples cover Coding Agents (e.g., Claude Code), browser automation (Chrome, Playwright), and desktop environments (VNC, VS Code).
- **Network Policy**: Unified [Ingress Gateway](components/ingress) with multiple routing strategies plus per-sandbox [egress controls](components/egress).

## Examples

### Basic Sandbox Operations

Requirements:

- Docker (required for local execution)
- Python 3.10+ (recommended for examples and local runtime)

#### 1. Install and Configure the Sandbox Server

```bash
uv pip install opensandbox-server
opensandbox-server init-config ~/.sandbox.toml --example docker
```

&gt; If you prefer working from source, you can still clone the repo for development, but server startup no longer requires it.
&gt;
&gt; ```bash
&gt; git clone https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox.git
&gt; cd OpenSandbox/server
&gt; uv sync
&gt; cp example.config.toml ~/.sandbox.toml # Copy configuration file
&gt; uv run python -m src.main # Start the service
&gt; ```

#### 2. Start the Sandbox Server

```bash
opensandbox-server

# Show help
opensandbox-server -h
```

#### 3. Create a Code Interpreter and Execute Commands

Install the Code Interpreter SDK

```bash
uv pip install opensandbox-code-interpreter
```

Create a sandbox and execute commands

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import timedelta

from code_interpreter import CodeInterpreter, SupportedLanguage
from opensandbox import Sandbox
from opensandbox.models import WriteEntry

async def main() -&gt; None:
    # 1. Create a sandbox
    sandbox = await Sandbox.create(
        &quot;opensandbox/code-interpreter:v1.0.1&quot;,
        entrypoint=[&quot;/opt/opensandbox/code-interpreter.sh&quot;],
        env={&quot;PYTHON_VERSION&quot;: &quot;3.11&quot;},
        timeout=timedelta(minutes=10),
    )

    async with sandbox:

        # 2. Execute a shell command
        execution = await sandbox.commands.run(&quot;echo &#039;Hello OpenSandbox!&#039;&quot;)
        print(execution.logs.stdout[0].text)

        # 3. Write a file
        await sandbox.files.write_files([
            WriteEntry(path=&quot;/tmp/hello.txt&quot;, data=&quot;Hello World&quot;, mode=644)
        ])

        # 4. Read a file
        content = await sandbox.files.read_file(&quot;/tmp/hello.txt&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Content: {content}&quot;) # Content: Hello World

        # 5. Create a code interpreter
        interpreter = await CodeInterpreter.create(sandbox)

        # 6. Execute Python code (single-run, pass language directly)
        result = await interpreter.codes.run(
              &quot;&quot;&quot;
                  import sys
                  print(sys.version)
                  result = 2 + 2
                  result
              &quot;&quot;&quot;,
              language=SupportedLanguage.PYTHON,
        )

        print(result.result[0].text) # 4
        print(result.logs.stdout[0].text) # 3.11.14

    # 7. Cleanup the sandbox
    await sandbox.kill()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🎯 Getting Started

Claude Scientific Skills follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard. Simply copy the skill folders into your skills directory and your AI agent will automatically discover and use them.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills.git
```

### Step 2: Copy Skills to Your Skills Directory

Copy the individual skill folders from `scientific-skills/` to one of the supported skill directories below. You can install skills **globally** (available across all projects) or **per-project** (available only in that project).

**Global installation** (recommended — skills available everywhere):

| Tool | Directory |
|------|-----------|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` |

**Project-level installation** (skills scoped to a single project):

| Tool | Directory |
|------|-----------|
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` (in your project root) |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` (in your project root) |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` (in your project root) |

&gt; **Note:** Cursor also reads from `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/` directories, and vice versa, so skills are cross-compatible between tools.

**Example — global install for Cursor:**
```bash
cp -r claude-scientific-skills/scientific-skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/
```

**Example — global install for Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r claude-scientific-skills/scientific-skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Example — project-level install:**
```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/skills
cp -r /path/to/claude-scientific-skills/scientific-skills/* .cursor/skills/
```

**That&#039;s it!** Your AI agent will automatically discover the skills and use them when relevant to your scientific tasks. You can also invoke any skill manually by mentioning the skill name in your prompt.

## 🎯 项目介绍

&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;如果说 2024 年是&quot;百模大战&quot;的元年，那么 2025 年无疑开启了&quot;Agent 元年&quot;。技术的焦点正从训练更大的基础模型，转向构建更聪明的智能体应用。然而，当前系统性、重实践的教程却极度匮乏。为此，我们发起了 Hello-Agents 项目，希望能为社区提供一本从零开始、理论与实战并重的智能体系统构建指南。

&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;Hello-Agents 是 Datawhale 社区的&lt;strong&gt;系统性智能体学习教程&lt;/strong&gt;。如今 Agent 构建主要分为两派，一派是 Dify，Coze，n8n 这类软件工程类 Agent，其本质是流程驱动的软件开发，LLM 作为数据处理的后端；另一派则是 AI 原生的 Agent，即真正以 AI 驱动的 Agent。本教程旨在带领大家深入理解并构建后者——真正的 AI Native Agent。教程将带领你穿透框架表象，从智能体的核心原理出发，深入其核心架构，理解其经典范式，并最终亲手构建起属于自己的多智能体应用。我们相信，最好的学习方式就是动手实践。希望这本教程能成为你探索智能体世界的起点，能够从一名大语言模型的&quot;使用者&quot;，蜕变为一名智能体系统的&quot;构建者&quot;。

## 💡 如何学习

&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;欢迎你，未来的智能系统构建者！在开启这段激动人心的旅程之前，请允许我们给你一些清晰的指引。

&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;本项目内容兼顾理论与实战，旨在帮助你系统性地掌握从单个智能体到多智能体系统的设计与开发全流程。因此，尤其适合有一定编程基础的 &lt;strong&gt;AI 开发者、软件工程师、在校学生&lt;/strong&gt; 以及对前沿 AI 技术抱有浓厚兴趣的 &lt;strong&gt;自学者&lt;/strong&gt;。在学习本项目之前，我们希望你具备基础的 Python 编程能力，并对大语言模型有基本的概念性了解（例如，知道如何通过 API 调用一个 LLM）。项目的重点是应用与构建，因此你无需具备深厚的算法或模型训练背景。

&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;项目分为五大部分，每一部分都是通往下一阶段的坚实阶梯：

- &lt;strong&gt;第一部分：智能体与语言模型基础&lt;/strong&gt;（第一章～第三章），我们将从智能体的定义、类型与发展历史讲起，为你梳理&quot;智能体&quot;这一概念的来龙去脉。随后，我们会快速巩固大语言模型的核心知识，为你的实践之旅打下坚实的理论地基。

- &lt;strong&gt;第二部分：构建你的大语言模型智能体&lt;/strong&gt;（第四章～第七章），这是你动手实践的起点。你将亲手实现 ReAct 等经典范式，体验 Coze 等低代码平台的便捷，并掌握 Langgraph 等主流框架的应用。最终，我们还会带你从零开始构建一个属于自己的智能体框架，让你兼具“用轮子”与“造轮子”的能力。

- &lt;strong&gt;第三部分：高级知识扩展&lt;/strong&gt;（第八章～第十二章），在这一部分，你的智能体将“学会”思考与协作。我们将使用第二部分的自研框架，深入探索记忆与检索、上下文工程、Agent 训练等核心技术，并学习多智能体间的通信协议。最终，你将掌握评估智能体系统性能的专业方法。

- &lt;strong&gt;第四部分：综合案例进阶&lt;/strong&gt;（第十三章～第十五章），这里是理论与实践的交汇点。你将把所学融会贯通，亲手打造智能旅行助手、自动化深度研究智能体，乃至一个模拟社会动态的赛博小镇，在真实有趣的项目中淬炼你的构建能力。

- &lt;strong&gt;第五部分：毕业设计及未来展望&lt;/strong&gt;（第十六章），在旅程的终点，你将迎来一个毕业设计，构建一个完整的、属于你自己的多智能体应用，全面检验你的学习成果。我们还将与你一同展望智能体的未来，探索激动人心的前沿方向。


&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;智能体是一个飞速发展且极度依赖实践的领域。为了获得最佳的学习效果，我们在项目的`code`文件夹内提供了配套的全部代码，强烈建议你&lt;strong&gt;将理论与实践相结合&lt;/strong&gt;。请务必亲手运行、调试甚至修改项目里提供的每一份代码。欢迎你随时关注 Datawhale 以及其他 Agent 相关社区，当遇到问题时，你可以随时在本项目的 issue 区提问。

&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;现在，准备好进入智能体的奇妙世界了吗？让我们即刻启程！

## 🗃️ Memory as File System, File System as Memory

memU treats **memory like a file system**—structured, hierarchical, and instantly accessible.

| File System | memU Memory |
|-------------|-------------|
| 📁 Folders | 🏷️ Categories (auto-organized topics) |
| 📄 Files | 🧠 Memory Items (extracted facts, preferences, skills) |
| 🔗 Symlinks | 🔄 Cross-references (related memories linked) |
| 📂 Mount points | 📥 Resources (conversations, documents, images) |

**Why this matters:**
- **Navigate memories** like browsing directories—drill down from broad categories to specific facts
- **Mount new knowledge** instantly—conversations and documents become queryable memory
- **Cross-link everything**—memories reference each other, building a connected knowledge graph
- **Persistent &amp; portable**—export, backup, and transfer memory like files

```
memory/
├── preferences/
│   ├── communication_style.md
│   └── topic_interests.md
├── relationships/
│   ├── contacts/
│   └── interaction_history/
├── knowledge/
│   ├── domain_expertise/
│   └── learned_skills/
└── context/
    ├── recent_conversations/
    └── pending_tasks/
```

Just as a file system turns raw bytes into organized data, memU transforms raw interactions into **structured, searchable, proactive intelligence**.

## 🎯 Proactive Use Cases

### 1. **Information Recommendation**
*Agent monitors interests and proactively surfaces relevant content*
```python
# User has been researching AI topics
MemU tracks: reading history, saved articles, search queries

# When new content arrives:
Agent: &quot;I found 3 new papers on RAG optimization that align with
        your recent research on retrieval systems. One author
        (Dr. Chen) you&#039;ve cited before published yesterday.&quot;

# Proactive behaviors:
- Learns topic preferences from browsing patterns
- Tracks author/source credibility preferences
- Filters noise based on engagement history
- Times recommendations for optimal attention
```

### 2. **Email Management**
*Agent learns communication patterns and handles routine correspondence*
```python
# MemU observes email patterns over time:
- Response templates for common scenarios
- Priority contacts and urgent keywords
- Scheduling preferences and availability
- Writing style and tone variations

# Proactive email assistance:
Agent: &quot;You have 12 new emails. I&#039;ve drafted responses for 3 routine
        requests and flagged 2 urgent items from your priority contacts.
        Should I also reschedule tomorrow&#039;s meeting based on the
        conflict John mentioned?&quot;

# Autonomous actions:
✓ Draft context-aware replies
✓ Categorize and prioritize inbox
✓ Detect scheduling conflicts
✓ Summarize long threads with key decisions
```

### 3. **Trading &amp; Financial Monitoring**
*Agent tracks market context and user investment behavior*
```python
# MemU learns trading preferences:
- Risk tolerance from historical decisions
- Preferred sectors and asset classes
- Response patterns to market events
- Portfolio rebalancing triggers

# Proactive alerts:
Agent: &quot;NVDA dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Based on your past
        behavior, you typically buy tech dips above 3%. Your current
        allocation allows for $2,000 additional exposure while
        maintaining your 70/30 equity-bond target.&quot;

# Continuous monitoring:
- Track price alerts tied to user-defined thresholds
- Correlate news events with portfolio impact
- Learn from executed vs. ignored recommendations
- Anticipate tax-loss harvesting opportunities
```

## 🗂️ Hierarchical Memory Architecture

MemU&#039;s three-layer system enables both **reactive queries** and **proactive context loading**:

&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;structure&quot; src=&quot;assets/structure.png&quot; /&gt;

| Layer | Reactive Use | Proactive Use |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Resource** | Direct access to original data | Background monitoring for new patterns |
| **Item** | Targeted fact retrieval | Real-time extraction from ongoing interactions |
| **Category** | Summary-level overview | Automatic context assembly for anticipation |

**Proactive Benefits:**
- **Auto-categorization**: New memories self-organize into topics
- **Pattern Detection**: System identifies recurring themes
- **Context Prediction**: Anticipates what information will be needed next

## 📖 Core APIs

### `memorize()` - Continuous Learning Pipeline

Processes inputs in real-time and immediately updates memory:

&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;memorize&quot; src=&quot;assets/memorize.png&quot; /&gt;

```python
result = await service.memorize(
    resource_url=&quot;path/to/file.json&quot;,  # File path or URL
    modality=&quot;conversation&quot;,            # conversation | document | image | video | audio
    user={&quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;123&quot;}             # Optional: scope to a user
)

# Returns immediately with extracted memory:
{
    &quot;resource&quot;: {...},      # Stored resource metadata
    &quot;items&quot;: [...],         # Extracted memory items (available instantly)
    &quot;categories&quot;: [...]     # Auto-updated category structure
}
```

**Proactive Features:**
- Zero-delay processing—memories available immediately
- Automatic categorization without manual tagging
- Cross-reference with existing memories for pattern detection

### `retrieve()` - Dual-Mode Intelligence

MemU supports both **proactive context loading** and **reactive querying**:

&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;retrieve&quot; src=&quot;assets/retrieve.png&quot; /&gt;

#### RAG-based Retrieval (`method=&quot;rag&quot;`)

Fast **proactive context assembly** using embeddings:

- ✅ **Instant context**: Sub-second memory surfacing
- ✅ **Background monitoring**: Can run continuously without LLM costs
- ✅ **Similarity scoring**: Identifies most relevant memories automatically

#### LLM-based Retrieval (`method=&quot;llm&quot;`)

Deep **anticipatory reasoning** for complex contexts:

- ✅ **Intent prediction**: LLM infers what user needs before they ask
- ✅ **Query evolution**: Automatically refines search as context develops
- ✅ **Early termination**: Stops when sufficient context is gathered

#### Comparison

| Aspect | RAG (Fast Context) | LLM (Deep Reasoning) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | ⚡ Milliseconds | 🐢 Seconds |
| **Cost** | 💰 Embedding only | 💰💰 LLM inference |
| **Proactive use** | Continuous monitoring | Triggered context loading |
| **Best for** | Real-time suggestions | Complex anticipation |

#### Usage
```python
# Proactive retrieval with context history
result = await service.retrieve(
    queries=[
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: {&quot;text&quot;: &quot;What are their preferences?&quot;}},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: {&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Tell me about work habits&quot;}}
    ],
    where={&quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;123&quot;},  # Optional: scope filter
    method=&quot;rag&quot;  # or &quot;llm&quot; for deeper reasoning
)

# Returns context-aware results:
{
    &quot;categories&quot;: [...],     # Relevant topic areas (auto-prioritized)
    &quot;items&quot;: [...],          # Specific memory facts
    &quot;resources&quot;: [...],      # Original sources for traceability
    &quot;next_step_query&quot;: &quot;...&quot; # Predicted follow-up context
}
```

**Proactive Filtering**: Use `where` to scope continuous monitoring:
- `where={&quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;123&quot;}` - User-specific context
- `where={&quot;agent_id__in&quot;: [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;]}` - Multi-agent coordination
- Omit `where` for global context awareness

不仅仅体现在报告质量上，相比同类产品，我们拥有🚀六大优势：

1. **AI驱动的全域监控**：AI爬虫集群7x24小时不间断作业，全面覆盖微博、小红书、抖音、快手等10+国内外关键社媒。不仅实时捕获热点内容，更能下钻至海量用户评论，让您听到最真实、最广泛的大众声音。

2. **超越LLM的复合分析引擎**：我们不仅依赖设计的5类专业Agent，更融合了微调模型、统计模型等中间件。通过多模型协同工作，确保了分析结果的深度、准度与多维视角。

3. **强大的多模态能力**：突破图文限制，能深度解析抖音、快手等短视频内容，并精准提取现代搜索引擎中的天气、日历、股票等结构化多模态信息卡片，让您全面掌握舆情动态。

4. **Agent“论坛”协作机制**：为不同Agent赋予独特的工具集与思维模式，引入辩论主持人模型，通过“论坛”机制进行链式思维碰撞与辩论。这不仅避免了单一模型的思维局限与交流导致的同质化，更催生出更高质量的集体智能与决策支持。

5. **公私域数据无缝融合**：平台不仅分析公开舆情，还提供高安全性的接口，支持您将内部业务数据库与舆情数据无缝集成。打通数据壁垒，为垂直业务提供“外部趋势+内部洞察”的强大分析能力。

6. **轻量化与高扩展性框架**：基于纯Python模块化设计，实现轻量化、一键式部署。代码结构清晰，开发者可轻松集成自定义模型与业务逻辑，实现平台的快速扩展与深度定制。

**始于舆情，而不止于舆情**。“微舆”的目标，是成为驱动一切业务场景的简洁通用的数据分析引擎。

&gt; 举个例子. 你只需简单修改Agent工具集的api参数与prompt，就可以把他变成一个金融领域的市场分析系统

## 🚀 快速开始（Docker）

### 1. 启动项目

复制一份 `.env.example` 文件，命名为 `.env` ，并按需配置 `.env` 文件中的环境变量

执行以下命令在后台启动所有服务：

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

&gt; **注：镜像拉取速度慢**，在原 `docker-compose.yml` 文件中，我们已经通过**注释**的方式提供了备用镜像地址供您替换

### 2. 配置说明

#### 数据库配置（PostgreSQL）

请按照以下参数配置数据库连接信息，也支持Mysql可自行修改：

| 配置项 | 填写值 | 说明 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DB_HOST` | `db` | 数据库服务名称 (对应 `docker-compose.yml` 中的服务名) |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | 默认 PostgreSQL 端口 |
| `DB_USER` | `bettafish` | 数据库用户名 |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `bettafish` | 数据库密码 |
| `DB_NAME` | `bettafish` | 数据库名称 |
| **其他** | **保持默认** | 数据库连接池等其他参数请保持默认设置。 |

#### 大模型配置

&gt; 我们所有 LLM 调用使用 OpenAI 的 API 接口标准

在完成数据库配置后，请正常配置**所有大模型相关的参数**，确保系统能够连接到您选择的大模型服务。

完成上述所有配置并保存后，系统即可正常运行。

## 🔧 源码启动指南

&gt; 如果你是初次学习一个Agent系统的搭建，可以从一个非常简单的demo开始：[Deep Search Agent Demo](https://github.com/666ghj/DeepSearchAgent-Demo)

### 环境要求

- **操作系统**: Windows、Linux、MacOS
- **Python版本**: 3.9+
- **Conda**: Anaconda或Miniconda
- **数据库**: PostgreSQL（推荐）或MySQL
- **内存**: 建议2GB以上

### 1. 创建环境

#### 如果使用Conda

```bash
# 创建conda环境
conda create -n your_conda_name python=3.11
conda activate your_conda_name
```

#### 如果使用uv

```bash
# 创建uv环境
uv venv --python 3.11 # 创建3.11环境
```

### 2. 安装 PDF 导出所需系统依赖（可选）

这部分有详细的配置说明：[配置所需依赖](./static/Partial%20README%20for%20PDF%20Exporting/README.md)

### 3. 安装依赖包

&gt; 如果跳过了步骤2，weasyprint库可能无法安装，PDF功能可能无法正常使用。

```bash
# 基础依赖安装
pip install -r requirements.txt

# uv版本命令（更快速安装）
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# 如果不想使用本地情感分析模型（算力需求很小，默认安装cpu版本），可以将该文件中的&quot;机器学习&quot;部分注释掉再执行指令
```

### 4. 安装Playwright浏览器驱动

```bash
# 安装浏览器驱动（用于爬虫功能）
playwright install chromium
```

### 5. 配置LLM与数据库

复制一份项目根目录 `.env.example` 文件，命名为 `.env`

编辑 `.env` 文件，填入您的API密钥（您也可以选择自己的模型、搜索代理，详情见根目录.env.example文件内或根目录config.py中的说明）：

```yml
# ====================== 数据库配置 ======================
# 数据库主机，例如localhost 或 127.0.0.1
DB_HOST=your_db_host
# 数据库端口号，默认为3306
DB_PORT=3306
# 数据库用户名
DB_USER=your_db_user
# 数据库密码
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
# 数据库名称
DB_NAME=your_db_name
# 数据库字符集，推荐utf8mb4，兼容emoji
DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
# 数据库类型postgresql或mysql
DB_DIALECT=postgresql
# 数据库不需要初始化，执行app.py时会自动检测

# ====================== LLM配置 ======================
# 您可以更改每个部分LLM使用的API，只要兼容OpenAI请求格式都可以
# 配置文件内部给了每一个Agent的推荐LLM，初次部署请先参考推荐设置

# Insight Agent
INSIGHT_ENGINE_API_KEY=
INSIGHT_ENGINE_BASE_URL=
INSIGHT_ENGINE_MODEL_NAME=

# Media Agent
...
```

### 6. 启动系统

#### 6.1 完整系统启动（推荐）

```bash
# 在项目根目录下，激活conda环境
conda activate your_conda_name

# 启动主应用即可
python app.py
```

uv 版本启动命令 
```bash
# 在项目根目录下，激活uv环境
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 启动主应用即可
python app.py
```

&gt; 注1：一次运行终止后，streamlit app可能结束异常仍然占用端口，此时搜索占用端口的进程kill掉即可

&gt; 注2：数据爬取需要单独操作，见6.3指引

访问 http://localhost:5000 即可使用完整系统

#### 6.2 单独启动某个Agent

```bash
# 启动QueryEngine
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/query_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8503

# 启动MediaEngine  
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/media_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502

# 启动InsightEngine
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/insight_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
```

#### 6.3 爬虫系统单独使用

这部分有详细的配置文档：[MindSpider使用说明](./MindSpider/README.md)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MindSpider\img\example.png&quot; alt=&quot;banner&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;

MindSpider 运行示例
&lt;/div&gt;

```bash
# 进入爬虫目录
cd MindSpider

# 项目初始化
python main.py --setup

# 运行话题提取（获取热点新闻和关键词）
python main.py --broad-topic

# 运行完整爬虫流程
python main.py --complete --date 2024-01-20

# 仅运行话题提取
python main.py --broad-topic --date 2024-01-20

# 仅运行深度爬取
python main.py --deep-sentiment --platforms xhs dy wb
```

#### 6.4 命令行报告生成工具

该工具会跳过三个分析引擎的运行阶段，直接读取它们的最新日志文件，并在无需 Web 界面的情况下生成综合报告（同时省略文件增量校验步骤），默认会在 PDF 之后自动生成 Markdown（可用参数关闭）。通常用于对报告生成结果不满意、需要快速重试的场景，或在调试 Report Engine 时启用。

```bash
# 基本使用（自动从文件名提取主题）
python report_engine_only.py

# 指定报告主题
python report_engine_only.py --query &quot;土木工程行业分析&quot;

# 跳过PDF生成（即使系统支持）
python report_engine_only.py --skip-pdf

# 跳过Markdown生成
python report_engine_only.py --skip-markdown

# 显示详细日志
python report_engine_only.py --verbose

# 按需开启 GraphRAG 并调整查询次数（未传参则遵循 .env，默认关闭）
python report_engine_only.py --graphrag-enabled true --graphrag-max-queries 3

# 查看帮助信息
python report_engine_only.py --help
```

**功能说明：**

1. **自动检查依赖**：程序会自动检查PDF生成所需的系统依赖，如果缺失会给出安装提示
2. **获取最新文件**：自动从三个引擎目录（`insight_engine_streamlit_reports`、`media_engine_streamlit_reports`、`query_engine_streamlit_reports`）获取最新的分析报告
3. **文件确认**：显示所有选择的文件名、路径和修改时间，等待用户确认（默认输入 `y` 继续，输入 `n` 退出）
4. **直接生成报告**：跳过文件增加审核程序，直接调用Report Engine生成综合报告
5. **自动保存文件**：
   - HTML报告保存到 `final_reports/` 目录
   - PDF报告（如果有依赖）保存到 `final_reports/pdf/` 目录
   - Markdown报告（可用 `--skip-markdown` 关闭）保存到 `final_reports/md/` 目录
   - 文件命名格式：`final_report_{主题}_{时间戳}.html/pdf/md`
6. **GraphRAG 可选启用**：命令行参数优先于 `.env`，若两者均未配置则保持关闭状态

**注意事项：**

- 确保三个引擎目录中至少有一个包含`.md`报告文件
- 命令行工具与Web界面相互独立，不会相互影响
- PDF生成需要安装系统依赖，详见上文&quot;安装 PDF 导出所需系统依赖&quot;部分

Learn CrewAI through our comprehensive courses:

- [Multi AI Agent Systems with CrewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) - Master the fundamentals of multi-agent systems
- [Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai/) - Deep dive into advanced implementations

### Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI offers two powerful, complementary approaches that work seamlessly together to build sophisticated AI applications:

1. **Crews**: Teams of AI agents with true autonomy and agency, working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration. Crews enable:

   - Natural, autonomous decision-making between agents
   - Dynamic task delegation and collaboration
   - Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise
   - Flexible problem-solving approaches

2. **Flows**: Production-ready, event-driven workflows that deliver precise control over complex automations. Flows provide:

   - Fine-grained control over execution paths for real-world scenarios
   - Secure, consistent state management between tasks
   - Clean integration of AI agents with production Python code
   - Conditional branching for complex business logic

The true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:

- Build complex, production-grade applications
- Balance autonomy with precise control
- Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

### Getting Started with Installation

To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Python &gt;=3.10 &lt;3.14 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, install CrewAI:

```shell
uv pip install crewai
```

If you want to install the &#039;crewai&#039; package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:

```shell
uv pip install &#039;crewai[tools]&#039;
```

The command above installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.

### Troubleshooting Dependencies

If you encounter issues during installation or usage, here are some common solutions:

#### Common Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#039;tiktoken&#039;**

   - Install tiktoken explicitly: `uv pip install &#039;crewai[embeddings]&#039;`
   - If using embedchain or other tools: `uv pip install &#039;crewai[tools]&#039;`

2. **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**

   - Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above)
   - For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
   - Try upgrading pip: `uv pip install --upgrade pip`
   - If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: `uv pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration

To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:

```shell
crewai create crew &lt;project_name&gt;
```

This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:

```
my_project/
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .env
└── src/
    └── my_project/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── main.py
        ├── crew.py
        ├── tools/
        │   ├── custom_tool.py
        │   └── __init__.py
        └── config/
            ├── agents.yaml
            └── tasks.yaml
```

You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.

#### To customize your project, you can:

- Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.
- Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.
- Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.
- Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
- Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.

#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:

Instantiate your crew:

```shell
crewai create crew latest-ai-development
```

Modify the files as needed to fit your use case:

**agents.yaml**

```yaml
# src/my_project/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: &gt;
    {topic} Senior Data Researcher
  goal: &gt;
    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
  backstory: &gt;
    You&#039;re a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: &gt;
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: &gt;
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: &gt;
    You&#039;re a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You&#039;re known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

**tasks.yaml**

````yaml
# src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:

    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:

- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
- A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd my_project
crewai install (Optional)
```

To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
crewai run
```

or

```bash
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If an error happens due to the usage of poetry, please run the following command to update your crewai package:

```bash
crewai update
```

You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the full final report.

In addition to the sequential process, you can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. [See more about the processes here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Processes/).

### Using Crews and Flows Together

CrewAI&#039;s power truly shines when combining Crews with Flows to create sophisticated automation pipelines.
CrewAI flows support logical operators like `or_` and `and_` to combine multiple conditions. This can be used with `@start`, `@listen`, or `@router` decorators to create complex triggering conditions.

- `or_`: Triggers when any of the specified conditions are met.
- `and_`Triggers when all of the specified conditions are met.

Here&#039;s how you can orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured state for precise control
class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = &quot;neutral&quot;
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state
        self.state.sentiment = &quot;analyzing&quot;
        return {&quot;sector&quot;: &quot;tech&quot;, &quot;timeframe&quot;: &quot;1W&quot;}  # These parameters match the task description template

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        # Show crew agency through specialized roles
        analyst = Agent(
            role=&quot;Senior Market Analyst&quot;,
            goal=&quot;Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight&quot;,
            backstory=&quot;You&#039;re a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns&quot;
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role=&quot;Data Researcher&quot;,
            goal=&quot;Gather and validate supporting market data&quot;,
            backstory=&quot;You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources&quot;
        )

        analysis_task = Task(
            description=&quot;Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}&quot;,
            expected_output=&quot;Detailed market analysis with confidence score&quot;,

## 📖 About This Course

This is a **learner-focused project** where you&#039;ll build a complete research assistant system that automatically fetches academic papers, understands their content, and answers your research questions using advanced RAG techniques.

**The arXiv Paper Curator** will teach you to build a **production-grade RAG system using industry best practices**. Unlike tutorials that jump straight to vector search, we follow the **professional path**: master keyword search foundations first, then enhance with vectors for hybrid retrieval.

&gt; **🎯 The Professional Difference:** We build RAG systems the way successful companies do - solid search foundations enhanced with AI, not AI-first approaches that ignore search fundamentals.

By the end of this course, you&#039;ll have your own AI research assistant and the deep technical skills to build production RAG systems for any domain.

### **🎓 What You&#039;ll Build**

- **Week 1:** Complete infrastructure with Docker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, and Airflow
- **Week 2:** Automated data pipeline fetching and parsing academic papers from arXiv  
- **Week 3:** Production BM25 keyword search with filtering and relevance scoring
- **Week 4:** Intelligent chunking + hybrid search combining keywords with semantic understanding
- **Week 5:** Complete RAG pipeline with local LLM, streaming responses, and Gradio interface
- **Week 6:** Production monitoring with Langfuse tracing and Redis caching for optimized performance
- **Week 7:** **Agentic RAG with LangGraph and Telegram Bot for mobile access**

## Build Real-Time Vision AI Agents

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9778ab9-938d-4101-8605-ff879c29b0e4

### Multi-modal AI agents that watch, listen, and understand video.

Vision Agents give you the building blocks to create intelligent, low-latency video experiences powered by your models,
your infrastructure, and your use cases.

### Key Highlights

- **Video AI:** Built for real-time video AI. Combine YOLO, Roboflow, and others with Gemini/OpenAI in real-time.
- **Low Latency:** Join quickly (500ms) and maintain audio/video latency under 30ms
  using [Stream&#039;s edge network](https://getstream.io/video/).
- **Open:** Built by Stream, but works with any video edge network.
- **Native APIs:** Native SDK methods from OpenAI (`create response`), Gemini (`generate`), and Claude (
  `create message`) — always access the latest LLM capabilities.
- **SDKs:** SDKs for React, Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, and Unity, powered by Stream&#039;s ultra-low-latency
  network.

## See It In Action

### Sports Coaching

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1258ac2-ca98-4019-80e4-41ec5530117e

This example shows you how to build golf coaching AI with YOLO and Gemini Live.
Combining a fast object detection model (like YOLO) with a full realtime AI is useful for many different video AI use
cases.
For example: Drone fire detection, sports/video game coaching, physical therapy, workout coaching, just dance style
games etc.

```python
# partial example, full example: examples/02_golf_coach_example/golf_coach_example.py
agent = Agent(
    edge=getstream.Edge(),
    agent_user=agent_user,
    instructions=&quot;Read @golf_coach.md&quot;,
    llm=gemini.Realtime(fps=10),
    # llm=openai.Realtime(fps=1), # Careful with FPS can get expensive
    processors=[ultralytics.YOLOPoseProcessor(model_path=&quot;yolo11n-pose.pt&quot;, device=&quot;cuda&quot;)],
)
```

### Security Camera with Package Theft Detection

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a2cdd8-909c-46d8-aab7-039a90efc186

This example shows a security camera system that detects faces, tracks packages and detects when a package is stolen. It
automatically generates &quot;WANTED&quot; posters, posting them to X in real-time.

It combines face recognition, YOLOv11 object detection, Nano Banana and Gemini for a complete security workflow with
voice interaction.

```python
# partial example, full example: examples/04_security_camera_example/security_camera_example.py
security_processor = SecurityCameraProcessor(
    fps=5,
    model_path=&quot;weights_custom.pt&quot;,  # YOLOv11 for package detection
    package_conf_threshold=0.7,
)

agent = Agent(
    edge=getstream.Edge(),
    agent_user=User(name=&quot;Security AI&quot;, id=&quot;agent&quot;),
    instructions=&quot;Read @instructions.md&quot;,
    processors=[security_processor],
    llm=gemini.LLM(&quot;gemini-2.5-flash-lite&quot;),
    tts=elevenlabs.TTS(),
    stt=deepgram.STT(),
)
```

### Cluely style Invisible Assistant (coming soon)

Apps like Cluely offer realtime coaching via an invisible overlay. This example shows you how you can build your own
invisible assistant.
It combines Gemini realtime (to watch your screen and audio), and doesn&#039;t broadcast audio (only text). This approach
is quite versatile and can be used for: Sales coaching, job interview cheating, physical world/ on the job coaching with
glasses

Demo video

```python
agent = Agent(
    edge=StreamEdge(),  # low latency edge. clients for React, iOS, Android, RN, Flutter etc.
    agent_user=agent_user,  # the user object for the agent (name, image etc)
    instructions=&quot;You are silently helping the user pass this interview. See @interview_coach.md&quot;,
    # gemini realtime, no need to set tts, or sst (though that&#039;s also supported)
    llm=gemini.Realtime()
)
```

## Processors

Processors let your agent **manage state** and **handle audio/video** in real-time.

They take care of the hard stuff, like:

- Running smaller models
- Making API calls
- Transforming media

… so you can focus on your agent logic.

# Skills
Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that&#039;s creating documents with your company&#039;s brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization&#039;s specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

# About This Repository

This repository contains skills that demonstrate what&#039;s possible with Claude&#039;s skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We&#039;ve also included the document creation &amp; editing skills that power [Claude&#039;s document capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) under the hood in the [`skills/docx`](./skills/docx), [`skills/pdf`](./skills/pdf), [`skills/pptx`](./skills/pptx), and [`skills/xlsx`](./skills/xlsx) subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

## Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

- [./template](./template): Skill template

# Try in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API

## Claude Code
You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
```

Then, to install a specific set of skills:
1. Select `Browse and install plugins`
2. Select `anthropic-agent-skills`
3. Select `document-skills` or `example-skills`
4. Select `Install now`

Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via:
```
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the `document-skills` plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: &quot;Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from `path/to/some-file.pdf`&quot;

## Claude.ai

These example skills are all already available to paid plans in Claude.ai. 

To use any skill from this repository or upload custom skills, follow the instructions in [Using skills in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude#h_a4222fa77b).

## Claude API

You can use Anthropic&#039;s pre-built skills, and upload custom skills, via the Claude API. See the [Skills API Quickstart](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide#creating-a-skill) for more.

# Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow. For more details, see [How to create custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).

# Partner Skills

Skills are a great way to teach Claude how to get better at using specific pieces of software. As we see awesome example skills from partners, we may highlight some of them here:

Each plugin is completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills:

- **Install only what you need** - Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills
- **Minimal token usage** - No unnecessary resources loaded into context
- **Mix and match** - Compose multiple plugins for complex workflows
- **Clear boundaries** - Each plugin has a single, focused purpose
- **Progressive disclosure** - Skills load knowledge only when activated

**Example**: Installing `python-development` loads 3 Python agents, 1 scaffolding tool, and makes 16 skills available (~1000 tokens), not the entire marketplace.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
```

This makes all 72 plugins available for installation, but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.

### Step 2: Install Plugins

Browse available plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

Install the plugins you need:

```bash
# Essential development plugins
/plugin install python-development          # Python with 16 specialized skills
/plugin install javascript-typescript       # JS/TS with 4 specialized skills
/plugin install backend-development         # Backend APIs with 3 architecture skills

# Infrastructure &amp; operations
/plugin install kubernetes-operations       # K8s with 4 deployment skills
/plugin install cloud-infrastructure        # AWS/Azure/GCP with 4 cloud skills

# Security &amp; quality
/plugin install security-scanning           # SAST with security skill
/plugin install comprehensive-review       # Multi-perspective code analysis

# Full-stack orchestration
/plugin install full-stack-orchestration   # Multi-agent workflows
```

Each installed plugin loads **only its specific agents, commands, and skills** into Claude&#039;s context.

### Plugins vs Agents

You install **plugins**, which bundle agents:

| Plugin                  | Agents                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `comprehensive-review`  | architect-review, code-reviewer, security-auditor |
| `javascript-typescript` | javascript-pro, typescript-pro                    |
| `python-development`    | python-pro, django-pro, fastapi-pro               |
| `blockchain-web3`       | blockchain-developer                              |

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - can&#039;t install agents directly
/plugin install typescript-pro

# ✅ Right - install the plugin
/plugin install javascript-typescript@claude-code-workflows
```

### Troubleshooting

**&quot;Plugin not found&quot;** → Use plugin names, not agent names. Add `@claude-code-workflows` suffix.

**Plugins not loading** → Clear cache and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-code-workflows &amp;&amp; rm ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
```

### Three-Tier Model Strategy

Strategic model assignment for optimal performance and cost:

| Tier       | Model    | Agents | Use Case                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | Opus 4.6 | 42     | Critical architecture, security, ALL code review, production coding (language pros, frameworks) |
| **Tier 2** | Inherit  | 42     | Complex tasks - user chooses model (AI/ML, backend, frontend/mobile, specialized)               |
| **Tier 3** | Sonnet   | 51     | Support with intelligence (docs, testing, debugging, network, API docs, DX, legacy, payments)   |
| **Tier 4** | Haiku    | 18     | Fast operational tasks (SEO, deployment, simple docs, sales, content, search)                   |

**Why Opus 4.6 for Critical Agents?**

- 80.8% on SWE-bench (industry-leading)
- 65% fewer tokens for complex tasks
- Best for architecture decisions and security audits

**Tier 2 Flexibility (`inherit`):**
Agents marked `inherit` use your session&#039;s default model, letting you balance cost and capability:

- Set via `claude --model opus` or `claude --model sonnet` when starting a session
- Falls back to Sonnet 4.6 if no default specified
- Perfect for frontend/mobile developers who want cost control
- AI/ML engineers can choose Opus for complex model work

**Cost Considerations:**

- **Opus 4.6**: $5/$25 per million input/output tokens - Premium for critical work
- **Sonnet 4.6**: $3/$15 per million tokens - Balanced performance/cost
- **Haiku 4.5**: $1/$5 per million tokens - Fast, cost-effective operations
- Opus&#039;s 65% token reduction on complex tasks often offsets higher rate
- Use `inherit` tier to control costs for high-volume use cases

Orchestration patterns combine models for efficiency:

```
Opus (architecture) → Sonnet (development) → Haiku (deployment)
```

  - Extensive 3rd-party integrations for easy observability: Seamlessly integrate with a growing list of frameworks, supporting many of the largest and most popular ones natively (including recent additions like **Google ADK**, **Autogen**, and **Flowise AI**). ([Integrations](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/integrations/overview/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=integrations_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik))
  - Annotate traces and spans with feedback scores via the [Python SDK](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/annotate_traces/#annotating-traces-and-spans-using-the-sdk?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=sdk_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik) or the [UI](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/annotate_traces/#annotating-traces-through-the-ui?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=ui_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).
  - Experiment with prompts and models in the [Prompt Playground](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/playground).

- **Evaluation &amp; Testing**:
  - Automate your LLM application evaluation with [Datasets](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/manage_datasets/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=datasets_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik) and [Experiments](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/evaluate_your_llm/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=eval_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).
  - Leverage powerful LLM-as-a-judge metrics for complex tasks like [hallucination detection](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/hallucination/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=hallucination_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik), [moderation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/moderation/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=moderation_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik), and RAG assessment ([Answer Relevance](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/answer_relevance/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=alex_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik), [Context Precision](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/context_precision/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=context_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik)).
  - Integrate evaluations into your CI/CD pipeline with our [PyTest integration](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/testing/pytest_integration/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=pytest_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).

- **Production Monitoring &amp; Optimization**:
  - Log high volumes of production traces: Opik is designed for scale (40M+ traces/day).
  - Monitor feedback scores, trace counts, and token usage over time in the [Opik Dashboard](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/production/production_monitoring/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=dashboard_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).
  - Utilize [Online Evaluation Rules](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/production/rules/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=dashboard_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik) with LLM-as-a-Judge metrics to identify production issues.
  - Leverage **Opik Agent Optimizer** and **Opik Guardrails** to continuously improve and secure your LLM applications in production.

&lt;a id=&quot;%EF%B8%8F-opik-server-installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## 🛠️ Opik Server Installation

Get your Opik server running in minutes. Choose the option that best suits your needs:

### Option 1: Comet.com Cloud (Easiest &amp; Recommended)

Access Opik instantly without any setup. Ideal for quick starts and hassle-free maintenance.

👉 [Create your free Comet account](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=install_create_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik)

### Option 2: Self-Host Opik for Full Control

Deploy Opik in your own environment. Choose between Docker for local setups or Kubernetes for scalability.

#### Self-Hosting with Docker Compose (for Local Development &amp; Testing)

This is the simplest way to get a local Opik instance running. Note the new `./opik.sh` installation script:

On Linux or Mac Environment:

```bash
# Clone the Opik repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/opik.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd opik

# Start the Opik platform
./opik.sh
```

On Windows Environment:

```powershell
# Clone the Opik repository
git clone https://github.com/comet-ml/opik.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd opik

# Start the Opik platform
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;.\\opik.ps1&quot;
```

**Service Profiles for Development**

The Opik installation scripts now support service profiles for different development scenarios:

```bash
# Start full Opik suite (default behavior)
./opik.sh

# Start only infrastructure services (databases, caches etc.)
./opik.sh --infra

# Start infrastructure + backend services
./opik.sh --backend

# Enable guardrails with any profile
./opik.sh --guardrails # Guardrails with full Opik suite
./opik.sh --backend --guardrails # Guardrails with infrastructure + backend
```

Use the `--help` or `--info` options to troubleshoot issues. Dockerfiles now ensure containers run as non-root users for enhanced security. Once all is up and running, you can now visit [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) on your browser! For detailed instructions, see the [Local Deployment Guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/local_deployment?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=self_host_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).

#### Self-Hosting with Kubernetes &amp; Helm (for Scalable Deployments)

For production or larger-scale self-hosted deployments, Opik can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster using our Helm chart. Click the badge for the full [Kubernetes Installation Guide using Helm](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/kubernetes/#kubernetes-installation?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=kubernetes_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).

&lt;a id=&quot;-opik-client-sdk&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
## 💻 Opik Client SDK

Opik provides a suite of client libraries and a REST API to interact with the Opik server. This includes SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and Ruby (via OpenTelemetry), allowing for seamless integration into your workflows. For detailed API and SDK references, see the [Opik Client Reference Documentation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/reference/overview?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=reference_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik).

### Python SDK Quick Start

To get started with the Python SDK:

Install the package:

```bash
# install using pip
pip install opik

# or install with uv
uv pip install opik
```

Configure the python SDK by running the `opik configure` command, which will prompt you for your Opik server address (for self-hosted instances) or your API key and workspace (for Comet.com):

```bash
opik configure
```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; You can also call `opik.configure(use_local=True)` from your Python code to configure the SDK to run on a local self-hosted installation, or provide API key and workspace details directly for Comet.com. Refer to the [Python SDK documentation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=python_sdk_docs_link&amp;utm_campaign=opik) for more configuration options.

You are now ready to start logging traces using the [Python SDK](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/?from=llm&amp;utm_source=opik&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_content=sdk_link2&amp;utm_campaign=opik).

&lt;a id=&quot;-logging-traces-with-integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### 📝 Logging Traces with Integrations

The easiest way to log traces is to use one of our direct integrations. Opik supports a wide array of frameworks, including recent additions like **Google ADK**, **Autogen**, **AG2**, and **Flowise AI**:

## Release Process

ComfyUI follows a weekly release cycle targeting Monday but this regularly changes because of model releases or large changes to the codebase. There are three interconnected repositories:

1. **[ComfyUI Core](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**
   - Releases a new stable version (e.g., v0.7.0) roughly every week.
   - Starting from v0.4.0 patch versions will be used for fixes backported onto the current stable release.
   - Minor versions will be used for releases off the master branch.
   - Patch versions may still be used for releases on the master branch in cases where a backport would not make sense.
   - Commits outside of the stable release tags may be very unstable and break many custom nodes.
   - Serves as the foundation for the desktop release

2. **[ComfyUI Desktop](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop)**
   - Builds a new release using the latest stable core version

3. **[ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend)**
   - Weekly frontend updates are merged into the core repository
   - Features are frozen for the upcoming core release
   - Development continues for the next release cycle

# Installing

## Windows Portable

There is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).

### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)

Simply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) or with the windows explorer on recent windows versions and run. For smaller models you normally only need to put the checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints but many of the larger models have multiple files. Make sure to follow the instructions to know which subfolder to put them in ComfyUI\models\

If you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -&gt; properties -&gt; unblock

The portable above currently comes with python 3.13 and pytorch cuda 13.0. Update your Nvidia drivers if it doesn&#039;t start.

#### Alternative Downloads:

[Experimental portable for AMD GPUs](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_amd.7z)

[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.6 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu126.7z) (Supports Nvidia 10 series and older GPUs).

#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?

See the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.


## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)

You can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:
```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy install
```

## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)

Python 3.14 works but some custom nodes may have issues. The free threaded variant works but some dependencies will enable the GIL so it&#039;s not fully supported.

Python 3.13 is very well supported. If you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13 you can try 3.12

torch 2.4 and above is supported but some features and optimizations might only work on newer versions. We generally recommend using the latest major version of pytorch with the latest cuda version unless it is less than 2 weeks old.

### Instructions:

Git clone this repo.

Put your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints

Put your VAE in: models/vae


### AMD GPUs (Linux)

AMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don&#039;t have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm7.1```

This is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 7.2 which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.2```


### AMD GPUs (Experimental: Windows and Linux), RDNA 3, 3.5 and 4 only.

These have less hardware support than the builds above but they work on windows. You also need to install the pytorch version specific to your hardware.

RDNA 3 (RX 7000 series):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx110X-all/```

RDNA 3.5 (Strix halo/Ryzen AI Max+ 365):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/```

RDNA 4 (RX 9000 series):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx120X-all/```

### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)

Intel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip. More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)

1. To install PyTorch xpu, use the following command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu```

This is the command to install the Pytorch xpu nightly which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```

### NVIDIA

Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130```

This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the &quot;Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled&quot; error, uninstall torch with:

```pip uninstall torch```

And install it again with the command above.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.

### Others:

#### Apple Mac silicon

You can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.

1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).
1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.
1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).
1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

&gt; **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).
