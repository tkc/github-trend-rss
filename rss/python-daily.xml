### **Demo**

&gt; *Can you search for the agenticSeek project, learn what skills are required, then open the CV_candidates.zip and then tell me which match best the project*

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ca60e9-7b3b-4533-840e-08f9ac426316

Disclaimer: This demo, including all the files that appear (e.g: CV_candidates.zip), are entirely fictional. We are not a corporation, we seek open-source contributors not candidates.

&gt; 🛠⚠️️ **Active Work in Progress** – Please note that Code/Bash is not dockerized yet but will be soon (see docker_deployement branch) - Do not deploy over network or production.

&gt; 🙏 This project started as a side-project with zero roadmap and zero funding. It&#039;s grown way beyond what I expected by ending in GitHub Trending. Contributions, feedback, and patience are deeply appreciated.

## Setup for running LLM locally on your machine

**Hardware Requirements:**

To run LLMs locally, you&#039;ll need sufficient hardware. At a minimum, a GPU capable of running Qwen/Deepseek 14B is required. See the FAQ for detailed model/performance recommendations.

**Setup your local provider**  

Start your local provider, for example with ollama:

```sh
ollama serve
```

See below for a list of local supported provider.

**Update the config.ini**

Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to a supported provider and provider_model to a LLM supported by your provider. We recommand reasoning model such as *Qwen* or *Deepseek*.

See the **FAQ** at the end of the README for required hardware.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = True # Whenever you are running locally or with remote provider.
provider_name = ollama # or lm-studio, openai, etc..
provider_model = deepseek-r1:14b # choose a model that fit your hardware
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
agent_name = Jarvis # name of your AI
recover_last_session = True # whenever to recover the previous session
save_session = True # whenever to remember the current session
speak = True # text to speech
listen = False # Speech to text, only for CLI
work_dir =  /Users/mlg/Documents/workspace # The workspace for AgenticSeek.
jarvis_personality = False # Whenever to use a more &quot;Jarvis&quot; like personality (experimental)
languages = en zh # The list of languages, Text to speech will default to the first language on the list
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = True # Whenever to use headless browser, recommanded only if you use web interface.
stealth_mode = True # Use undetected selenium to reduce browser detection
```

Warning: Do *NOT* set provider_name to `openai` if using LM-studio for running LLMs. Set it to `lm-studio`.

Note: Some provider (eg: lm-studio) require you to have `http://` in front of the IP. For example `http://127.0.0.1:1234`

**List of local providers**

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (set `provider_name` to `lm-studio`)|
| openai    | Yes     |  Use openai compatible API (eg: llama.cpp server)  |

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Run with an API** section if your hardware can&#039;t run deepseek locally*

*See the **Config** section for detailled config file explanation.*

---

## Setup to run with an API

Set the desired provider in the `config.ini`. See below for a list of API providers.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = google
provider_model = gemini-2.0-flash
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000 # doesn&#039;t matter
```
Warning: Make sure there is not trailing space in the config.

Export your API key: `export &lt;&lt;PROVIDER&gt;&gt;_API_KEY=&quot;xxx&quot;`

Example: export `TOGETHER_API_KEY=&quot;xxxxx&quot;`

**List of API providers**
  
| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| openai    | Depends  | Use ChatGPT API  |
| deepseek  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                            |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |
| togetherAI | No    | Use together AI API (non-private)                         |
| google | No    | Use google gemini API (non-private)                         |

*We advice against using gpt-4o or other closedAI models*, performance are poor for web browsing and task planning.

Please also note that coding/bash might fail with gemini, it seem to ignore our prompt for format to respect, which are optimized for deepseek r1.

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Config** section for detailled config file explanation.*

---

## Start services and Run

Activate your python env if needed.
```sh
source agentic_seek_env/bin/activate
```

Start required services. This will start all services from the docker-compose.yml, including:
    - searxng
    - redis (required by searxng)
    - frontend

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh # MacOS
start ./start_services.cmd # Window
```

**Options 1:** Run with the CLI interface.

```sh
python3 cli.py
```

We advice you set `headless_browser` to False in the config.ini for CLI mode.

**Options 2:** Run with the Web interface.

Start the backend.

```sh
python3 api.py
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the web interface.

---

## Usage

Make sure the services are up and running with `./start_services.sh` and run the AgenticSeek with `python3 cli.py` for CLI mode or `python3 api.py` then go to `localhost:3000` for web interface.

You can also use speech to text by setting `listen = True` in the config. Only for CLI mode.

To exit, simply say/type `goodbye`.

Here are some example usage:

&gt; *Make a snake game in python!*

&gt; *Search the web for top cafes in Rennes, France, and save a list of three with their addresses in rennes_cafes.txt.*

&gt; *Write a Go program to calculate the factorial of a number, save it as factorial.go in your workspace*

&gt; *Search my summer_pictures folder for all JPG files, rename them with today’s date, and save a list of renamed files in photos_list.txt*

&gt; *Search online for popular sci-fi movies from 2024 and pick three to watch tonight. Save the list in movie_night.txt.*

&gt; *Search the web for the latest AI news articles from 2025, select three, and write a Python script to scrape their titles and summaries. Save the script as news_scraper.py and the summaries in ai_news.txt in /home/projects*

&gt; *Friday, search the web for a free stock price API, register with supersuper7434567@gmail.com then write a Python script to fetch using the API daily prices for Tesla, and save the results in stock_prices.csv*

*Note that form filling capabilities are still experimental and might fail.*



After you type your query, AgenticSeek will allocate the best agent for the task.

Because this is an early prototype, the agent routing system might not always allocate the right agent based on your query.

Therefore, you should be very explicit in what you want and how the AI might proceed for example if you want it to conduct a web search, do not say:

`Do you know some good countries for solo-travel?`

Instead, ask:

`Do a web search and find out which are the best country for solo-travel`

---

## **Setup to run the LLM on your own server**  

If you have a powerful computer or a server that you can use, but you want to use it from your laptop you have the options to run the LLM on a remote server using our custom llm server. 

On your &quot;server&quot; that will run the AI model, get the ip address

```sh
ip a | grep &quot;inet &quot; | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1 # local ip
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip # public ip
```

Note: For Windows or macOS, use ipconfig or ifconfig respectively to find the IP address.

Clone the repository and enter the `server/`folder.


```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek/llm_server/
```

Install server specific requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server script.

```sh
python3 app.py --provider ollama --port 3333
```

You have the choice between using `ollama` and `llamacpp` as a LLM service.


Now on your personal computer:

Change the `config.ini` file to set the `provider_name` to `server` and `provider_model` to `deepseek-r1:xxb`.
Set the `provider_server_address` to the ip address of the machine that will run the model.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = server
provider_model = deepseek-r1:70b
provider_server_address = x.x.x.x:3333
```


Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

---

## Speech to Text

Please note that currently speech to text only work in english.

The speech-to-text functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, set the listen option to True in the config.ini file:

```
listen = True
```

When enabled, the speech-to-text feature listens for a trigger keyword, which is the agent&#039;s name, before it begins processing your input. You can customize the agent&#039;s name by updating the `agent_name` value in the *config.ini* file:

```
agent_name = Friday
```

For optimal recognition, we recommend using a common English name like &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Emma&quot; as the agent name

Once you see the transcript start to appear, say the agent&#039;s name aloud to wake it up (e.g., &quot;Friday&quot;).

Speak your query clearly.

End your request with a confirmation phrase to signal the system to proceed. Examples of confirmation phrases include:
```
&quot;do it&quot;, &quot;go ahead&quot;, &quot;execute&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;thanks&quot;, &quot;would ya&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, &quot;okay?&quot;, &quot;proceed&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, &quot;go on&quot;, &quot;do that&quot;, &quot;go it&quot;, &quot;do you understand?&quot;
```

## Config

Example config:
```
[MAIN]
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
agent_name = Friday
recover_last_session = False
save_session = False
speak = False
listen = False
work_dir =  /Users/mlg/Documents/ai_folder
jarvis_personality = False
languages = en zh
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = False
stealth_mode = False
```

**Explanation**:

- is_local -&gt; Runs the agent locally (True) or on a remote server (False).

- provider_name -&gt; The provider to use (one of: `ollama`, `server`, `lm-studio`, `deepseek-api`)

- provider_model -&gt; The model used, e.g., deepseek-r1:32b.

- provider_server_address -&gt; Server address, e.g., 127.0.0.1:11434 for local. Set to anything for non-local API.

- agent_name -&gt; Name of the agent, e.g., Friday. Used as a trigger word for TTS.

- recover_last_session -&gt; Restarts from last session (True) or not (False).

- save_session -&gt; Saves session data (True) or not (False).

- speak -&gt; Enables voice output (True) or not (False).

- listen -&gt; listen to voice input (True) or not (False).

- work_dir -&gt; Folder the AI will have access to. eg: /Users/user/Documents/.

- jarvis_personality -&gt; Uses a JARVIS-like personality (True) or not (False). This simply change the prompt file.

- languages -&gt; The list of supported language, needed for the llm router to work properly, avoid putting too many or too similar languages.

- headless_browser -&gt; Runs browser without a visible window (True) or not (False).

- stealth_mode -&gt; Make bot detector time harder. Only downside is you have to manually install the anticaptcha extension.

- languages -&gt; List of supported languages. Required for agent routing system. The longer the languages list the more model will be downloaded.

## Providers

The table below show the available providers:

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| server    | Yes    | Host the model on another machine, run your local machine |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (`lm-studio`)             |
| openai    | Depends  | Use ChatGPT API (non-private) or openai compatible API  |
| deepseek-api  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                            |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |
| togetherAI | No    | Use together AI API (non-private)                         |
| google | No    | Use google gemini API (non-private)                         |

To select a provider change the config.ini:

```
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000
```
`is_local`: should be True for any locally running LLM, otherwise False.

`provider_name`: Select the provider to use by it&#039;s name, see the provider list above.

`provider_model`: Set the model to use by the agent.

`provider_server_address`: can be set to anything if you are not using the server provider.

# Known issues

## Chromedriver Issues

**Known error #1:** *chromedriver mismatch*

`Exception: Failed to initialize browser: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 113
Current browser version is 134.0.6998.89 with binary path`

This happen if there is a mismatch between your browser and chromedriver version.

You need to navigate to download the latest version:

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

If you&#039;re using Chrome version 115 or newer go to:

https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

And download the chromedriver version matching your OS.

![alt text](./media/chromedriver_readme.png)

If this section is incomplete please raise an issue.

##  connection adapters Issues

```
Exception: Provider lm-studio failed: HTTP request failed: No connection adapters were found for &#039;127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions&#039;
```

Make sure you have `http://` in front of the provider IP address :

`provider_server_address = http://127.0.0.1:11434`

## SearxNG base URL must be provided

```
raise ValueError(&quot;SearxNG base URL must be provided either as an argument or via the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable.&quot;)
ValueError: SearxNG base URL must be provided either as an argument or via the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable.
```

Maybe you didn&#039;t move `.env.example` as `.env` ? You can also export SEARXNG_BASE_URL:

`export  SEARXNG_BASE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8080&quot;`

## FAQ

**Q: What hardware do I need?**  

| Model Size  | GPU  | Comment                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 7B        | 8GB Vram | ⚠️ Not recommended. Performance is poor, frequent hallucinations, and planner agents will likely fail. |
| 14B        | 12 GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 3060) | ✅ Usable for simple tasks. May struggle with web browsing and planning tasks. |
| 32B        | 24+ GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 4090) | 🚀 Success with most tasks, might still struggle with task planning |
| 70B+        | 48+ GB Vram (eg. mac studio) | 💪 Excellent. Recommended for advanced use cases. |

**Q: Why Deepseek R1 over other models?**  

Deepseek R1 excels at reasoning and tool use for its size. We think it’s a solid fit for our needs other models work fine, but Deepseek is our primary pick.

**Q: I get an error running `cli.py`. What do I do?**  

Ensure local is running (`ollama serve`), your `config.ini` matches your provider, and dependencies are installed. If none work feel free to raise an issue.

**Q: Can it really run 100% locally?**  

Yes with Ollama, lm-studio or server providers, all speech to text, LLM

```
- 项目管理脚本，详细使用指导：[项目管理脚本](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/wiki/%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC)
## 一、准备

### 1. 账号注册

项目默认使用OpenAI接口，需前往 [OpenAI注册页面](https://beta.openai.com/signup) 创建账号，创建完账号则前往 [API管理页面](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) 创建一个 API Key 并保存下来，后面需要在项目中配置这个key。接口需要海外网络访问及绑定信用卡支付。

&gt; 默认对话模型是 openai 的 gpt-3.5-turbo，计费方式是约每 1000tokens (约750个英文单词 或 500汉字，包含请求和回复) 消耗 $0.002，图片生成是Dell E模型，每张消耗 $0.016。

项目同时也支持使用 LinkAI 接口，无需代理，可使用 Kimi、文心、讯飞、GPT-3.5、GPT-4o 等模型，支持 定制化知识库、联网搜索、MJ绘图、文档总结、工作流等能力。修改配置即可一键使用，参考 [接入文档](https://link-ai.tech/platform/link-app/wechat)。

### 2.运行环境

支持 Linux、MacOS、Windows 系统（可在Linux服务器上长期运行)，同时需安装 `Python`。
&gt; 建议Python版本在 3.7.1~3.9.X 之间，推荐3.8版本，3.10及以上版本在 MacOS 可用，其他系统上不确定能否正常运行。

&gt; 注意：Docker 或 Railway 部署无需安装python环境和下载源码，可直接快进到下一节。

**(1) 克隆项目代码：**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat
cd chatgpt-on-wechat/
```

注: 如遇到网络问题可选择国内镜像 https://gitee.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat

**(2) 安装核心依赖 (必选)：**
&gt; 能够使用`itchat`创建机器人，并具有文字交流功能所需的最小依赖集合。
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**(3) 拓展依赖 (可选，建议安装)：**

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-optional.txt
```
&gt; 如果某项依赖安装失败可注释掉对应的行再继续

## 二、配置

配置文件的模板在根目录的`config-template.json`中，需复制该模板创建最终生效的 `config.json` 文件：

```bash
  cp config-template.json config.json
```

然后在`config.json`中填入配置，以下是对默认配置的说明，可根据需要进行自定义修改（注意实际使用时请去掉注释，保证JSON格式的完整）：

```bash
# config.json文件内容示例
{
  &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;,                                     # 模型名称, 支持 gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o, wenxin, xunfei, glm-4, claude-3-7-sonnet-latest, moonshot等

}
```
**配置说明：**

**1.个人聊天**

+ 个人聊天中，需要以 &quot;bot&quot;或&quot;@bot&quot; 为开头的内容触发机器人，对应配置项 `single_chat_prefix` (如果不需要以前缀触发可以填写  `&quot;single_chat_prefix&quot;: [&quot;&quot;]`)
+ 机器人回复的内容会以 &quot;[bot] &quot; 作为前缀， 以区分真人，对应的配置项为 `single_chat_reply_prefix` (如果不需要前缀可以填写 `&quot;single_chat_reply_prefix&quot;: &quot;&quot;`)

**2.群组聊天**

+ 群组聊天中，群名称需配置在 `group_name_white_list ` 中才能开启群聊自动回复。如果想对所有群聊生效，可以直接填写 `&quot;group_name_white_list&quot;: [&quot;ALL_GROUP&quot;]`
+ 默认只要被人 @ 就会触发机器人自动回复；另外群聊天中只要检测到以 &quot;@bot&quot; 开头的内容，同样会自动回复（方便自己触发），这对应配置项 `group_chat_prefix`
+ 可选配置: `group_name_keyword_white_list`配置项支持模糊匹配群名称，`group_chat_keyword`配置项则支持模糊匹配群消息内容，用法与上述两个配置项相同。（Contributed by [evolay](https://github.com/evolay))
+ `group_chat_in_one_session`：使群聊共享一个会话上下文，配置 `[&quot;ALL_GROUP&quot;]` 则作用于所有群聊

**3.语音识别**

+ 添加 `&quot;speech_recognition&quot;: true` 将开启语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，该参数仅支持私聊 (注意由于语音消息无法匹配前缀，一旦开启将对所有语音自动回复，支持语音触发画图)；
+ 添加 `&quot;group_speech_recognition&quot;: true` 将开启群组语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，参数仅支持群聊 (会匹配group_chat_prefix和group_chat_keyword, 支持语音触发画图)；
+ 添加 `&quot;voice_reply_voice&quot;: true` 将开启语音回复语音（同时作用于私聊和群聊）

**4.其他配置**

+ `model`: 模型名称，目前支持 `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `wenxin` , `claude` , `gemini`, `glm-4`,  `xunfei`, `moonshot`等，全部模型名称参考[common/const.py](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/common/const.py)文件
+ `temperature`,`frequency_penalty`,`presence_penalty`: Chat API接口参数，详情参考[OpenAI官方文档。](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)
+ `proxy`：由于目前 `openai` 接口国内无法访问，需配置代理客户端的地址，详情参考  [#351](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/351)
+ 对于图像生成，在满足个人或群组触发条件外，还需要额外的关键词前缀来触发，对应配置 `image_create_prefix `
+ 关于OpenAI对话及图片接口的参数配置（内容自由度、回复字数限制、图片大小等），可以参考 [对话接口](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) 和 [图像接口](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)  文档，在[`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py)中检查哪些参数在本项目中是可配置的。
+ `conversation_max_tokens`：表示能够记忆的上下文最大字数（一问一答为一组对话，如果累积的对话字数超出限制，就会优先移除最早的一组对话）
+ `rate_limit_chatgpt`，`rate_limit_dalle`：每分钟最高问答速率、画图速率，超速后排队按序处理。
+ `clear_memory_commands`: 对话内指令，主动清空前文记忆，字符串数组可自定义指令别名。
+ `hot_reload`: 程序退出后，暂存等于状态，默认关闭。
+ `character_desc` 配置中保存着你对机器人说的一段话，他会记住这段话并作为他的设定，你可以为他定制任何人格      (关于会话上下文的更多内容参考该 [issue](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/43))
+ `subscribe_msg`：订阅消息，公众号和企业微信channel中请填写，当被订阅时会自动回复， 可使用特殊占位符。目前支持的占位符有{trigger_prefix}，在程序中它会自动替换成bot的触发词。

**5.LinkAI配置 (可选)**

+ `use_linkai`: 是否使用LinkAI接口，开启后可国内访问，使用知识库和 `Midjourney` 绘画, 参考 [文档](https://link-ai.tech/platform/link-app/wechat)
+ `linkai_api_key`: LinkAI Api Key，可在 [控制台](https://link-ai.tech/console/interface) 创建
+ `linkai_app_code`: LinkAI 应用或工作流的code，选填

**本说明文档可能会未及时更新，当前所有可选的配置项均在该[`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py)中列出。**

## 三、运行

### 1.本地运行

如果是开发机 **本地运行**，直接在项目根目录下执行：

```bash
python3 app.py                                    # windows环境下该命令通常为 python app.py
```

终端输出二维码后，进行扫码登录，当输出 &quot;Start auto replying&quot; 时表示自动回复程序已经成功运行了（注意：用于登录的账号需要在支付处已完成实名认证）。扫码登录后你的账号就成为机器人了，可以在手机端通过配置的关键词触发自动回复 (任意好友发送消息给你，或是自己发消息给好友)，参考[#142](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/142)。

### 2.服务器部署

使用nohup命令在后台运行程序：

```bash
nohup python3 app.py &amp; tail -f nohup.out          # 在后台运行程序并通过日志输出二维码
```
扫码登录后程序即可运行于服务器后台，此时可通过 `ctrl+c` 关闭日志，不会影响后台程序的运行。使用 `ps -ef | grep app.py | grep -v grep` 命令可查看运行于后台的进程，如果想要重新启动程序可以先 `kill` 掉对应的进程。日志关闭后如果想要再次打开只需输入 `tail -f nohup.out`。此外，`scripts` 目录下有一键运行、关闭程序的脚本供使用。

&gt; **多账号支持：** 将项目复制多份，分别启动程序，用不同账号扫码登录即可实现同时运行。

&gt; **特殊指令：** 用户向机器人发送 **#reset** 即可清空该用户的上下文记忆。


### 3.Docker部署

&gt; 使用docker部署无需下载源码和安装依赖，只需要获取 docker-compose.yml 配置文件并启动容器即可。

&gt; 前提是需要安装好 `docker` 及 `docker-compose`，安装成功的表现是执行 `docker -v` 和 `docker-compose version` (或 docker compose version) 可以查看到版本号，可前往 [docker官网](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 进行下载。

**(1) 下载 docker-compose.yml 文件**

```bash
wget https://open-1317903499.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/docker-compose.yml
```

下载完成后打开 `docker-compose.yml` 修改所需配置，如 `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` 和 `GROUP_NAME_WHITE_LIST` 等。

**(2) 启动容器**

在 `docker-compose.yml` 所在目录下执行以下命令启动容器：

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

运行 `sudo docker ps` 能查看到 NAMES 为 chatgpt-on-wechat 的容器即表示运行成功。

注意：

 - 如果 `docker-compose` 是 1.X 版本 则需要执行 `sudo  docker-compose up -d` 来启动容器
 - 该命令会自动去 [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat) 拉取 latest 版本的镜像，latest 镜像会在每次项目 release 新的版本时生成

最后运行以下命令可查看容器运行日志，扫描日志中的二维码即可完成登录：

```bash
sudo docker logs -f chatgpt-on-wechat
```

**(3) 插件使用**

如果需要在docker容器中修改插件配置，可通过挂载的方式完成，将 [插件配置文件](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/plugins/config.json.template)
重命名为 `config.json`，放置于 `docker-compose.yml` 相同目录下，并在 `docker-compose.yml` 中的 `chatgpt-on-wechat` 部分下添加 `volumes` 映射:

```
volumes:
  - ./config.json:/app/plugins/config.json
```
**注**：采用docker方式部署的详细教程可以参考：[docker部署CoW项目](https://www.wangpc.cc/ai/docker-deploy-cow/)
### 4. Railway部署

&gt; Railway 每月提供5刀和最多500小时的免费额度。 (07.11更新: 目前大部分账号已无法免费部署)

1. 进入 [Railway](https://railway.app/template/qApznZ?referralCode=RC3znh)
2. 点击 `Deploy Now` 按钮。
3. 设置环境变量来重载程序运行的参数，例如`open_ai_api_key`, `character_desc`。

**一键部署:**

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. &lt;abbr title=&quot;also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense&quot;&gt;Completion&lt;/abbr&gt; everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenAPI&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as Swagger) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://json-schema.org/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JSON Schema&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;small&gt;* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.&lt;/small&gt;

## **Typer**, the FastAPI of CLIs

&lt;a href=&quot;https://typer.tiangolo.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://typer.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-margin-vector.svg&quot; style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

If you are building a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Command Line Interface&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/abbr&gt; app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://typer.tiangolo.com/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;**Typer**&lt;/a&gt;.

**Typer** is FastAPI&#039;s little sibling. And it&#039;s intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️ 🚀

## Requirements

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starlette.io/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Starlette&lt;/a&gt; for the web parts.
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pydantic.dev/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pydantic&lt;/a&gt; for the data parts.

## Installation

Create and activate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;virtual environment&lt;/a&gt; and then install FastAPI:

&lt;div class=&quot;termy&quot;&gt;

```console
$ pip install &quot;fastapi[standard]&quot;

---&gt; 100%
```

&lt;/div&gt;

**Note**: Make sure you put `&quot;fastapi[standard]&quot;` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.

## Example

### Create it

Create a file `main.py` with:

```Python
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)
def read_root():
    return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}


@app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;: q}
```

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Or use &lt;code&gt;async def&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/summary&gt;

If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```Python hl_lines=&quot;9  14&quot;
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)
async def read_root():
    return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}


@app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;: q}
```

**Note**:

If you don&#039;t know, check the _&quot;In a hurry?&quot;_ section about &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;`async` and `await` in the docs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Run it

Run the server with:

&lt;div class=&quot;termy&quot;&gt;

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;About the command &lt;code&gt;fastapi dev main.py&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/summary&gt;

The command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvicorn.org&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uvicorn&lt;/a&gt;.

By default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.

You can read more about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FastAPI CLI docs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Check it

Open your browser at &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery&lt;/a&gt;.

You will see the JSON response as:

```JSON
{&quot;item_id&quot;: 5, &quot;q&quot;: &quot;somequery&quot;}
```

You already created an API that:

* Receives HTTP requests in the _paths_ `/` and `/items/{item_id}`.
* Both _paths_ take `GET` &lt;em&gt;operations&lt;/em&gt; (also known as HTTP _methods_).
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has a _path parameter_ `item_id` that should be an `int`.
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has an optional `str` _query parameter_ `q`.

### Interactive API docs

Now go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&lt;/a&gt;.

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Swagger UI&lt;/a&gt;):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs

And now, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&lt;/a&gt;.

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ReDoc&lt;/a&gt;):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Example upgrade

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```Python hl_lines=&quot;4  9-12  25-27&quot;
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: Union[bool, None] = None


@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)
def read_root():
    return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}


@app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;: q}


@app.put(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {&quot;item_name&quot;: item.name, &quot;item_id&quot;: item_id}
```

The `fastapi dev` server should reload automatically.

### Interactive API docs upgrade

Now go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&lt;/a&gt;.

* The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Click on the button &quot;Try it out&quot;, it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

* Then click on the &quot;Execute&quot; button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade

And now, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&lt;/a&gt;.

* The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don&#039;t have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```Python
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```Python
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

* Editor support, including:
    * Completion.
    * Type checks.
* Validation of data:
    * Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
* &lt;abbr title=&quot;also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling&quot;&gt;Conversion&lt;/abbr&gt; of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    * JSON.
    * Path parameters.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies.
    * Headers.
    * Forms.
    * Files.
* &lt;abbr title=&quot;also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling&quot;&gt;Conversion&lt;/abbr&gt; of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    * Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    * `datetime` objects.
    * `UUID` objects.
    * Database models.
    * ...and many more.
* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.

---

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

* Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
* Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
    * If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.
* Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
    * As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
    * Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).
* For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, read the body as JSON:
    * Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
    * Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
    * Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
    * All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects.
* Convert from and to JSON automatically.
* Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by:
    * Interactive documentation systems.
    * Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.
* Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly.

---

We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.

Try changing the line with:

```Python
    return {&quot;item_name&quot;: item.name, &quot;item_id&quot;: item_id}
```

...from:

```Python
        ... &quot;item_name&quot;: item.name ...
```

...to:

```Python
        ... &quot;item_price&quot;: item.price ...
```

...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types:

![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)

## Welcome to sktime

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sktime.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/sktime/sktime/blob/main/docs/source/images/sktime-logo.svg&quot; width=&quot;175&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&gt; A unified interface for machine learning with time series

:rocket: **Version 0.37.0 out now!** [Check out the release notes here](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/changelog.html).

sktime is a library for time series analysis in Python. It provides a unified interface for multiple time series learning tasks. Currently, this includes forecasting, time series classification, clustering, anomaly/changepoint detection, and other tasks. It comes with [time series algorithms](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/estimator_overview.html) and [scikit-learn] compatible tools to build, tune, and validate time series models.

[scikit-learn]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

## :dizzy: Features
Our objective is to enhance the interoperability and usability of the time series analysis ecosystem in its entirety. sktime provides a __unified interface for distinct but related time series learning tasks__. It features [__dedicated time series algorithms__](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/estimator_overview.html) and __tools for composite model building__,  such as pipelining, ensembling, tuning, and reduction, empowering users to apply algorithms designed for one task to another.

sktime also provides **interfaces to related libraries**, for example [scikit-learn], [statsmodels], [tsfresh], [PyOD], and [fbprophet], among others.

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Install sktime
For troubleshooting and detailed installation instructions, see the [documentation](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/installation.html).

- **Operating system**: macOS X · Linux · Windows 8.1 or higher
- **Python version**: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 (only 64-bit)
- **Package managers**: [pip] · [conda] (via `conda-forge`)

[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/

### pip
Using pip, sktime releases are available as source packages and binary wheels.
Available wheels are listed [here](https://pypi.org/simple/sktime/).

```bash
pip install sktime
```

or, with maximum dependencies,

```bash
pip install sktime[all_extras]
```

For curated sets of soft dependencies for specific learning tasks:

```bash
pip install sktime[forecasting]  # for selected forecasting dependencies
pip install sktime[forecasting,transformations]  # forecasters and transformers
```

or similar. Valid sets are:

* `forecasting`
* `transformations`
* `classification`
* `regression`
* `clustering`
* `param_est`
* `networks`
* `detection`
* `alignment`

Cave: in general, not all soft dependencies for a learning task are installed,
only a curated selection.

### conda
You can also install sktime from `conda` via the `conda-forge` channel.
The feedstock including the build recipe and configuration is maintained
in [this conda-forge repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/sktime-feedstock).

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge sktime
```

or, with maximum dependencies,

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge sktime-all-extras
```

(as `conda` does not support dependency sets,
flexible choice of soft dependencies is unavailable via `conda`)

y = load_airline()
y_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)
fh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)
forecaster = ThetaForecaster(sp=12)  # monthly seasonal periodicity
forecaster.fit(y_train)
y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)
mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.08661467738190656
```

### Time Series Classification

```python
from sktime.classification.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestClassifier

&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; &lt;h3&gt; WhatsApp and Telegram chat logs integration for digital avatar creation is coming ! &lt;/h3&gt;

## ✨核心功能
- 💫 涵盖打造数字分身的全链路方案，包括聊天数据导出、预处理、模型训练、部署
- 💬 使用微信聊天记录微调LLM，让大模型有&quot;那味儿&quot;
- 🔗 绑定到微信、QQ、Telegram、企微、飞书机器人，实现自己的数字分身
- 🛡️ 隐私信息过滤，本地化微调部署，数据安全可控

## 📋特性与说明

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; - WeClone仍在快速迭代期，当前效果不代表最终效果。  
&gt; - 微调LLM效果很大程度取决于模型大小、聊天数据的数量和质量，理论上模型越大，数据越多，效果越好。   
&gt; - Windows环境未进行严格测试，可以使用WSL作为运行环境。详细教程可点击[Windows部署指南](https://blog.051088.xyz/2025/05/14/WeClone-%E7%94%A8%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E8%81%8A%E5%A4%A9%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%89%93%E9%80%A0%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%9A%84AI%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E5%88%86%E8%BA%AB/)查看。

### 硬件要求

项目默认使用Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，LoRA方法对sft阶段微调，大约需要16GB显存。也可以使用[LLaMA Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/README_zh.md#%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B)支持的其他模型和方法。

需要显存的估算值：
| 方法                             | 精度 |   7B  |  14B  |  30B  |   70B  |   `x`B  |
| ------------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Full (`bf16` or `fp16`)         |  32  | 120GB | 240GB | 600GB | 1200GB | `18x`GB |
| Full (`pure_bf16`)              |  16  |  60GB | 120GB | 300GB |  600GB |  `8x`GB |
| Freeze/LoRA/GaLore/APOLLO/BAdam |  16  |  16GB |  32GB |  64GB |  160GB |  `2x`GB |
| QLoRA                           |   8  |  10GB |  20GB |  40GB |   80GB |   `x`GB |
| QLoRA                           |   4  |   6GB |  12GB |  24GB |   48GB | `x/2`GB |
| QLoRA                           |   2  |   4GB |   8GB |  16GB |   24GB | `x/4`GB |


## 环境搭建
1.cuda安装(已安装可跳过，**要求版本12.4及以上**)：[LLaMA Factory](https://llamafactory.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/getting_started/installation.html#cuda) 

2.建议使用 [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)安装依赖，这是一个非常快速的 Python 环境管理器。安装uv后，您可以使用以下命令创建一个新的Python环境并安装依赖项，注意这不包含音频克隆功能的依赖：
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xming521/WeClone.git
cd WeClone
uv venv .venv --python=3.10
source .venv/bin/activate # windows下执行 .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install --group main -e . 
```
&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 如果要使用最新的模型进行微调，需要手动安装最新版LLaMA Factory：`uv pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git`,同时其他依赖版本也可能需要修改，例如vllm pytorch transforms

3.将配置文件模板复制一份并重命名为`settings.jsonc`，后续配置修改在此文件进行：
```bash
cp settings.template.jsonc settings.jsonc
```
&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 训练以及推理相关配置统一在文件`settings.jsonc`

4.使用以下命令测试CUDA环境是否正确配置并可被PyTorch识别，Mac不需要：
```bash
python -c &quot;import torch; print(&#039;CUDA是否可用:&#039;, torch.cuda.is_available());&quot;
```

5.（可选）安装FlashAttention，加速训练和推理：`uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation`

## 模型下载
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://www.modelscope.cn/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.git
```
下载有问题使用其他方式下载：[模型的下载](https://www.modelscope.cn/docs/models/download)


## 数据准备

请使用[PyWxDump](https://github.com/xaoyaoo/PyWxDump)提取微信聊天记录（不支持4.0版本微信）。可以先将手机的聊天记录迁移（备份）到电脑，数据量更多一些。下载软件并解密数据库后，点击聊天备份，导出类型为CSV，可以导出多个联系人（不建议使用群聊记录），然后将导出的位于`wxdump_tmp/export` 的 `csv` 文件夹放在`./dataset`目录即可，也就是不同人聊天记录的文件夹一起放在 `./dataset/csv`。   

## 数据预处理

- 项目默认去除了数据中的手机号、身份证号、邮箱、网址。还在`settings.jsonc`中提供了一个禁用词词库`blocked_words`，可以自行添加需要过滤的词句（会默认去掉包括禁用词的整句）。
&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; 🚨 请一定注意保护个人隐私，不要泄露个人信息！

- 执行以下命令对数据进行处理，可以根据自己的聊天风格修改settings.jsonc的`make_dataset_args`。
```bash
weclone-cli make-dataset
```
- 目前仅支持时间窗口策略，根据`single_combine_time_window`将单人连续消息通过逗号连接合并为一句，根据`qa_match_time_window`匹配问答对。
- 可以启用`clean_dataset`中的`enable_clean`选项，对数据进行清洗，以达到更好效果。* 当前系统支持使用 `llm judge` 对聊天记录进行打分，提供 **vllm 离线推理** 和 **API 在线推理** 两种方式。可通过将 `settings.jsonc` 文件中的 `&quot;online_llm_clear&quot;: false` 修改为 `true` 来启用 API 在线推理模式，并配置相应的 `base_url`、`llm_api_key`、`model_name` 等参数。所有兼容 OpenAI 接口的模型均可接入。
- 在获得 `llm 打分分数分布情况` 后，可通过设置 `accept_score` 参数筛选可接受的分数区间，同时可适当降低 `train_sft_args` 中的 `lora_dropout` 参数，以提升模型的拟合效果。

## 配置参数并微调模型

- (可选)修改 `settings.jsonc` 的 `model_name_or_path` 和 `template` 选择本地下载好的其他模型。  
- 修改`per_device_train_batch_size`以及`gradient_accumulation_steps`来调整显存占用。  
- 可以根据自己数据集的数量和质量修改`train_sft_args`的`num_train_epochs`、`lora_rank`、`lora_dropout`等参数。

### 单卡训练
```bash
weclone-cli train-sft
```
多卡环境单卡训练，需要先执行 `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`

### 多卡训练
取消`settings.jsonc`中`deepspeed`行代码注释，使用以下命令多卡训练：
```bash
uv pip install deepspeed
deepspeed --num_gpus=使用显卡数量 weclone/train/train_sft.py
```

### 使用浏览器demo简单推理
可以在这一步测试出合适的temperature、top_p值，修改settings.jsonc的`infer_args`后，供后续推理时使用。
```bash
weclone-cli webchat-demo
```

### 使用接口进行推理

```bash
weclone-cli server
```

### 使用常见聊天问题测试
不包含询问个人信息的问题，仅有日常聊天。测试结果在test_result-my.txt。
```bash
weclone-cli server
weclone-cli test-model
```

## 🖼️ 微调效果
使用Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct模型，大概3万条处理后的有效数据，loss降到了3.5左右的效果。

## What is Agno?

[Agno](https://docs.agno.com) is a lightweight, high-performance library for building Agents.

It helps you progressively build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:
- Level 1: Agents with tools and instructions.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge and storage.
- Level 3: Agents with memory and reasoning.
- Level 4: Teams of Agents with collaboration and coordination.
- Level 5: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism.

Here&#039;s a Investment Research Agent that analyzes stocks, reasoning through each step:

```python reasoning_finance_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id=&quot;claude-3-7-sonnet-latest&quot;),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions=[
        &quot;Use tables to display data&quot;,
        &quot;Only output the report, no other text&quot;,
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response(&quot;Write a report on NVDA&quot;, stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)
```

## Key features

Agno is simple, fast and model-agnostic. Here are some key features:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno Agents can connect to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Lightning Fast**: - **Lightning Fast**: Agents instantiate in **~3μs** and use **~5Kib** memory on average (see [performance](#performance) for more details).
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Make your Agents &quot;think&quot; and &quot;analyze&quot; using Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
- **Natively Multi Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi modal, they can take in text, image, audio and video and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with 3 different modes: `route`, `collaborate` and `coordinate`.
- **Agentic Search built-in**: Give your Agents the ability to search for information at runtime using one of 20+ vector databases. Get access to state-of-the-art Agentic RAG that uses hybrid search with re-ranking. **Fully async and highly performant.**
- **Long-term Memory &amp; Session Storage**: Agno provides plug-n-play `Storage` &amp; `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
- **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: Agno provides pre-built FastAPI routes to serve your Agents, Teams and Workflows.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Building Agents with Agno

If you&#039;re new to Agno, start by building your [first Agent](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/agents), chat with it on the [playground](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/playground) and finally, monitor it on [agno.com](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/monitoring).

After that, checkout the [Examples Gallery](https://docs.agno.com/examples) and build real-world applications with Agno.

## Installation

```shell
pip install -U agno
```

## What are Agents?

**Agents** are AI programs that operate autonomously.

- The core of an Agent is a model, tools and instructions.
- Agents also have **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and the ability to **reason**.

Read more about each of these in the [docs](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/agents#what-are-agents%3F).

&gt; Let&#039;s build a few Agents to see how they work.

## Example - Reasoning Agent

Let&#039;s start with a Reasoning Agent so we get a sense of Agno&#039;s capabilities.

Save this code to a file: `reasoning_agent.py`.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id=&quot;claude-3-7-sonnet-latest&quot;),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(
            stock_price=True,
            analyst_recommendations=True,
            company_info=True,
            company_news=True,
        ),
    ],
    instructions=[
        &quot;Use tables to display data&quot;,
        &quot;Only output the report, no other text&quot;,
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response(
    &quot;Write a report on NVDA&quot;,
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True,
)
```

Then create a virtual environment, install dependencies, export your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and run the agent.

```shell
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install agno anthropic yfinance

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxx

python reasoning_agent.py
```

We can see the Agent is reasoning through the task, using the `ReasoningTools` and `YFinanceTools` to gather information. This is how the output looks like:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb99955-9848-49a9-9732-3e19d77b2ff8

&gt; Now let&#039;s walk through the simple -&gt; tools -&gt; knowledge -&gt; teams of agents flow.

## Example - Basic Agent

The simplest Agent is just an inference task, no tools, no memory, no knowledge.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    description=&quot;You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!&quot;,
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response(&quot;Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.&quot;, stream=True)
```

To run the agent, install dependencies and export your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```shell
pip install agno openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx

python basic_agent.py
```

[View this example in the cookbook](./cookbook/getting_started/01_basic_agent.py)

## Example - Agent with tools

This basic agent will obviously make up a story, lets give it a tool to search the web.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    description=&quot;You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!&quot;,
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response(&quot;Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.&quot;, stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent:

```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search

python agent_with_tools.py
```

Now you should see a much more relevant result.

[View this example in the cookbook](./cookbook/getting_started/02_agent_with_tools.py)

## Example - Agent with knowledge

Agents can store knowledge in a vector database and use it for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.

**Agno agents use Agentic RAG** by default, which means they will search their knowledge base for the specific information they need to achieve their task.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    description=&quot;You are a Thai cuisine expert!&quot;,
    instructions=[
        &quot;Search your knowledge base for Thai recipes.&quot;,
        &quot;If the question is better suited for the web, search the web to fill in gaps.&quot;,
        &quot;Prefer the information in your knowledge base over the web results.&quot;
    ],
    knowledge=PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
        urls=[&quot;https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf&quot;],
        vector_db=LanceDb(
            uri=&quot;tmp/lancedb&quot;,
            table_name=&quot;recipes&quot;,
            search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
            embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id=&quot;text-embedding-3-small&quot;),
        ),
    ),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Comment out after the knowledge base is loaded
if agent.knowledge is not None:
    agent.knowledge.load()

agent.print_response(&quot;How do I make chicken and galangal in coconut milk soup&quot;, stream=True)
agent.print_response(&quot;What is the history of Thai curry?&quot;, stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent:

```shell
pip install lancedb tantivy pypdf duckduckgo-search

python agent_with_knowledge.py
```

[View this example in the cookbook](./cookbook/getting_started/03_agent_with_knowledge.py)

## Example - Multi Agent Teams

Agents work best when they have a singular purpose, a narrow scope and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the language model can handle or the tools belong to different categories, use a team of agents to spread the load.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from agno.team import Team

web_agent = Agent(
    name=&quot;Web Agent&quot;,
    role=&quot;Search the web for information&quot;,
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=&quot;Always include sources&quot;,
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name=&quot;Finance Agent&quot;,
    role=&quot;Get financial data&quot;,
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions=&quot;Use tables to display data&quot;,
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team = Team(
    mode=&quot;coordinate&quot;,
    members=[web_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    success_criteria=&quot;A comprehensive financial news report with clear sections and data-driven insights.&quot;,
    instructions=[&quot;Always include sources&quot;, &quot;Use tables to display data&quot;],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team.print_response(&quot;What&#039;s the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?&quot;, stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent team:

```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search yfinance

python agent_team.py
```

Reach out to support@agno.com to get involved.

## Performance

At Agno, we&#039;re obsessed with performance. Why? because even simple AI workflows can spawn thousands of Agents to achieve their goals. Scale that to a modest number of users and performance becomes a bottleneck. Agno is designed to power high performance agentic systems:

- Agent instantiation: ~3μs on average
- Memory footprint: ~6.5Kib on average

&gt; Tested on an Apple M4 Mackbook Pro.

While an Agent&#039;s run-time is bottlenecked by inference, we must do everything possible to minimize execution time, reduce memory usage, and parallelize tool calls. These numbers may seem trivial at first, but our experience shows that they add up even at a reasonably small scale.

### Instantiation time

Let&#039;s measure the time it takes for an Agent with 1 tool to start up. We&#039;ll run the evaluation 1000 times to get a baseline measurement.

You should run the evaluation yourself on your own machine, please, do not take these results at face value.

```shell
# Setup virtual environment
./scripts/perf_setup.sh
source .venvs/perfenv/bin/activate
# OR Install dependencies manually
# pip install openai agno langgraph langchain_openai

# Agno
python evals/performance/instantiation_with_tool.py

# LangGraph
python evals/performance/other/langgraph_instantiation.py
```

&gt; The following evaluation is run on an Apple M4 Mackbook Pro. It also runs as a Github action on this repo.

LangGraph is on the right, **let&#039;s start it first and give it a head start**.

Agno is on the left, notice how it finishes before LangGraph gets 1/2 way through the runtime measurement, and hasn&#039;t even started the memory measurement. That&#039;s how fast Agno is.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba466d45-75dd-45ac-917b-0a56c5742e23

### Memory usage

To measure memory usage, we use the `tracemalloc` library. We first calculate a baseline memory usage by running an empty function, then run the Agent 1000x times and calculate the difference. This gives a (reasonably) isolated measurement of the memory usage of the Agent.

We recommend running the evaluation yourself on your own machine, and digging into the code to see how it works. If we&#039;ve made a mistake, please let us know.

### Conclusion

Agno agents are designed for performance and while we do share some benchmarks against other frameworks, we should be mindful that accuracy and reliability are more important than speed.

We&#039;ll be publishing accuracy and reliability benchmarks running on Github actions in the future. Given that each framework is different and we won&#039;t be able to tune their performance like we do with Agno, for future benchmarks we&#039;ll only be comparing against ourselves.

## Cursor Setup

When building Agno agents, using Agno documentation as a source in Cursor is a great way to speed up your development.

1. In Cursor, go to the settings or preferences section.
2. Find the section to manage documentation sources.
3. Add `https://docs.agno.com` to the list of documentation URLs.
4. Save the changes.

Now, Cursor will have access to the Agno documentation.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt; ▶️ How is &lt;b&gt;SeleniumBase&lt;/b&gt; different from raw Selenium? (&lt;b&gt;click to expand&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase is a Python framework for browser automation and testing. SeleniumBase uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#endpoints&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selenium/WebDriver&lt;/a&gt; APIs and incorporates test-runners such as &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;pynose&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;behave&lt;/code&gt; to provide organized structure, test discovery, test execution, test state (&lt;i&gt;eg. passed, failed, or skipped&lt;/i&gt;), and command-line options for changing default settings (&lt;i&gt;eg. browser selection&lt;/i&gt;). With raw Selenium, you would need to set up your own options-parser for configuring tests from the command-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase&#039;s driver manager gives you more control over automatic driver downloads. (Use &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;--driver-version=VER&lt;/code&gt; with your &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; run command to specify the version.) By default, SeleniumBase will download a driver version that matches your major browser version if not set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase automatically detects between CSS Selectors and XPath, which means you don&#039;t need to specify the type of selector in your commands (&lt;i&gt;but optionally you could&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase methods often perform multiple actions in a single method call. For example, &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;self.type(selector, text)&lt;/code&gt; does the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. Waits for the element to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;2. Waits for the element to be interactive.&lt;br /&gt;3. Clears the text field.&lt;br /&gt;4. Types in the new text.&lt;br /&gt;5. Presses Enter/Submit if the text ends in &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&quot;\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;With raw Selenium, those actions require multiple method calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase uses default timeout values when not set:&lt;br /&gt;
✅ &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;self.click(&quot;button&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With raw Selenium, methods would fail instantly (&lt;i&gt;by default&lt;/i&gt;) if an element needed more time to load:&lt;br /&gt;
❌ &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;self.driver.find_element(by=&quot;css selector&quot;, value=&quot;button&quot;).click()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Reliable code is better than unreliable code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase lets you change the explicit timeout values of methods:&lt;br /&gt;
✅ &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;self.click(&quot;button&quot;, timeout=10)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With raw Selenium, that requires more code:&lt;br /&gt;
❌ &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(&quot;css selector&quot;, &quot;button&quot;)).click()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Simple code is better than complex code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase gives you clean error output when a test fails. With raw Selenium, error messages can get very messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase gives you the option to generate a dashboard and reports for tests. It also saves screenshots from failing tests to the &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;./latest_logs/&lt;/code&gt; folder. Raw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; does not have these options out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase includes desktop GUI apps for running tests, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/commander.md&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SeleniumBase Commander&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/behave_bdd/ReadMe.md&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SeleniumBase Behave GUI&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;behave&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/recorder_mode.md&quot;&gt;Recorder / Test Generator&lt;/a&gt; for creating tests from manual browser actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase comes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/case_plans.md&quot;&gt;test case management software, (&quot;CasePlans&quot;)&lt;/a&gt;, for organizing tests and step descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 SeleniumBase includes tools for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/chart_maker/ReadMe.md&quot;&gt;building data apps, (&quot;ChartMaker&quot;)&lt;/a&gt;, which can generate JavaScript from Python.&lt;/p&gt;

A CLI tool and Python library for interacting with **OpenAI**, **Anthropic’s Claude**, **Google’s Gemini**, **Meta’s Llama** and dozens of other Large Language Models, both via remote APIs and with models that can be installed and run on your own machine.

Watch **[Language models on the command-line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUXQNi6jQ30)** on YouTube for a demo or [read the accompanying detailed notes](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/).

With LLM you can:

- [Run prompts from the command-line](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#usage-executing-prompts)
- [Store prompts and responses in SQLite](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html#logging)
- [Generate and store embeddings](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/index.html#embeddings)
- [Extract structured content from text and images](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html#schemas)
- … and much, much more

## Quick start

First, install LLM using `pip` or Homebrew or `pipx` or `uv`:

```bash
pip install llm
```

Or with Homebrew (see [warning note](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html#homebrew-warning)):

```bash
brew install llm
```

Or with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
pipx install llm
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/)

```bash
uv tool install llm
```

If you have an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key you can run this:

```bash
# Paste your OpenAI API key into this
llm keys set openai

# Run a prompt (with the default gpt-4o-mini model)
llm &quot;Ten fun names for a pet pelican&quot;

# Extract text from an image
llm &quot;extract text&quot; -a scanned-document.jpg

# Use a system prompt against a file
cat myfile.py | llm -s &quot;Explain this code&quot;
```

Run prompts against [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) with their respective plugins:

```bash
llm install llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini
# Paste Gemini API key here
llm -m gemini-2.0-flash &#039;Tell me fun facts about Mountain View&#039;

llm install llm-anthropic
llm keys set anthropic
# Paste Anthropic API key here
llm -m claude-4-opus &#039;Impress me with wild facts about turnips&#039;
```

You can also [install a plugin](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/installing-plugins.html#installing-plugins) to access models that can run on your local device. If you use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/):

```bash
# Install the plugin
llm install llm-ollama

# Download and run a prompt against the Orca Mini 7B model
ollama pull llama3.2:latest
llm -m llama3.2:latest &#039;What is the capital of France?&#039;
```

To start [an interactive chat](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#usage-chat) with a model, use `llm chat`:

```bash
llm chat -m gpt-4.1
```

```default
Chatting with gpt-4.1
Type &#039;exit&#039; or &#039;quit&#039; to exit
Type &#039;!multi&#039; to enter multiple lines, then &#039;!end&#039; to finish
Type &#039;!edit&#039; to open your default editor and modify the prompt.
Type &#039;!fragment &lt;my_fragment&gt; [&lt;another_fragment&gt; ...]&#039; to insert one or more fragments
&gt; Tell me a joke about a pelican
Why don&#039;t pelicans like to tip waiters?

Because they always have a big bill!
```

### Pull Request Detection Template Structure Validation Check
As part of the PR checks we run a structure validation to make sure all required parts of the YAML structure are included.  For Detections, there is a new section that must be included.  See the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/wiki/Contribute-to-Sentinel-GitHub-Community-of-Queries#now-onto-the-how) for more information.  If this section or any other required section is not included, then a validation error will occur similar to the below.
The example is specifically if the YAML is missing the entityMappings section:

```
A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.
[xUnit.net 00:00:00.95]     Kqlvalidations.Tests.DetectionTemplateStructureValidationTests.Validate_DetectionTemplates_HaveValidTemplateStructure(detectionsYamlFileName: &quot;ExcessiveBlockedTrafficGeneratedbyUser.yaml&quot;) [FAIL]
  X Kqlvalidations.Tests.DetectionTemplateStructureValidationTests.Validate_DetectionTemplates_HaveValidTemplateStructure(detectionsYamlFileName: &quot;ExcessiveBlockedTrafficGeneratedbyUser.yaml&quot;) [104ms]
  Error Message:
   Expected object to be &lt;null&gt;, but found System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationException with message &quot;An old mapping for entity &#039;AccountCustomEntity&#039; does not have a matching new mapping entry.&quot;
```

### Pull Request KQL Validation Check
As part of the PR checks we run a syntax validation of the KQL queries defined in the template. If this check fails go to Azure Pipeline (by pressing on the errors link on the checks tab in your PR)
![Azurepipeline](.github/Media/Azurepipeline.png)
In the pipeline you can see which test failed and what is the cause:
![Pipeline Tests Tab](.github/Media/PipelineTestsTab.png)

Example error message:
```
A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.
[xUnit.net 00:00:01.81]     Kqlvalidations.Tests.KqlValidationTests.Validate_DetectionQueries_HaveValidKql(detectionsYamlFileName: &quot;ExcessiveBlockedTrafficGeneratedbyUser.yaml&quot;) [FAIL]
  X Kqlvalidations.Tests.KqlValidationTests.Validate_DetectionQueries_HaveValidKql(detectionsYamlFileName: &quot;ExcessiveBlockedTrafficGeneratedbyUser.yaml&quot;) [21ms]
  Error Message:
   Template Id:fa0ab69c-7124-4f62-acdd-61017cf6ce89 is not valid Errors:The name &#039;SymantecEndpointProtection&#039; does not refer to any known table, tabular variable or function., Code: &#039;KS204&#039;, Severity: &#039;Error&#039;, Location: &#039;67..93&#039;,The name &#039;SymantecEndpointProtection&#039; does not refer to any known table, tabular variable or function., Code: &#039;KS204&#039;, Severity: &#039;Error&#039;, Location: &#039;289..315&#039;
```
If you are using custom logs table (a table which is not defined on all workspaces by default) you should verify
your table schema is defined in json file in the folder *Azure-Sentinel\\.script\tests\KqlvalidationsTests\CustomTables*

**Example for table tablexyz.json**
```json
{
  &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;tablexyz&quot;,
  &quot;Properties&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;SomeDateTimeColumn&quot;,
      &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;DateTime&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;SomeStringColumn&quot;,
      &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;String&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;SomeDynamicColumn&quot;,
      &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Dynamic&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```
### Run KQL Validation Locally
In order to run the KQL validation before submitting Pull Request in you local machine:
* You need to have **.Net Core 3.1 SDK** installed [How to download .Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Supports all platforms)
* Open Shell and navigate to  `Azure-Sentinel\\.script\tests\KqlvalidationsTests\`
* Execute `dotnet test`

Example of output (in Ubuntu):
```

### Detection schema validation tests
Similarly to KQL Validation, there is an automatic validation of the schema of a detection.
The schema validation includes the detection&#039;s frequency and period, the detection&#039;s trigger type and threshold, validity of connectors Ids ([valid connectors Ids list](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/.script/tests/detectionTemplateSchemaValidation/ValidConnectorIds.json)), etc.
A wrong format or missing attributes will result with an informative check failure, which should guide you through the resolution of the issue, but make sure to look into the format of already approved detection.

### Run Detection Schema Validation Locally
In order to run the KQL validation before submitting Pull Request in you local machine:
* You need to have **.Net Core 3.1 SDK** installed [How to download .Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Supports all platforms)
* Open Shell and navigate to  `Azure-Sentinel\\.script\tests\DetectionTemplateSchemaValidation\`
* Execute `dotnet test`

# Purple Llama

Purple Llama is an umbrella project that over time will bring together tools
and evals to help the community build responsibly with open generative AI
models. The initial release will include tools and evals for Cyber Security and
Input/Output safeguards but we plan to contribute more in the near future.

## Why purple?

Borrowing a [concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_Fdp6FVDI) from the
cybersecurity world, we believe that to truly mitigate the challenges which
generative AI presents, we need to take both attack (red team) and defensive
(blue team) postures. Purple teaming, composed of both red and blue team
responsibilities, is a collaborative approach to evaluating and mitigating
potential risks and the same ethos applies to generative AI and hence our
investment in Purple Llama will be comprehensive.

## License

Components within the Purple Llama project will be licensed permissively enabling both research and commercial usage.
We believe this is a major step towards enabling community collaboration and standardizing the development and usage of trust and safety tools for generative AI development.
More concretely evals and benchmarks are licensed under the MIT license while any models use the corresponding Llama Community license. See the table below:

| **Component Type** |            **Components**            |                                          **License**                                           |

## System-Level Safeguards

As we outlined in Llama 3’s
[Responsible Use Guide](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/), we
recommend that all inputs and outputs to the LLM be checked and filtered in
accordance with content guidelines appropriate to the application.

### Llama Guard

Llama Guard 3 consists of a series of high-performance input and output moderation models designed to support developers to detect various common types of violating content.

They were built by fine-tuning Meta-Llama 3.1 and 3.2 models and optimized to support the detection of the MLCommons standard hazards taxonomy, catering to a range of developer use cases.
They support the release of Llama 3.2 capabilities, including 7 new languages, a 128k context window, and image reasoning. Llama Guard 3 models were also optimized to detect helpful cyberattack responses and prevent malicious code output by LLMs to be executed in hosting environments for Llama systems using code interpreters.


### Prompt Guard
Prompt Guard is a powerful tool for protecting LLM powered applications from malicious prompts to ensure their security and integrity.

Categories of prompt attacks include prompt injection and jailbreaking:

* Prompt Injections are inputs that exploit the inclusion of untrusted data from third parties into the context window of a model to get it to execute unintended instructions.
* Jailbreaks are malicious instructions designed to override the safety and security features built into a model.

### Code Shield

Code Shield adds support for inference-time filtering of insecure code produced by LLMs. Code Shield offers mitigation of insecure code suggestions risk, code interpreter abuse prevention, and secure command execution. [CodeShield Example Notebook](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/CodeShield/notebook/CodeShieldUsageDemo.ipynb).



## Evals &amp; Benchmarks

### Cybersecurity

#### CyberSec Eval v1
CyberSec Eval v1 was what we believe was the first industry-wide set of cybersecurity safety evaluations for LLMs. These benchmarks are based on industry guidance and standards (e.g., CWE and MITRE ATT&amp;CK) and built in collaboration with our security subject matter experts. We aim to provide tools that will help address some risks outlined in the [White House commitments on developing responsible AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/), including:
* Metrics for quantifying LLM cybersecurity risks.
* Tools to evaluate the frequency of insecure code suggestions.
* Tools to evaluate LLMs to make it harder to generate malicious code or aid in carrying out cyberattacks.

We believe these tools will reduce the frequency of LLMs suggesting insecure AI-generated code and reduce their helpfulness to cyber adversaries. Our initial results show that there are meaningful cybersecurity risks for LLMs, both with recommending insecure code and for complying with malicious requests. See our [Cybersec Eval paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/purple-llama-cyberseceval-a-benchmark-for-evaluating-the-cybersecurity-risks-of-large-language-models/) for more details.

#### CyberSec Eval 2
CyberSec Eval 2 expands on its predecessor by measuring an LLM’s propensity to abuse a code interpreter, offensive cybersecurity capabilities, and susceptibility to prompt injection. You can read the paper [here](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cyberseceval-2-a-wide-ranging-cybersecurity-evaluation-suite-for-large-language-models/).

You can also check out the 🤗 leaderboard [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/CyberSecEval).

#### CyberSec Eval 3
The newly released CyberSec Eval 3 features three additional test suites: visual prompt injection tests, spear phishing capability tests, and autonomous offensive cyber operations tests.

## Getting Started

As part of the [Llama reference system](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system), we’re integrating a safety layer to facilitate adoption and deployment of these safeguards.
Resources to get started with the safeguards are available in the [Llama-recipe GitHub repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes).

## Performance Tuning Guide

The performance is essential for on-policy RL algorithm. We have written a detailed [performance tuning guide](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/perf/perf_tuning.html) to help you optimize performance.

## Upgrade to vLLM &gt;= v0.8.2

verl now supports vLLM&gt;=0.8.2 when using FSDP as the training backend. Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/docs/README_vllm0.8.md) for the installation guide and more information. Please avoid vllm 0.7.x, which contains bugs that may lead to OOMs and unexpected errors.

## Use Latest SGLang

SGLang is fully supported with verl, and SGLang RL Group is working extensively on building unique features, including multi-turn agentic RL, VLM RLHF, server-based RL, and partial rollout. Please refer to [this document](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workers/sglang_worker.html) for the installation guide and more information.

## Upgrade to FSDP2

verl is fully embracing FSDP2! FSDP2 is recommended by torch distributed team, providing better throughput and memory usage, and is composible with other features (e.g. torch.compile). To enable FSDP2, simply use verl main and set the following options:
```
actor_rollout_ref.ref.strategy=fsdp2
actor_rollout_ref.actor.strategy=fsdp2
critic.strategy=fsdp2 
reward_model.strategy=fsdp2 
```
Furthermore, FSDP2 cpu offloading is compatible with gradient accumulation. You can turn it on to save memory with `actor_rollout_ref.actor.offload_policy=True`. For more details, see https://github.com/volcengine/verl/pull/1026

## [Hardware] Support AMD (ROCm Kernel)

verl now supports FSDP as the training engine (Megatron support coming soon) and both integrates with vLLM and SGLang as inference engines. Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/docs/amd_tutorial/amd_build_dockerfile_page.rst) for the installation guide and more information, and [this document](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/docs/amd_tutorial/amd_vllm_page.rst) for the vLLM performance tuning for ROCm.

## Logo and Trademark

The brand name ERPNext and the logo are trademarks of Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

### Introduction

Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Frappe) owns and oversees the trademarks for the ERPNext name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the ERPNext name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve ERPNext.
- We’d like to make it clear how ERPNext-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the ERPNext name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the ERPNext name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official ERPNext resources.

### Frappe Trademark Usage Policy

Permission from Frappe is required to use the ERPNext name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the ERPNext name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the ERPNext software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which ERPNext is distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the ERPNext name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use ERPNext as part of a domain name.

Use of the ERPNext name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other ERPNext-related businesses or projects can use the ERPNext name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by ERPNext or Frappe Technologies or the ERPNext open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering ERPNext consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The ERPNext Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the ERPNext logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use ERPNext as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around ERPNext. We encourage ERPNext-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

When in doubt about your use of the ERPNext name or logo, please contact Frappe Technologies for clarification.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># OpenAI Python API library

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/openai.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)

The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Python 3.8+
application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields,
and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

It is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).

## Documentation

The REST API documentation can be found on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference). The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

## Installation

```sh
# install from PyPI
pip install openai
```

## Usage

The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

The primary API for interacting with OpenAI models is the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses). You can generate text from the model with the code below.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;),
)

response = client.responses.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    instructions=&quot;You are a coding assistant that talks like a pirate.&quot;,
    input=&quot;How do I check if a Python object is an instance of a class?&quot;,
)

print(response.output_text)
```

The previous standard (supported indefinitely) for generating text is the [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). You can use that API to generate text from the model with the code below.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    messages=[
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;developer&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Talk like a pirate.&quot;},
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How do I check if a Python object is an instance of a class?&quot;,
        },
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument,
we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
to add `OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;My API Key&quot;` to your `.env` file
so that your API key is not stored in source control.
[Get an API key here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

### Vision

With an image URL:

```python
prompt = &quot;What is in this image?&quot;
img_url = &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/2023_06_08_Raccoon1.jpg/1599px-2023_06_08_Raccoon1.jpg&quot;

response = client.responses.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;,
    input=[
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: [
                {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;input_text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: prompt},
                {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;input_image&quot;, &quot;image_url&quot;: f&quot;{img_url}&quot;},
            ],
        }
    ],
)
```

With the image as a base64 encoded string:

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

prompt = &quot;What is in this image?&quot;
with open(&quot;path/to/image.png&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file:
    b64_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)

response = client.responses.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;,
    input=[
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: [
                {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;input_text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: prompt},
                {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;input_image&quot;, &quot;image_url&quot;: f&quot;data:image/png;base64,{b64_image}&quot;},
            ],
        }
    ],
)
```

## Async usage

Simply import `AsyncOpenAI` instead of `OpenAI` and use `await` with each API call:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;),
)


async def main() -&gt; None:
    response = await client.responses.create(
        model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;, input=&quot;Explain disestablishmentarianism to a smart five year old.&quot;
    )
    print(response.output_text)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.

## Streaming responses

We provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    input=&quot;Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.&quot;,
    stream=True,
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

The async client uses the exact same interface.

```python
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI()


async def main():
    stream = await client.responses.create(
        model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
        input=&quot;Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.&quot;,
        stream=True,
    )

    async for event in stream:
        print(event)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Realtime API beta

The Realtime API enables you to build low-latency, multi-modal conversational experiences. It currently supports text and audio as both input and output, as well as [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) through a WebSocket connection.

Under the hood the SDK uses the [`websockets`](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to manage connections.

The Realtime API works through a combination of client-sent events and server-sent events. Clients can send events to do things like update session configuration or send text and audio inputs. Server events confirm when audio responses have completed, or when a text response from the model has been received. A full event reference can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events) and a guide can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime).

Basic text based example:

```py
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

async def main():
    client = AsyncOpenAI()

    async with client.beta.realtime.connect(model=&quot;gpt-4o-realtime-preview&quot;) as connection:
        await connection.session.update(session={&#039;modalities&#039;: [&#039;text&#039;]})

        await connection.conversation.item.create(
            item={
                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;message&quot;,
                &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
                &quot;content&quot;: [{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;input_text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Say hello!&quot;}],
            }
        )
        await connection.response.create()

        async for event in connection:
            if event.type == &#039;response.text.delta&#039;:
                print(event.delta, flush=True, end=&quot;&quot;)

            elif event.type == &#039;response.text.done&#039;:
                print()

            elif event.type == &quot;response.done&quot;:
                break

asyncio.run(main())
```

However the real magic of the Realtime API is handling audio inputs / outputs, see this example [TUI script](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/examples/realtime/push_to_talk_app.py) for a fully fledged example.

### Realtime error handling

Whenever an error occurs, the Realtime API will send an [`error` event](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-model-capabilities#error-handling) and the connection will stay open and remain usable. This means you need to handle it yourself, as _no errors are raised directly_ by the SDK when an `error` event comes in.

```py
client = AsyncOpenAI()

async with client.beta.realtime.connect(model=&quot;gpt-4o-realtime-preview&quot;) as connection:
    ...
    async for event in connection:
        if event.type == &#039;error&#039;:
            print(event.error.type)
            print(event.error.code)
            print(event.error.event_id)
            print(event.error.message)
```

## Using types

Nested request parameters are [TypedDicts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). Responses are [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev) which also provide helper methods for things like:

- Serializing back into JSON, `model.to_json()`
- Converting to a dictionary, `model.to_dict()`

Typed requests and responses provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor. If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` to `basic`.

## Pagination

List methods in the OpenAI API are paginated.

This library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

all_jobs = []
# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for job in client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
    limit=20,
):
    # Do something with job here
    all_jobs.append(job)
print(all_jobs)
```

Or, asynchronously:

```python
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI()


async def main() -&gt; None:
    all_jobs = []
    # Iterate through items across all pages, issuing requests as needed.
    async for job in client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
        limit=20,
    ):
        all_jobs.append(job)
    print(all_jobs)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Alternatively, you can use the `.has_next_page()`, `.next_page_info()`, or `.get_next_page()` methods for more granular control working with pages:

```python
first_page = await client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
    limit=20,
)
if first_page.has_next_page():
    print(f&quot;will fetch next page using these details: {first_page.next_page_info()}&quot;)
    next_page = await first_page.get_next_page()
    print(f&quot;number of items we just fetched: {len(next_page.data)}&quot;)

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

Or just work directly with the returned data:

```python
first_page = await client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
    limit=20,
)

print(f&quot;next page cursor: {first_page.after}&quot;)  # =&gt; &quot;next page cursor: ...&quot;
for job in first_page.data:
    print(job.id)

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

## Nested params

Nested parameters are dictionaries, typed using `TypedDict`, for example:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.responses.create(
    input=[
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How much ?&quot;,
        }
    ],
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
    response_format={&quot;type&quot;: &quot;json_object&quot;},
)
```

## File uploads

Request parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed as `bytes`, or a [`PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) instance or a tuple of `(filename, contents, media type)`.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

client.files.create(
    file=Path(&quot;input.jsonl&quot;),
    purpose=&quot;fine-tune&quot;,
)
```

The async client uses the exact same interface. If you pass a [`PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) instance, the file contents will be read asynchronously automatically.

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API (for example, due to network connection problems or a timeout), a subclass of `openai.APIConnectionError` is raised.

When the API returns a non-success status code (that is, 4xx or 5xx
response), a subclass of `openai.APIStatusError` is raised, containing `status_code` and `response` properties.

All errors inherit from `openai.APIError`.

```python
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

try:
    client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
        model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
        training_file=&quot;file-abc123&quot;,
    )
except openai.APIConnectionError as e:
    print(&quot;The server could not be reached&quot;)
    print(e.__cause__)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within httpx.
except openai.RateLimitError as e:
    print(&quot;A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.&quot;)
except openai.APIStatusError as e:
    print(&quot;Another non-200-range status code was received&quot;)
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.response)
```

Error codes are as follows:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| &gt;=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

## Request IDs

&gt; For more information on debugging requests, see [these docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/debugging-requests)

All object responses in the SDK provide a `_request_id` property which is added from the `x-request-id` response header so that you can quickly log failing requests and report them back to OpenAI.

```python
response = await client.responses.create(
    model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;,
    input=&quot;Say &#039;this is a test&#039;.&quot;,
)
print(response._request_id)  # req_123
```

Note that unlike other properties that use an `_` prefix, the `_request_id` property
_is_ public. Unless documented otherwise, _all_ other `_` prefix properties,
methods and modules are _private_.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]  
&gt; If you need to access request IDs for failed requests you must catch the `APIStatusError` exception

```python
import openai

try:
    completion = await client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Say this is a test&quot;}], model=&quot;gpt-4&quot;
    )
except openai.APIStatusError as exc:
    print(exc.request_id)  # req_123
    raise exc
```

## Retries

Certain errors are automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and &gt;=500 Internal errors are all retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable retry settings:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = OpenAI(
    # default is 2
    max_retries=0,
)

# Or, configure per-request:
client.with_options(max_retries=5).chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How can I get the name of the current day in JavaScript?&quot;,
        }
    ],
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
)
```

## Timeouts

By default requests time out after 10 minutes. You can configure this with a `timeout` option,
which accepts a float or an [`httpx.Timeout`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/timeouts/#fine-tuning-the-configuration) object:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = OpenAI(
    # 20 seconds (default is 10 minutes)
    timeout=20.0,
)

# More granular control:
client = OpenAI(
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=5.0, write=10.0, connect=2.0),
)

# Override per-request:
client.with_options(timeout=5.0).chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How can I list all files in a directory using Python?&quot;,
        }
    ],
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
)
```

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests that time out are [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Advanced

### Logging

We use the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.

You can enable logging by setting the environment variable `OPENAI_LOG` to `info`.

```shell
$ export OPENAI_LOG=info
```

Or to `debug` for more verbose logging.

### How to tell whether `None` means `null` or missing

In an API response, a field may be explicitly `null`, or missing entirely; in either case, its value is `None` in this library. You can differentiate the two cases with `.model_fields_set`:

```py
if response.my_field is None:
  if &#039;my_field&#039; not in response.model_fields_set:
    print(&#039;Got json like {}, without a &quot;my_field&quot; key present at all.&#039;)
  else:
    print(&#039;Got json like {&quot;my_field&quot;: null}.&#039;)
```

### Accessing raw response data (e.g. headers)

The &quot;raw&quot; Response object can be accessed by prefixing `.with_raw_response.` to any HTTP method call, e.g.,

```py
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(
    messages=[{
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Say this is a test&quot;,
    }],
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
)
print(response.headers.get(&#039;X-My-Header&#039;))

completion = response.parse()  # get the object that `chat.completions.create()` would have returned
print(completion)
```

These methods return a [`LegacyAPIResponse`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/main/src/openai/_legacy_response.py) object. This is a legacy class as we&#039;re changing it slightly in the next major version.

For the sync client this will mostly be the same with the exception
of `content` &amp; `text` will be methods instead of properties. In the
async client, all methods will be async.

A migration script will be provided &amp; the migration in general should
be smooth.

#### `.with_streaming_response`

The above interface eagerly reads the full response body when you make the request, which may not always be what you want.

To stream the response body, use `.with_streaming_response` instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call `.read()`, `.text()`, `.json()`, `.iter_bytes()`, `.iter_text()`, `.iter_lines()` or `.parse()`. In the async client, these are async methods.

As such, `.with_streaming_response` methods return a different [`APIResponse`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/main/src/openai/_response.py) object, and the async client returns an [`AsyncAPIResponse`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/main/src/openai/_response.py) object.

```python
with client.chat.completions.with_streaming_response.create(
    messages=[
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
            &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Say this is a test&quot;,
        }
    ],
    model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,
) as response:
    print(response.headers.get(&quot;X-My-Header&quot;))

    for line in response.iter_lines():
        print(line)
```

The context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed.

### Making custom/undocumented requests

This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API.

If you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using `client.get`, `client.post`, and other
http verbs. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) when making this request.

```py
import httpx

response = client.post(
    &quot;/foo&quot;,
    cast_to=httpx.Response,
    body={&quot;my_param&quot;: True},
)

print(response.headers.get(&quot;x-foo&quot;))
```

#### Undocumented request params

If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the `extra_query`, `extra_body`, and `extra_headers` request
options.

#### Undocumented response properties

To access undocumented response properties, you can access the extra fields like `response.unknown_prop`. You
can also get all the extra fields on the Pydantic model as a dict with
[`response.model_extra`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_extra).

### Configuring the HTTP client

You can directly override the [httpx client](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client) to customize it for your use case, including:

- Support for [proxies](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/)
- Custom [transports](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/)
- Additional [advanced](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/clients/) functionality

```python
import httpx
from openai import OpenAI, DefaultHttpxClient

client = OpenAI(
    # Or use the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var
    base_url=&quot;http://my.test.server.example.com:8083/v1&quot;,
    http_client=DefaultHttpxClient(
        proxy=&quot;http://my.test.proxy.example.com&quot;,
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;),
    ),
)
```

You can also customize the client on a per-request basis by using `with_options()`:

```python
client.with_options(http_client=DefaultHttpxClient(...))
```

### Managing HTTP resources

### Unable to install?

The present program needs an AI model(`wybxc/DocLayout-YOLO-DocStructBench-onnx`) before working and some users are not able to download due to network issues. If you have a problem with downloading this model, we provide a workaround using the following environment variable:

```shell
set HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
```

For PowerShell user:

```shell
$env:HF_ENDPOINT = https://hf-mirror.com
```

If the solution does not work to you / you encountered other issues, please refer to [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate/wiki#-faq--%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98).

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Advanced Options&lt;/h2&gt;

Execute the translation command in the command line to generate the translated document `example-mono.pdf` and the bilingual document `example-dual.pdf` in the current working directory. Use Google as the default translation service. More support translation services can find [HERE](https://github.com/Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate/blob/main/docs/ADVANCED.md#services).
