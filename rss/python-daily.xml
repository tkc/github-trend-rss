# Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1447831134212984903?color=5865F2&amp;label=discord&amp;labelColor=black&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/gdXc48gSyT) [![Follow us on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/follow-us-on-hf-md-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/heretic-org)

Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka &quot;safety alignment&quot;) from
transformer-based language models without expensive post-training.
It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known
as &quot;abliteration&quot; ([Arditi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717),
Lai 2025 ([1](https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/projected-abliteration),
[2](https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/norm-preserving-biprojected-abliteration))),
with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).

This approach enables Heretic to work **completely automatically.** Heretic
finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of
refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a
decensored model that retains as much of the original model&#039;s intelligence
as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer
internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program
can use Heretic to decensor language models.

&lt;img width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;715&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a5efa-d6be-4705-a817-63332afb2d15&quot; /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce
decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually
by human experts:

| Model | Refusals for &quot;harmful&quot; prompts | KL divergence from original model for &quot;harmless&quot; prompts |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| [google/gemma-3-12b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it) (original) | 97/100 | 0 *(by definition)* |
| [mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2) | 3/100 | 1.04 |
| [huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated](https://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated) | 3/100 | 0.45 |
| **[p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic) (ours)** | **3/100** | **0.16** |

The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same
level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower
KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model&#039;s capabilities.
*(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic&#039;s built-in evaluation functionality,
e.g. `heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic`.
Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent.
The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)*

Of course, mathematical metrics and automated benchmarks never tell the whole
story, and are no substitute for human evaluation. Models generated with
Heretic have been well-received by users (links and emphasis added):

&gt; &quot;I was skeptical before, but I just downloaded
&gt; [**GPT-OSS 20B Heretic**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic)
&gt; model and holy shit. It gives properly formatted long responses to sensitive topics,
&gt; using the exact uncensored words that you would expect from an uncensored model,
&gt; produces markdown format tables with details and whatnot. Looks like this is
&gt; the best abliterated version of this model so far...&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/np6tba6/)

&gt; &quot;[**Heretic GPT 20b**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic)
&gt; seems to be the best uncensored model I have tried yet. It doesn&#039;t destroy a
&gt; the model&#039;s intelligence and it is answering prompts normally would be
&gt; rejected by the base model.&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/npe9jng/)

&gt; &quot;[[**Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic)]
&gt; Has been the best unquantized abliterated model that I have been able to run on 16gb vram.&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1phjxca/im_calling_these_people_out_right_now/nt06tji/)

Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and
several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models,
models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.

You can find a small collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic
[on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary),
and the community has created and published
[well over 1,000](https://huggingface.co/models?other=heretic)
Heretic models in addition to those.


## Usage

Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate
for your hardware. Then run:

```
pip install -U heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
```

Replace `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` with whatever model you want to decensor.

The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however,
Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for
greater control. Run `heretic --help` to see available command-line options,
or look at [`config.default.toml`](config.default.toml) if you prefer to use
a configuration file.

At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine
the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware.
On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
takes about 45 minutes. Note that Heretic supports model quantization with
bitsandbytes, which can drastically reduce the amount of VRAM required to process
models. Set the `quantization` option to `bnb_4bit` to enable quantization.

After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to
save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works,
or any combination of those actions.


## Research features

In addition to its primary function of removing model censorship, Heretic also
provides features designed to support research into the semantics of model internals
(interpretability). To use those features, you need to install Heretic with the
optional `research` extra:

```
pip install -U heretic-llm[research]
```

This gives you access to the following functionality:

### Generate plots of residual vectors by passing `--plot-residuals`

When run with this flag, Heretic will:

1. Compute residual vectors (hidden states) for the first output token,
   for each transformer layer, for both &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; prompts.
2. Perform a [PaCMAP projection](https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP)
   from residual space to 2D-space.
3. Left-right align the projections of &quot;harmful&quot;/&quot;harmless&quot; residuals
   by their geometric medians to make projections for consecutive layers
   more similar. Additionally, PaCMAP is initialized with the previous
   layer&#039;s projections for each new layer, minimizing disruptive transitions.
4. Scatter-plot the projections, generating a PNG image for each layer.
5. Generate an animation showing how residuals transform between layers,
   as an animated GIF.

&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of residual vectors&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981aa6ed-5ab9-48f0-9abf-2b1a2c430295&quot; /&gt;

See [the configuration file](config.default.toml) for options that allow you
to control various aspects of the generated plots.

Note that PaCMAP is an expensive operation that is performed on the CPU.
For larger models, it can take an hour or more to compute projections
for all layers.

### Print details about residual geometry by passing `--print-residual-geometry`

If you are interested in a quantitative analysis of how residual vectors
for &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; prompts relate to each other, this flag gives you
the following table, packed with metrics that can facilitate understanding
the same (for [gemma-3-270m-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-270m-it)
in this case):

## How Heretic works

Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each
supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and
MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer
layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant &quot;refusal direction&quot;,
inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications
with that matrix.

Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between
the first-token residuals for &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; example prompts.

The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:

* `direction_index`: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special
  value `per layer`, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the
  refusal direction associated with that layer.
* `max_weight`, `max_weight_position`, `min_weight`, and `min_weight_distance`:
  For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the
  ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:

&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Explanation&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e4b84e-5a82-4faf-b918-ac642f9e4892&quot; /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Heretic&#039;s main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:

* The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with
  automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff.
  Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in
  [gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2).
* The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral
  values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated.
  This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified
  by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization
  process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.
* Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that
  MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions,
  so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.


## Prior art

I&#039;m aware of the following publicly available implementations of abliteration
techniques:

* [AutoAbliteration](https://huggingface.co/posts/mlabonne/714992455492422)
* [abliterator.py](https://github.com/FailSpy/abliterator)
* [wassname&#039;s Abliterator](https://github.com/wassname/abliterator)
* [ErisForge](https://github.com/Tsadoq/ErisForge)
* [Removing refusals with HF Transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers)
* [deccp](https://github.com/AUGMXNT/deccp)

Note that Heretic was written from scratch, and does not reuse code from
any of those projects.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Hummingbot is using Docker:

* To install the Telegram Bot [Condor](https://github.com/hummingbot/condor), follow the instructions in the [Hummingbot Docs](https://hummingbot.org/condor/installation/) site.

* To install the CLI-based Hummingbot client, follow the instructions below.

Alternatively, if you are building new connectors/strategies or adding custom code, see the [Install from Source](https://hummingbot.org/client/installation/#source-installation) section in the documentation.

### Install Hummingbot with Docker

Install [Docker Compose website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Clone the repo and use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot

# Run Setup &amp; Deploy
make setup
make deploy

# Attach to the running instance
docker attach hummingbot
```

### Install Hummingbot + Gateway DEX Middleware

Gateway provides standardized connectors for interacting with automatic market maker (AMM) decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across different blockchain networks.

To run Hummingbot with Gateway, clone the repo and answer `y` when prompted after running `make setup`

```yaml
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
```
```bash
make setup

# Answer `y` when prompted
Include Gateway? [y/N]
```

Then run:
```bash
make deploy

# Attach to the running instance
docker attach hummingbot
```

By default, Gateway will start in development mode with unencrypted HTTP endpoints. To run in production model with encrypted HTTPS, use the `DEV=false` flag and run `gateway generate-certs` in Hummingbot to generate the certificates needed. See [Development vs Production Modes](http://hummingbot.org/gateway/installation/#development-vs-production-modes) for more information.

## Exchange Connectors

Hummingbot connectors standardize REST and WebSocket API interfaces to different types of exchanges, enabling you to build sophisticated trading strategies that can be deployed across many exchanges with minimal changes.

### Connector Types

We classify exchange connectors into three main categories:

* **CLOB CEX**: Centralized exchanges with central limit order books that take custody of your funds. Connect via API keys.
  - **Spot**: Trading spot markets
  - **Perpetual**: Trading perpetual futures markets

* **CLOB DEX**: Decentralized exchanges with on-chain central limit order books. Non-custodial, connect via wallet keys.
  - **Spot**: Trading spot markets on-chain
  - **Perpetual**: Trading perpetual futures on-chain

* **AMM DEX**: Decentralized exchanges using Automated Market Maker protocols. Non-custodial, connect via Gateway middleware.
  - **Router**: DEX aggregators that find optimal swap routes
  - **AMM**: Traditional constant product (x*y=k) pools
  - **CLMM**: Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker pools with custom price ranges

&lt;/div&gt;

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a67db2b5-672a-43df-b709-149c8eaee975

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LiteLLM-supported provider

## Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/GH05TCREW/pentestagent.git
cd pentestagent

# Setup (creates venv, installs deps)
.\scripts\setup.ps1   # Windows
./scripts/setup.sh    # Linux/macOS

# Or manual
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/macOS
pip install -e &quot;.[all]&quot;
playwright install chromium  # Required for browser tool
```

## Configure

Create `.env` in the project root:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
PENTESTAGENT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

Or for OpenAI:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
PENTESTAGENT_MODEL=gpt-5
```

Any [LiteLLM-supported model](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) works.

## Run

```bash
pentestagent                    # Launch TUI
pentestagent -t 192.168.1.1     # Launch with target
pentestagent --docker           # Run tools in Docker container
```

## Docker

Run tools inside a Docker container for isolation and pre-installed pentesting tools.

### Option 1: Pull pre-built image (fastest)

```bash
# Base image with nmap, netcat, curl
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key \
  -e PENTESTAGENT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
  ghcr.io/gh05tcrew/pentestagent:latest

# Kali image with metasploit, sqlmap, hydra, etc.
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key \
  ghcr.io/gh05tcrew/pentestagent:kali
```

### Option 2: Build locally

```bash
# Build
docker compose build

# Run
docker compose run --rm pentestagent

# Or with Kali
docker compose --profile kali build
docker compose --profile kali run --rm pentestagent-kali
```

The container runs PentestAgent with access to Linux pentesting tools. The agent can use `nmap`, `msfconsole`, `sqlmap`, etc. directly via the terminal tool.

Requires Docker to be installed and running.

## Modes

PentestAgent has three modes, accessible via commands in the TUI:

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Assist | (default) | Chat with the agent. You control the flow. |
| Agent | `/agent &lt;task&gt;` | Autonomous execution of a single task. |
| Crew | `/crew &lt;task&gt;` | Multi-agent mode. Orchestrator spawns specialized workers. |

### TUI Commands

```
/agent &lt;task&gt;    Run autonomous agent on task
/crew &lt;task&gt;     Run multi-agent crew on task
/target &lt;host&gt;   Set target
/tools           List available tools
/notes           Show saved notes
/report          Generate report from session
/memory          Show token/memory usage
/prompt          Show system prompt
/mcp &lt;list/add&gt;  Visualizes or adds a new MCP server.
/clear           Clear chat and history
/quit            Exit (also /exit, /q)
/help            Show help (also /h, /?)
```

Press `Esc` to stop a running agent. `Ctrl+Q` to quit.

## Playbooks

PentestAgent includes prebuilt **attack playbooks** for black-box security testing. Playbooks define a structured approach to specific security assessments.

**Run a playbook:**

```bash
pentestagent run -t example.com --playbook thp3_web
```

![Playbook Demo](assets/playbook.gif)

## Tools

PentestAgent includes built-in tools and supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for extensibility.

**Built-in tools:** `terminal`, `browser`, `notes`, `web_search` (requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`)

### MCP Integration

PentestAgent supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Configure `mcp_servers.json` for any MCP servers they intend to use. Example
config (place under `mcp_servers.json`):

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;nmap&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-y&quot;, &quot;gc-nmap-mcp&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;NMAP_PATH&quot;: &quot;/usr/bin/nmap&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### CLI Tool Management

```bash
pentestagent tools list         # List all tools
pentestagent tools info &lt;name&gt;  # Show tool details
pentestagent mcp list           # List MCP servers
pentestagent mcp add &lt;name&gt; &lt;command&gt; [args...]  # Add MCP server
pentestagent mcp test &lt;name&gt;    # Test MCP connection
```

## Knowledge

- **RAG:** Place methodologies, CVEs, or wordlists in `pentestagent/knowledge/sources/` for automatic context injection.
- **Notes:** Agents save findings to `loot/notes.json` with categories (`credential`, `vulnerability`, `finding`, `artifact`). Notes persist across sessions and are injected into agent context.
- **Shadow Graph:** In Crew mode, the orchestrator builds a knowledge graph from notes to derive strategic insights (e.g., &quot;We have credentials for host X&quot;).

## Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
# create venv
python -m venv .venv
````
## Activate venv
```bash
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
## Installation
```bash
# upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# install
pip install user-scanner
```
---
### Important Flags

See [Important flags](docs/FLAGS.md) here and use the tool powerfully


## Usage

### Basic username/email scan

Scan a single email or username across **all** available modules/platforms:

```bash
user-scanner -e john_doe@gmail.com   # single email scanning 
user-scanner -u john_doe             # single username scanning 
```

### Selective scanning

Scan only specific categories or single modules:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -c dev # developer platforms only
user-scanner -u john_doe -m github # only GitHub
```

### Bulk email/username scanning

Scan multiple emails/usernames from a file (one email/username per line):
- Can also be combined with categories or modules using `-c` , `-m` and other flags

```bash
user-scanner -ef emails.txt     # bulk email scan
user-scanner -uf usernames.txt  # bulk username scan
```
---
### Library mode for email_scan
Only available for `user-scanner&gt;=1.2.0`

See full usage (eg. category checks, full scan) guide [library usage](docs/USAGE.md)

- Email scan example (single module):

```python

import asyncio
from user_scanner.core import engine
from user_scanner.email_scan.dev import github

async def main():
    # Engine detects &#039;email_scan&#039; path -&gt; returns &quot;Registered&quot; status
    result = await engine.check(github, &quot;test@gmail.com&quot;)
    json_data = result.to_json() # returns JSON output
    csv_data = result.to_csv()   # returns CSV output
    print(json_data)             # prints the json data

asyncio.run(main())

```
Output:

```json

{
        &quot;email&quot;: &quot;test@gmail.com&quot;,
        &quot;category&quot;: &quot;Dev&quot;,
        &quot;site_name&quot;: &quot;Github&quot;,
        &quot;status&quot;: &quot;Registered&quot;,
        &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;&quot;
}

```
---


### Using Proxies

Validate proxies before scanning (tests each proxy against google.com):

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -P proxies.txt --validate-proxies # recommended
```

This will:
1. Filter out non-working proxies
2. Save working proxies to `validated_proxies.txt`
3. Use only validated proxies for scanning

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Some sites may return **403 Forbidden** or **connection timeout** errors, especially if they are blocked in your region (this is common with some adult sites).

- If a site is blocked in your region, use a VPN and select a region where you know the site is accessible.
- Then run the tool again.

These issues are caused by regional or network restrictions, not by the tool itself. If it still fails, report the error by opening an issue.

## Introduction

This project serves as a functional RAG UI for both end users who want to do QA on their
documents and developers who want to build their own RAG pipeline.
&lt;br&gt;

|     |     +----------------------------------------------------+     |     |
|     +----------------------------------------------------------------+     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### For end users

- **Clean &amp; Minimalistic UI**: A user-friendly interface for RAG-based QA.
- **Support for Various LLMs**: Compatible with LLM API providers (OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Cohere, etc.) and local LLMs (via `ollama` and `llama-cpp-python`).
- **Easy Installation**: Simple scripts to get you started quickly.

### For developers

- **Framework for RAG Pipelines**: Tools to build your own RAG-based document QA pipeline.
- **Customizable UI**: See your RAG pipeline in action with the provided UI, built with &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;Gradio &lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
- **Gradio Theme**: If you use Gradio for development, check out our theme here: [kotaemon-gradio-theme](https://github.com/lone17/kotaemon-gradio-theme).

## Key Features

- **Host your own document QA (RAG) web-UI**: Support multi-user login, organize your files in private/public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others.

- **Organize your LLM &amp; Embedding models**: Support both local LLMs &amp; popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq).

- **Hybrid RAG pipeline**: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text &amp; vector) retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality.

- **Multi-modal QA support**: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI).

- **Advanced citations with document preview**: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the _in-browser PDF viewer_ with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles.

- **Support complex reasoning methods**: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with `ReAct`, `ReWOO` and other agents.

- **Configurable settings UI**: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval &amp; generation process on the UI (incl. prompts).

- **Extensible**: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing &amp; retrieval. `GraphRAG` indexing pipeline is provided as an example.

## Installation

&gt; If you are not a developer and just want to use the app, please check out our easy-to-follow [User Guide](https://cinnamon.github.io/kotaemon/). Download the `.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/releases/latest) to get all the newest features and bug fixes.

### System requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) &gt;= 3.10
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): optional, if you [install with Docker](#with-docker-recommended)
3. [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation#full-installation) if you want to process files other than `.pdf`, `.html`, `.mhtml`, and `.xlsx` documents. Installation steps differ depending on your operating system. Please visit the link and follow the specific instructions provided there.

### With Docker (recommended)

1. We support both `lite` &amp; `full` version of Docker images. With `full` version, the extra packages of `unstructured` will be installed, which can support additional file types (`.doc`, `.docx`, ...) but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the `lite` image should work well in most cases.

   - To use the `full` version.

     ```bash
     docker run \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
     -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
     -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
     ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-full
     ```

   - To use the `full` version with bundled **Ollama** for _local / private RAG_.

     ```bash
     # change image name to
     docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-ollama
     ```

   - To use the `lite` version.

   ```bash
    # change image name to
    docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

2. We currently support and test two platforms: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (for newer Mac). You can specify the platform by passing `--platform` in the `docker run` command. For example:

   ```bash
   # To run docker with platform linux/arm64
   docker run \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
   -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
   -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
   --platform linux/arm64 \
   ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

3. Once everything is set up correctly, you can go to `http://localhost:7860/` to access the WebUI.

4. We use [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store docker images, all images can be found [here.](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/pkgs/container/kotaemon)

### Without Docker

1. Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment.

   ```shell
   # optional (setup env)
   conda create -n kotaemon python=3.10
   conda activate kotaemon

   # clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon
   cd kotaemon

   pip install -e &quot;libs/kotaemon[all]&quot;
   pip install -e &quot;libs/ktem&quot;
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of this project. Use `.env.example` as a template

   The `.env` file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app (e.g. deploy the app on HF hub). The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs.

3. (Optional) To enable in-browser `PDF_JS` viewer, download [PDF_JS_DIST](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v4.0.379/pdfjs-4.0.379-dist.zip) then extract it to `libs/ktem/ktem/assets/prebuilt`

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/pdf-viewer-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;pdf-setup&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;

4. Start the web server:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

   - The app will be automatically launched in your browser.
   - Default username and password are both `admin`. You can set up additional users directly through the UI.

   ![Chat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/chat-tab.png)

5. Check the `Resources` tab and `LLMs and Embeddings` and ensure that your `api_key` value is set correctly from your `.env` file. If it is not set, you can set it there.

### Setup GraphRAG

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Official MS GraphRAG indexing only works with OpenAI or Ollama API.
&gt; We recommend most users to use NanoGraphRAG implementation for straightforward integration with Kotaemon.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup Nano GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install nano-GraphRAG: `pip install nano-graphrag`
- `nano-graphrag` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_NANO_GRAPHRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from NanoGraphRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup LIGHTRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install LightRAG: `pip install git+https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git`
- `LightRAG` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_LIGHTRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from LightRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup MS GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- **Non-Docker Installation**: If you are not using Docker, install GraphRAG with the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install &quot;graphrag&lt;=0.3.6&quot; future
  ```

- **Setting Up API KEY**: To use the GraphRAG retriever feature, ensure you set the `GRAPHRAG_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this directly in your environment or by adding it to a `.env` file.
- **Using Local Models and Custom Settings**: If you want to use GraphRAG with local models (like `Ollama`) or customize the default LLM and other configurations, set the `USE_CUSTOMIZED_GRAPHRAG_SETTING` environment variable to true. Then, adjust your settings in the `settings.yaml.example` file.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Setup Local Models (for local/private RAG)

See [Local model setup](docs/local_model.md).

### Setup multimodal document parsing (OCR, table parsing, figure extraction)

These options are available:

- [Azure Document Intelligence (API)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
- [Adobe PDF Extract (API)](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/)
- [Docling (local, open-source)](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling)
  - To use Docling, first install required dependencies: `pip install docling`

Select corresponding loaders in `Settings -&gt; Retrieval Settings -&gt; File loader`

### Customize your application

- By default, all application data is stored in the `./ktem_app_data` folder. You can back up or copy this folder to transfer your installation to a new machine.

- For advanced users or specific use cases, you can customize these files:

  - `flowsettings.py`
  - `.env`

#### `flowsettings.py`

This file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example
[here](flowsettings.py) as the starting point.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Notable settings&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
# setup your preferred document store (with full-text search capabilities)
KH_DOCSTORE=(Elasticsearch | LanceDB | SimpleFileDocumentStore)

# setup your preferred vectorstore (for vector-based search)
KH_VECTORSTORE=(ChromaDB | LanceDB | InMemory | Milvus | Qdrant)

# Enable / disable multimodal QA
KH_REASONINGS_USE_MULTIMODAL=True

# Setup your new reasoning pipeline or modify existing one.
KH_REASONINGS = [
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullDecomposeQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.react.ReactAgentPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.rewoo.RewooAgentPipeline&quot;,
]
```

&lt;/details&gt;

#### `.env`

This file provides another way to configure your models and credentials.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Configure model via the .env file&lt;/summary&gt;

- Alternatively, you can configure the models via the `.env` file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in the folder of the application. If you don&#039;t see it, you can create one.

- Currently, the following providers are supported:

  - **OpenAI**

    In the `.env` file, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your OpenAI API key in order
    to enable access to OpenAI&#039;s models. There are other variables that can be modified,
    please feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should
    work for most people.

    ```shell
    OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
    OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your OpenAI API key here&gt;
    OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
    OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Azure OpenAI**

    For OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API
    key. Your might also need to provide your developments&#039; name for the chat model and the
    embedding model depending on how you set up Azure development.

    ```shell
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
    AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-35-turbo
    AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Local Models**

    - Using `ollama` OpenAI compatible server:

      - Install [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and start the application.

      - Pull your model, for example:

        ```shell
        ollama pull llama3.1:8b
        ollama pull nomic-embed-text
        ```

      - Set the model names on web UI and make it as default:

        ![Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/models.png)

    - Using `GGUF` with `llama-cpp-python`

      You can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Currently, these model formats are supported:

      - GGUF

        You should choose a model whose size is less than your device&#039;s memory and should leave
        about 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available,
        then you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to
        give better generation but also take more processing time.

        Here are some recommendations and their size in memory:

      - [Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen1_5-1_8b-chat-q8_0.gguf?download=true): around 2 GB

        Add a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web UI.

  &lt;/details&gt;

### Adding your own RAG pipeline

#### Custom Reasoning Pipeline

1. Check the default pipeline implementation in [here](libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/simple.py). You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work.
2. Add new `.py` implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/` and later include it in `flowssettings` to enable it on the UI.

#### Custom Indexing Pipeline

- Check sample implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/graph`

&gt; (more instruction WIP).

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework that applies
software development principles to AI agent creation. It is designed to
simplify building, deploying, and orchestrating agent workflows, from simple
tasks to complex systems. While optimized for Gemini, ADK is model-agnostic,
deployment-agnostic, and compatible with other frameworks.

## 🔥 What&#039;s new

- **Custom Service Registration**: Add a service registry to provide a generic way to register custom service implementations to be used in FastAPI server. See [short instruction](https://github.com/google/adk-python/discussions/3175#discussioncomment-14745120). ([391628f](https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/391628fcdc7b950c6835f64ae3ccab197163c990))

- **Rewind**: Add the ability to rewind a session to before a previous invocation ([9dce06f](https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/9dce06f9b00259ec42241df4f6638955e783a9d1)).

- **New CodeExecutor**: Introduces a new AgentEngineSandboxCodeExecutor class that supports executing agent-generated code using the Vertex AI Code Execution Sandbox API ([ee39a89](https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/ee39a891106316b790621795b5cc529e89815a98))

## ✨ Key Features

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions,
  OpenAPI specs, MCP tools or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse
  capabilities, all for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

- **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
  directly in Python for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

- **Agent Config**: Build agents without code. Check out the
  [Agent Config](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/config/) feature.

- **Tool Confirmation**: A [tool confirmation flow(HITL)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/confirmation/) that can guard tool execution with explicit confirmation and custom input.

- **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
  multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

- **Deploy Anywhere**: Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or
  scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.

## 🚀 Installation

### Stable Release (Recommended)

You can install the latest stable version of ADK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

The release cadence is roughly bi-weekly.

This version is recommended for most users as it represents the most recent official release.

### Development Version
Bug fixes and new features are merged into the main branch on GitHub first. If you need access to changes that haven&#039;t been included in an official PyPI release yet, you can install directly from the main branch:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google/adk-python.git@main
```

Note: The development version is built directly from the latest code commits. While it includes the newest fixes and features, it may also contain experimental changes or bugs not present in the stable release. Use it primarily for testing upcoming changes or accessing critical fixes before they are officially released.

## 🤖 Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol and ADK Integration

For remote agent-to-agent communication, ADK integrates with the
[A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/).
See this [example](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents)
for how they can work together.

## 📚 Documentation

Explore the full documentation for detailed guides on building, evaluating, and
deploying agents:

* **[Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)**

## 🏁 Feature Highlight

### Define a single agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name=&quot;search_assistant&quot;,
    model=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;, # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction=&quot;You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.&quot;,
    description=&quot;An assistant that can search the web.&quot;,
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a multi-agent system:

Define a multi-agent system with coordinator agent, greeter agent, and task execution agent. Then ADK engine and the model will guide the agents to work together to accomplish the task.

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name=&quot;greeter&quot;, model=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;, ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name=&quot;task_executor&quot;, model=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;, ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name=&quot;Coordinator&quot;,
    model=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    description=&quot;I coordinate greetings and tasks.&quot;,
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Development UI

A built-in development UI to help you test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/adk-python/main/assets/adk-web-dev-ui-function-call.png&quot;/&gt;

###  Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```

Click on above image to watch the tutorial for installation and configuration or use this link https://youtu.be/f9rdz74e1lM (Recommended to watch it in 2x speed)

1. [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) or above. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and install Python, or for windows you could visit Microsoft Store and search for &quot;Python&quot;. **Please make sure Python is added to Path in System Environment Variables**.
2. Install necessary [Undetected Chromedriver](https://pypi.org/project/undetected-chromedriver/), [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) and [Setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) packages. After Python is installed, OPEN a console/terminal or shell, Use below command that uses the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) command-line tool to install these 3 package.
  ```
  pip install undetected-chromedriver pyautogui setuptools openai flask-cors flask
  ```
3. Download and install latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) in it&#039;s default location, visit https://www.google.com/chrome to download it&#039;s installer.
4. Clone the current git repo or download it as a zip file, url to the latest update https://github.com/GodsScion/Auto_job_applier_linkedIn.
5. (Not needed if you set `stealth_mode = True` in `config/settings.py` ) Download and install the appropriate [Chrome Driver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) for Google Chrome and paste it in the location Chrome was installed, visit https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ to download.
  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
  ***OR*** 
  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
  If you are using Windows, click on `windows-setup.bat` available in the `/setup` folder, this will install the latest chromedriver automatically.
6. If you have questions or need help setting it up or to talk in general, join the github server: https://discord.gg/fFp7uUzWCY

&lt;br&gt;

## 🔧 How to configure
1. Open `personals.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your details like name, phone number, address, etc. Whatever you want to fill in your applications.
2. Open `questions.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your answers for application questions, configure wether you want the bot to pause before submission or pause if it can&#039;t answer unknown questions.
3. Open `search.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your search preferences, job filters, configure the bot as per your needs (these settings decide which jobs to apply for or skip).
4. Open `secrets.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your LinkedIn username, password to login and OpenAI API Key for generation of job tailored resumes and cover letters (This entire step is optional). If you do not provide username or password or leave them as default, it will login with saved profile in browser, if failed will ask you to login manually.
5. Open `settings.py` file in `/config` folder to configure the bot settings like, keep screen awake, click intervals (click intervals are randomized to seem like human behavior), run in background, stealth mode (to avoid bot detection), etc. as per your needs.
6. (Optional) Don&#039;t forget to add you default resume in the location you mentioned in `default_resume_path = &quot;all resumes/default/resume.pdf&quot;` given in `/config/questions.py`. If one is not provided, it will use your previous resume submitted in LinkedIn or (In Development) generate custom resume if OpenAI APT key is provided!
7. Run `runAiBot.py` and see the magic happen.
8. To run the Applied Jobs history UI, run `app.py` and open web browser on `http://localhost:5000`.
8. If you have questions or need help setting it up or to talk in general, join the github server: https://discord.gg/fFp7uUzWCY

## 🧑‍💻 Contributor Guidelines
Thank you for your efforts and being a part of the community. All contributions are appreciated no matter how small or big. Once you contribute to the code base, your work will be remembered forever.

NOTE: Only Pull request to `community-version` branch will be accepted. Any other requests will be declined by default, especially to main branch.
Once your code is tested, your changes will be merged to the `main` branch in next cycle.

### Code Guidelines
  #### Functions:
  1. All functions or methods are named lower case and snake case
  2. Must have explanation of their purpose. Write explanation surrounded in `&#039;&#039;&#039; Explanation &#039;&#039;&#039;` under the definition `def function() -&gt; None:`. Example:
      ```python
      def function() -&gt; None:
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
        This function does nothing, it&#039;s just an example for explanation placement!
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
      ```
  4. The Types `(str, list, int, list[str], int | float)` for the parameters and returns must be given. Example:
      ```python
      def function(param1: str, param2: list[str], param3: int) -&gt; str:
      ```
  5. Putting all that together some valid examples for function or method declarations would be as follows.
      ```python
      def function_name_in_camel_case(parameter1: driver, parameter2: str) -&gt; list[str] | ValueError:
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
        This function is an example for code guidelines
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
        return [parameter2, parameter2.lower()]
      ```
  6. The hashtag comments on top of functions are optional, which are intended for developers `# Comments for developers`.
      ```python
      # Enter input text function
      def text_input_by_ID(driver: WebDriver, id: str, value: str, time: float=5.0) -&gt; None | Exception:
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          Enters `value` into the input field with the given `id` if found, else throws NotFoundException.
          - `time` is the max time to wait for the element to be found.
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          username_field = WebDriverWait(driver, time).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, id)))
          username_field.send_keys(Keys.CONTROL + &quot;a&quot;)
          username_field.send_keys(value)
      
      ```
   
  #### Variables
  1. All variables must start with lower case, must be in explainable full words. If someone reads the variable name, it should be easy to understand what the variable stores.
  2. All local variables are camel case. Examples:
      ```python
      jobListingsElement = None
      ```
      ```python
      localBufferTime = 5.5
      ```
  3. All global variables are snake case. Example:
      ```
      total_runs = 1
      ```
  4. Mentioning types are optional.
      ```python
      localBufferTime: float | int = 5.5
      ```
  
  #### Configuration variables
  1. All config variables are treated as global variables. They have some extra guidelines.
  2. Must have variable setting explanation, and examples of valid values. Examples:
      ```python
      # Explanation of what this setting will do, and instructions to enter it correctly
      config_variable = &quot;value1&quot;    #  &lt;Valid values examples, and NOTES&gt; &quot;value1&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;, etc. Don&#039;t forget quotes (&quot;&quot;)
      ```
      ```python
      # Do you want to randomize the search order for search_terms?
      randomize_search_order = False     # True of False, Note: True or False are case-sensitive
      ```
      ```python
      # Avoid applying to jobs if their required experience is above your current_experience. (Set value as -1 if you want to apply to all ignoring their required experience...)
      current_experience = 5             # Integers &gt; -2 (Ex: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...)
      ```
      ```python
      # Search location, this will be filled in &quot;City, state, or zip code&quot; search box. If left empty as &quot;&quot;, tool will not fill it.
      search_location = &quot;United States&quot;               # Some valid examples: &quot;&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Chicago, Illinois, United States&quot;, &quot;90001, Los Angeles, California, United States&quot;, &quot;Bengaluru, Karnataka, India&quot;, etc.

      ```
  4. Add the config variable in appropriate `/config/file`.
  5. Every config variable must be validated. Go to `/modules/validator.py` and add it over there. Example:
      For config variable `search_location = &quot;&quot;` found in `/config/search.py`, string validation is added in file `/modules/validator.py` under the method `def validate_search()`.
      ```python
      def validate_search() -&gt; None | ValueError | TypeError:
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          Validates all variables in the `/config/search.py` file.
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          check_string(search_location, &quot;search_location&quot;)
      ```
