## PostHog is an all-in-one, open source platform for building successful products

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) provides every tool you need to build a successful product including:

- [Product Analytics](https://posthog.com/product-analytics): Autocapture or manually instrument event-based analytics to understand user behavior and analyze data with visualization or SQL.
- [Web Analytics](https://posthog.com/web-analytics): Monitor web traffic and user sessions with a GA-like dashboard. Easily monitor conversion, web vitals, and revenue.
- [Session Replays](https://posthog.com/session-replay): Watch real user sessions of interactions with your website or mobile app to diagnose issues and understand user behavior.
- [Feature Flags](https://posthog.com/feature-flags): Safely roll out features to select users or cohorts with feature flags.
- [Experiments](https://posthog.com/experiments): Test changes and measure their statistical impact on goal metrics. Set up experiments with no-code too.
- [Error Tracking](https://posthog.com/error-tracking): Track errors, get alerts, and resolve issues to improve your product.
- [Surveys](https://posthog.com/surveys): Ask anything with our collection of no-code survey templates, or build custom surveys with our survey builder.
- [Data warehouse](https://posthog.com/data-warehouse): Sync data from external tools like Stripe, Hubspot, your data warehouse, and more. Query it alongside your product data.
- [Data pipelines](https://posthog.com/cdp): Run custom filters and transformations on your incoming data. Send it to 25+ tools or any webhook in real time or batch export large amounts to your warehouse.
- [LLM analytics](https://posthog.com/docs/llm-analytics): Capture traces, generations, latency, and cost for your LLM-powered app.
- [Workflows](https://posthog.com/docs/workflows): Create workflows that automate actions or send messages to your users.

Best of all, all of this is free to use with a [generous monthly free tier](https://posthog.com/pricing) for each product. Get started by signing up for [PostHog Cloud US](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup).

## Getting started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is signing up for free to [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses are free every month, after which you pay based on usage.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

If you want to self-host PostHog, you can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

```bash
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)&quot;
```

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend [migrating to a PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).

We _do not_ provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more info.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># TimesFM

TimesFM (Time Series Foundation Model) is a pretrained time-series foundation
model developed by Google Research for time-series forecasting.

*   Paper:
    [A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10688),
    ICML 2024.
*   All checkpoints:
    [TimesFM Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/timesfm-release-66e4be5fdb56e960c1e482a6).
*   [Google Research blog](https://research.google/blog/a-decoder-only-foundation-model-for-time-series-forecasting/).
*   [TimesFM in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/timesfm-model):
    an official Google product.

This open version is not an officially supported Google product.

**Latest Model Version:** TimesFM 2.5

**Archived Model Versions:**

-   1.0 and 2.0: relevant code archived in the sub directory `v1`. You can `pip
    install timesfm==1.3.0` to install an older version of this package to load
    them.

## Update - Oct. 29, 2025

Added back the covariate support through XReg for TimesFM 2.5.


## Update - Sept. 15, 2025

TimesFM 2.5 is out!

Comparing to TimesFM 2.0, this new 2.5 model:

-   uses 200M parameters, down from 500M.
-   supports up to 16k context length, up from 2048.
-   supports continuous quantile forecast up to 1k horizon via an optional 30M
    quantile head.
-   gets rid of the `frequency` indicator.
-   has a couple of new forecasting flags.

Along with the model upgrade we have also upgraded the inference API. This repo
will be under construction over the next few weeks to

1.  add support for an upcoming Flax version of the model (faster inference).
2.  add back covariate support.
3.  populate more docstrings, docs and notebook.

### Install

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/google-research/timesfm.git
    cd timesfm
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`:
    ```shell
    # Create a virtual environment
    uv venv
    
    # Activate the environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install the package in editable mode with torch
    uv pip install -e .[torch]
    # Or with flax
    uv pip install -e .[flax]
    # Or XReg is needed
    uv pip install -e .[xreg]
    ```

3. [Optional] Install your preferred `torch` / `jax` backend based on your OS and accelerators
(CPU, GPU, TPU or Apple Silicon).:

-   [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
-   [Install Jax](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#installation)
    for Flax.

### Code Example

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import timesfm

torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(&quot;high&quot;)

model = timesfm.TimesFM_2p5_200M_torch.from_pretrained(&quot;google/timesfm-2.5-200m-pytorch&quot;)

model.compile(
    timesfm.ForecastConfig(
        max_context=1024,
        max_horizon=256,
        normalize_inputs=True,
        use_continuous_quantile_head=True,
        force_flip_invariance=True,
        infer_is_positive=True,
        fix_quantile_crossing=True,
    )
)
point_forecast, quantile_forecast = model.forecast(
    horizon=12,
    inputs=[
        np.linspace(0, 1, 100),
        np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20, 67)),
    ],  # Two dummy inputs
)
point_forecast.shape  # (2, 12)
quantile_forecast.shape  # (2, 12, 10): mean, then 10th to 90th quantiles.
```

## Track from CLI

Point at a video, webcam, RTSP stream, or image directory. Get tracked output.

Use our [interactive command builder](https://trackers.roboflow.com/develop/learn/track) to configure your tracking pipeline.

```bash
trackers track \
    --source video.mp4 \
    --output output.mp4 \
    --model rfdetr-medium \
    --tracker bytetrack \
    --show-labels \
    --show-trajectories
```

## Track from Python

Plug trackers into your existing detection pipeline. Works with any detector.

```python
import cv2
import supervision as sv
from inference import get_model
from trackers import ByteTrackTracker

model = get_model(model_id=&quot;rfdetr-medium&quot;)
tracker = ByteTrackTracker()

label_annotator = sv.LabelAnnotator()
trajectory_annotator = sv.TrajectoryAnnotator()

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(&quot;video.mp4&quot;)
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    result = model.infer(frame)[0]
    detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(result)
    tracked = tracker.update(detections)

    frame = label_annotator.annotate(frame, tracked)
    frame = trajectory_annotator.annotate(frame, tracked)
```

## Evaluate

Benchmark your tracker against ground truth with standard MOT metrics.

```bash
trackers eval \
    --gt-dir data/gt \
    --tracker-dir data/trackers \
    --metrics CLEAR HOTA Identity
```

```
Sequence                        MOTA    HOTA    IDF1  IDSW
----------------------------------------------------------
MOT17-02-FRCNN                75.600  62.300  72.100    42

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Hugging Face Skills

Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic&#039;s Claude Code, Google DeepMind&#039;s Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## How do Skills work?

In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. 

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; &#039;Skills&#039; is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an `AGENTS.md` file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses &#039;extensions&#039; to define the instructions for your coding agent in a `gemini-extension.json` file. **This repo is compatible with all of them, and more!**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If your agent doesn&#039;t support skills, you can use [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) directly as a fallback.

## Installation

Hugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

### Claude Code

1. Register the repository as a plugin marketplace:  
   
```
/plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills
```

2. To install a skill, run:  
   
```
/plugin install &lt;skill-name&gt;@huggingface/skills
```

For example:  

```
/plugin install hugging-face-cli@huggingface/skills
```

### Codex

1. Codex will identify the skills via the `AGENTS.md` file. You can verify the instructions are loaded with:

```
codex --ask-for-approval never &quot;Summarize the current instructions.&quot;
```

2. For more details, see the [Codex AGENTS guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md).

### Gemini CLI

1. This repo includes `gemini-extension.json` to integrate with the Gemini CLI.

2. Install locally:  

```
gemini extensions install . --consent
```

or use the GitHub URL:

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent
```

4. See [Gemini CLI extensions docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/#installing-an-extension) for more help.

### Cursor

This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json` (configured with the Hugging Face MCP server URL)

Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow.

For contributors, regenerate manifests with:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

&lt;!-- END_SKILLS_TABLE --&gt;

### Using skills in your coding agent

Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions:

- &quot;Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch `run_eval_job.py` on the latest checkpoint.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model.&quot;

Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding `SKILL.md` instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task.

### Contribute or customize a skill

1. Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `hf-datasets/`) and rename it.
2. Update the new folder&#039;s `SKILL.md` frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill-name
   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
   ---

   # Skill Title
   Guidance + examples + guardrails
   ```
3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.
4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with a concise, human-readable description.
5. Run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/publish.sh
   ```
   to regenerate and validate all generated metadata.
6. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.

### Marketplace

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file lists skills with human-readable descriptions for the plugin marketplace. The CI validates that skill names and paths match between `SKILL.md` files and `marketplace.json`, but descriptions are maintained separately: `SKILL.md` descriptions guide when Claude activates the skill, while marketplace descriptions are written for humans browsing available skills.

### Additional references
- Browse the latest instructions, scripts, and templates directly at [huggingface/skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills).
- Review Hugging Face documentation for the specific libraries or workflows you reference inside each skill.

## Configuration

### Setup Wizard (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The wizard will:
- Generate encryption key
- Configure deployment mode (local/production)
- Set up authentication (production only)
- Create your `.env` file

### Manual Configuration

Copy and edit the example configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Required Settings

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts stored credentials (auto-generated by setup wizard) |

#### Deployment Settings (Production Only)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` | `local` or `production` |
| `DOMAIN` | Your domain name (e.g., `toolkit.example.com`) |
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | Admin username |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` | Bcrypt password hash (generated by setup wizard) |

#### UniFi Controller Settings

Configure via `.env` or the web UI (web UI takes precedence):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `UNIFI_CONTROLLER_URL` | Controller URL (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`) |
| `UNIFI_USERNAME` | Username (legacy controllers) |
| `UNIFI_PASSWORD` | Password (legacy controllers) |
| `UNIFI_API_KEY` | API key (UniFi OS: UDM, UCG, Cloud Key) |
| `UNIFI_SITE_ID` | Site ID from URL, not friendly name (default: `default`). For multi-site, use ID from `/manage/site/{id}/...` |
| `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL` | SSL verification (default: `false`) |

#### Tool Settings

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STALKER_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | Device refresh interval in seconds (default: `60`) |

---

## Security

### Authentication

- **Local mode**: No authentication (trusted LAN only)
- **Production mode**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Rate limiting**: 5 failed login attempts = 5 minute lockout

### HTTPS

Production deployments use Caddy for automatic HTTPS:
- Let&#039;s Encrypt certificates (auto-renewed)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Multi-Site Networking

When managing multiple UniFi sites, always use site-to-site VPN:

```
✅ RECOMMENDED: VPN Connection
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│  UI Toolkit      │◄──VPN──►│  Remote UniFi    │
│  Server          │         │  Controller      │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘

❌ AVOID: Direct Internet Exposure
Never expose UniFi controllers via port forwarding
```

**VPN Options:** UniFi Site-to-Site, WireGuard, Tailscale, IPSec

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can&#039;t connect to UniFi controller
- Set `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL=false` for self-signed certificates
- UniFi OS devices (UDM, UCG) require an API key, not username/password
- Verify network connectivity to controller

### Device not showing as online
- Wait 60 seconds for the next refresh cycle
- Verify MAC address format is correct
- Confirm device is connected in UniFi dashboard

### Let&#039;s Encrypt certificate fails
- Verify DNS A record points to your server
- Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open
- Check Caddy logs: `docker compose logs caddy`

### Rate limited on login
- Wait 5 minutes for lockout to expire
- Use `./reset_password.sh` if you forgot your password

### Docker issues
- Verify `.env` exists and contains `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Pull latest image: `docker compose pull &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d`

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. &lt;dfn title=&quot;also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense&quot;&gt;Completion&lt;/dfn&gt; everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenAPI&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as Swagger) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://json-schema.org/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JSON Schema&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;small&gt;* estimation based on tests conducted by an internal development team, building production applications.&lt;/small&gt;

## FastAPI mini documentary

There&#039;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpR8ngthqiE&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FastAPI mini documentary&lt;/a&gt; released at the end of 2025, you can watch it online:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpR8ngthqiE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/fastapi-documentary.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FastAPI Mini Documentary&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

## **Typer**, the FastAPI of CLIs

&lt;a href=&quot;https://typer.tiangolo.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://typer.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-margin-vector.svg&quot; style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

If you are building a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Command Line Interface&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/abbr&gt; app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://typer.tiangolo.com/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;**Typer**&lt;/a&gt;.

**Typer** is FastAPI&#039;s little sibling. And it&#039;s intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️ 🚀

## Requirements

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starlette.dev/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Starlette&lt;/a&gt; for the web parts.
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.pydantic.dev/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pydantic&lt;/a&gt; for the data parts.

## Installation

Create and activate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;virtual environment&lt;/a&gt; and then install FastAPI:

&lt;div class=&quot;termy&quot;&gt;

```console
$ pip install &quot;fastapi[standard]&quot;

---&gt; 100%
```

&lt;/div&gt;

**Note**: Make sure you put `&quot;fastapi[standard]&quot;` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.

## Example

### Create it

Create a file `main.py` with:

```Python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)
def read_root():
    return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}


@app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str | None = None):
    return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;: q}
```

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Or use &lt;code&gt;async def&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/summary&gt;

If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```Python hl_lines=&quot;7  12&quot;
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)
async def read_root():
    return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}


@app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str | None = None):
    return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;: q}
```

**Note**:

If you don&#039;t know, check the _&quot;In a hurry?&quot;_ section about &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;`async` and `await` in the docs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Run it

Run the server with:

&lt;div class=&quot;termy&quot;&gt;

```console
$ fastapi dev main.py

 ╭────────── FastAPI CLI - Development mode ───────────╮

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;About the command &lt;code&gt;fastapi dev main.py&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;/summary&gt;

The command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uvicorn.dev&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uvicorn&lt;/a&gt;.

By default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.

You can read more about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FastAPI CLI docs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Check it

Open your browser at &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery&lt;/a&gt;.

You will see the JSON response as:

```JSON
{&quot;item_id&quot;: 5, &quot;q&quot;: &quot;somequery&quot;}
```

You already created an API that:

* Receives HTTP requests in the _paths_ `/` and `/items/{item_id}`.
* Both _paths_ take `GET` &lt;em&gt;operations&lt;/em&gt; (also known as HTTP _methods_).
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has a _path parameter_ `item_id` that should be an `int`.
* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has an optional `str` _query parameter_ `q`.

### Interactive API docs

Now go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&lt;/a&gt;.

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Swagger UI&lt;/a&gt;):

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs

And now, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&lt;/a&gt;.

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ReDoc&lt;/a&gt;):

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

## Example upgrade

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```Python hl_lines=&quot;2  7-10 23-25&quot;
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: bool | None = None


@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)
def read_root():
    return {&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}


@app.get(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str | None = None):
    return {&quot;item_id&quot;: item_id, &quot;q&quot;: q}


@app.put(&quot;/items/{item_id}&quot;)
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {&quot;item_name&quot;: item.name, &quot;item_id&quot;: item_id}
```

The `fastapi dev` server should reload automatically.

### Interactive API docs upgrade

Now go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs&lt;/a&gt;.

* The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

* Click on the button &quot;Try it out&quot;, it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

* Then click on the &quot;Execute&quot; button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade

And now, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc&lt;/a&gt;.

* The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don&#039;t have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```Python
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```Python
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

* Editor support, including:
    * Completion.
    * Type checks.
* Validation of data:
    * Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.
* &lt;dfn title=&quot;also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling&quot;&gt;Conversion&lt;/dfn&gt; of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    * JSON.
    * Path parameters.
    * Query parameters.
    * Cookies.
    * Headers.
    * Forms.
    * Files.
* &lt;dfn title=&quot;also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling&quot;&gt;Conversion&lt;/dfn&gt; of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    * Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    * `datetime` objects.
    * `UUID` objects.
    * Database models.
    * ...and many more.
* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.

---

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

* Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
* Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
    * If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.
* Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
    * As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
    * Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).
* For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, read the body as JSON:
    * Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
    * Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
    * Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
    * All this would also work for deeply n

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings:
```

**Minimum required:**
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=my_claude_bot
APPROVED_DIRECTORY=/Users/yourname/projects
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789  # Your Telegram user ID
```

### 4. Run

```bash
make run          # Production
make run-debug    # With debug logging
```

Message your bot on Telegram to get started.

&gt; **Detailed setup:** See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for Claude authentication options and troubleshooting.

## Modes

The bot supports two interaction modes:

### Agentic Mode (Default)

The default conversational mode. Just talk to Claude naturally -- no special commands required.

**Commands:** `/start`, `/new`, `/status`, `/verbose`, `/repo`
If `ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true`: `/sync_threads`

```
You: What files are in this project?
Bot: Working... (3s)
     📖 Read
     📂 LS
     💬 Let me describe the project structure
Bot: [Claude describes the project structure]

You: Add a retry decorator to the HTTP client
Bot: Working... (8s)
     📖 Read: http_client.py
     💬 I&#039;ll add a retry decorator with exponential backoff
     ✏️ Edit: http_client.py
     💻 Bash: poetry run pytest tests/ -v
Bot: [Claude shows the changes and test results]

You: /verbose 0
Bot: Verbosity set to 0 (quiet)
```

Use `/verbose 0|1|2` to control how much background activity is shown:

| Level | Shows |
|-------|-------|
| **0** (quiet) | Final response only (typing indicator stays active) |
| **1** (normal, default) | Tool names + reasoning snippets in real-time |
| **2** (detailed) | Tool names with inputs + longer reasoning text |

#### GitHub Workflow

Claude Code already knows how to use `gh` CLI and `git`. Authenticate on your server with `gh auth login`, then work with repos conversationally:

```
You: List my repos related to monitoring
Bot: [Claude runs gh repo list, shows results]

You: Clone the uptime one
Bot: [Claude runs gh repo clone, clones into workspace]

You: /repo
Bot: 📦 uptime-monitor/  ◀
     📁 other-project/

You: Show me the open issues
Bot: [Claude runs gh issue list]

You: Create a fix branch and push it
Bot: [Claude creates branch, commits, pushes]
```

Use `/repo` to list cloned repos in your workspace, or `/repo &lt;name&gt;` to switch directories (sessions auto-resume).

### Classic Mode

Set `AGENTIC_MODE=false` to enable the full 13-command terminal-like interface with directory navigation, inline keyboards, quick actions, git integration, and session export.

**Commands:** `/start`, `/help`, `/new`, `/continue`, `/end`, `/status`, `/cd`, `/ls`, `/pwd`, `/projects`, `/export`, `/actions`, `/git`  
If `ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true`: `/sync_threads`

```
You: /cd my-web-app
Bot: Directory changed to my-web-app/

You: /ls
Bot: src/  tests/  package.json  README.md

You: /actions
Bot: [Run Tests] [Install Deps] [Format Code] [Run Linter]
```

## Event-Driven Automation

Beyond direct chat, the bot can respond to external triggers:

- **Webhooks** -- Receive GitHub events (push, PR, issues) and route them through Claude for automated summaries or code review
- **Scheduler** -- Run recurring Claude tasks on a cron schedule (e.g., daily code health checks)
- **Notifications** -- Deliver agent responses to configured Telegram chats

Enable with `ENABLE_API_SERVER=true` and `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true`. See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for configuration.

### Planned Enhancements

- Plugin system for third-party extensions

## Configuration

### Required

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...           # From @BotFather
TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=...        # Your bot&#039;s username
APPROVED_DIRECTORY=...           # Base directory for project access
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789          # Comma-separated Telegram user IDs
```

### Common Options

```bash
# Claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...     # API key (optional if using CLI auth)
CLAUDE_MAX_COST_PER_USER=10.0    # Spending limit per user (USD)
CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300       # Operation timeout

# Mode
AGENTIC_MODE=true                # Agentic (default) or classic mode
VERBOSE_LEVEL=1                  # 0=quiet, 1=normal (default), 2=detailed

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=10           # Requests per window
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60             # Window in seconds

# Features (classic mode)
ENABLE_GIT_INTEGRATION=true
ENABLE_FILE_UPLOADS=true
ENABLE_QUICK_ACTIONS=true
```

### Agentic Platform

```bash
# Webhook API Server
ENABLE_API_SERVER=false          # Enable FastAPI webhook server
API_SERVER_PORT=8080             # Server port

# Webhook Authentication
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...        # GitHub HMAC-SHA256 secret
WEBHOOK_API_SECRET=...           # Bearer token for generic providers

# Scheduler
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false           # Enable cron job scheduler

# Notifications
NOTIFICATION_CHAT_IDS=123,456    # Default chat IDs for proactive notifications
```

### Project Threads Mode

```bash
# Enable strict topic routing by project
ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true

# Mode: private (default) or group
PROJECT_THREADS_MODE=private

# YAML registry file (see config/projects.example.yaml)
PROJECTS_CONFIG_PATH=config/projects.yaml

# Required only when PROJECT_THREADS_MODE=group
PROJECT_THREADS_CHAT_ID=-1001234567890
```

In strict mode, only `/start` and `/sync_threads` work outside mapped project topics.
In private mode, `/start` auto-syncs project topics for your private bot chat.
To use topics with your bot, enable them in BotFather:
`Bot Settings -&gt; Threaded mode`.

&gt; **Full reference:** See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) and [`.env.example`](.env.example).

### Finding Your Telegram User ID

Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram -- it will reply with your user ID number.

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn&#039;t respond:**
- Check your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- Verify your user ID is in `ALLOWED_USERS`
- Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and accessible
- Check bot logs with `make run-debug`

**Claude integration not working:**
- SDK mode (default): Check `claude auth status` or verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- CLI mode: Verify `claude --version` and `claude auth status`
- Check `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS` includes necessary tools

**High usage costs:**
- Adjust `CLAUDE_MAX_COST_PER_USER` to set spending limits
- Monitor usage with `/status`
- Use shorter, more focused requests

## Security

This bot implements defense-in-depth security:

- **Access Control** -- Whitelist-based user authentication
- **Directory Isolation** -- Sandboxing to approved directories
- **Rate Limiting** -- Request and cost-based limits
- **Input Validation** -- Injection and path traversal protection
- **Webhook Authentication** -- GitHub HMAC-SHA256 and Bearer token verification
- **Audit Logging** -- Complete tracking of all user actions

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Development

```bash
make dev           # Install all dependencies
make test          # Run tests with coverage
make lint          # Black + isort + flake8 + mypy

## Release Process

ComfyUI follows a weekly release cycle targeting Monday but this regularly changes because of model releases or large changes to the codebase. There are three interconnected repositories:

1. **[ComfyUI Core](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**
   - Releases a new stable version (e.g., v0.7.0) roughly every week.
   - Starting from v0.4.0 patch versions will be used for fixes backported onto the current stable release.
   - Minor versions will be used for releases off the master branch.
   - Patch versions may still be used for releases on the master branch in cases where a backport would not make sense.
   - Commits outside of the stable release tags may be very unstable and break many custom nodes.
   - Serves as the foundation for the desktop release

2. **[ComfyUI Desktop](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop)**
   - Builds a new release using the latest stable core version

3. **[ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend)**
   - Weekly frontend updates are merged into the core repository
   - Features are frozen for the upcoming core release
   - Development continues for the next release cycle

# Installing

## Windows Portable

There is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).

### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)

Simply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) or with the windows explorer on recent windows versions and run. For smaller models you normally only need to put the checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints but many of the larger models have multiple files. Make sure to follow the instructions to know which subfolder to put them in ComfyUI\models\

If you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -&gt; properties -&gt; unblock

The portable above currently comes with python 3.13 and pytorch cuda 13.0. Update your Nvidia drivers if it doesn&#039;t start.

#### Alternative Downloads:

[Experimental portable for AMD GPUs](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_amd.7z)

[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.8 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu128.7z).

[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.6 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu126.7z) (Supports Nvidia 10 series and older GPUs).

#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?

See the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.


## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)

You can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:
```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy install
```

## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)

Python 3.14 works but some custom nodes may have issues. The free threaded variant works but some dependencies will enable the GIL so it&#039;s not fully supported.

Python 3.13 is very well supported. If you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13 you can try 3.12

torch 2.4 and above is supported but some features and optimizations might only work on newer versions. We generally recommend using the latest major version of pytorch with the latest cuda version unless it is less than 2 weeks old.

### Instructions:

Git clone this repo.

Put your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints

Put your VAE in: models/vae


### AMD GPUs (Linux)

AMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don&#039;t have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm7.1```

This is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 7.1 which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.1```


### AMD GPUs (Experimental: Windows and Linux), RDNA 3, 3.5 and 4 only.

These have less hardware support than the builds above but they work on windows. You also need to install the pytorch version specific to your hardware.

RDNA 3 (RX 7000 series):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx110X-all/```

RDNA 3.5 (Strix halo/Ryzen AI Max+ 365):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/```

RDNA 4 (RX 9000 series):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx120X-all/```

### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)

Intel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip. More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)

1. To install PyTorch xpu, use the following command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu```

This is the command to install the Pytorch xpu nightly which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```

### NVIDIA

Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130```

This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the &quot;Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled&quot; error, uninstall torch with:

```pip uninstall torch```

And install it again with the command above.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.

### Others:

#### Apple Mac silicon

You can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.

1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).
1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.
1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).
1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

&gt; **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discuss

## 🚀 快速开始

### 一、源码部署（推荐）

#### 前置要求

| 工具 | 版本要求 | 说明 | 安装检查 |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | 前端运行环境，包含 npm | `node -v` |
| **Python** | ≥3.11, ≤3.12 | 后端运行环境 | `python --version` |
| **uv** | 最新版 | Python 包管理器 | `uv --version` |

#### 1. 配置环境变量

```bash
# 复制示例配置文件
cp .env.example .env

# 编辑 .env 文件，填入必要的 API 密钥
```

**必需的环境变量：**

```env
# LLM API配置（支持 OpenAI SDK 格式的任意 LLM API）
# 推荐使用阿里百炼平台qwen-plus模型：https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/
# 注意消耗较大，可先进行小于40轮的模拟尝试
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
LLM_MODEL_NAME=qwen-plus

# Zep Cloud 配置
# 每月免费额度即可支撑简单使用：https://app.getzep.com/
ZEP_API_KEY=your_zep_api_key
```

#### 2. 安装依赖

```bash
# 一键安装所有依赖（根目录 + 前端 + 后端）
npm run setup:all
```

或者分步安装：

```bash
# 安装 Node 依赖（根目录 + 前端）
npm run setup

# 安装 Python 依赖（后端，自动创建虚拟环境）
npm run setup:backend
```

#### 3. 启动服务

```bash
# 同时启动前后端（在项目根目录执行）
npm run dev
```

**服务地址：**
- 前端：`http://localhost:3000`
- 后端 API：`http://localhost:5001`

**单独启动：**

```bash
npm run backend   # 仅启动后端
npm run frontend  # 仅启动前端
```

### 二、Docker 部署

```bash
# 1. 配置环境变量（同源码部署）
cp .env.example .env

# 2. 拉取镜像并启动
docker compose up -d
```

默认会读取根目录下的 `.env`，并映射端口 `3000（前端）/5001（后端）`

&gt; 在 `docker-compose.yml` 中已通过注释提供加速镜像地址，可按需替换

PaperQA2 is a package for doing high-accuracy retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on PDFs, text files, Microsoft Office documents, and source code files,
with a focus on the scientific literature.
See our [recent 2024 paper](https://paper.wikicrow.ai)
to see examples of PaperQA2&#039;s superhuman performance in scientific tasks like
question answering, summarization, and contradiction detection.

## Quickstart

In this example we take a folder of research paper PDFs,
magically get their metadata - including citation counts with a retraction check,
then parse and cache PDFs into a full-text search index,
and finally answer the user question with an LLM agent.

```bash
pip install paper-qa
mkdir my_papers
curl -o my_papers/PaperQA2.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13740
cd my_papers
pqa ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

### Example Output

Question: Has anyone designed neural networks that compute with proteins or DNA?

&gt; The claim that neural networks have been designed to compute with DNA is supported by multiple sources.
&gt; The work by Qian, Winfree, and Bruck demonstrates the use of DNA strand displacement cascades
&gt; to construct neural network components, such as artificial neurons and associative memories,
&gt; using a DNA-based system (Qian2011Neural pages 1-2, Qian2011Neural pages 15-16, Qian2011Neural pages 54-56).
&gt; This research includes the implementation of a 3-bit XOR gate and a four-neuron Hopfield associative memory,
&gt; showcasing the potential of DNA for neural network computation.
&gt; Additionally, the application of deep learning techniques to genomics,
&gt; which involves computing with DNA sequences, is well-documented.
&gt; Studies have applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict genomic features such as
&gt; transcription factor binding and DNA accessibility (Eraslan2019Deep pages 4-5, Eraslan2019Deep pages 5-6).
&gt; These models leverage DNA sequences as input data,
&gt; effectively using neural networks to compute with DNA.
&gt; While the provided excerpts do not explicitly mention protein-based neural network computation,
&gt; they do highlight the use of neural networks in tasks related to protein sequences,
&gt; such as predicting DNA-protein binding (Zeng2016Convolutional pages 1-2).
&gt; However, the primary focus remains on DNA-based computation.

## What is PaperQA2

PaperQA2 is engineered to be the best agentic RAG model for working with scientific papers.
Here are some features:

- A simple interface to get good answers with grounded responses containing in-text citations.
- State-of-the-art implementation including document metadata-awareness
  in embeddings and LLM-based re-ranking and contextual summarization (RCS).
- Support for agentic RAG, where a language agent can iteratively refine queries and answers.
- Automatic redundant fetching of paper metadata,
  including citation and journal quality data from multiple providers.
- A usable full-text search engine for a local repository of PDF/text files.
- A robust interface for customization, with default support for all [LiteLLM][LiteLLM providers] models.

[LiteLLM providers]: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers
[LiteLLM general docs]: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/

By default, it uses [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
and [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) with a Numpy vector DB to embed and search documents.
However, you can easily use other closed-source, open-source models or embeddings (see details below).

PaperQA2 depends on some awesome libraries/APIs that make our repo possible.
Here are some in no particular order:

1. [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
2. [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/)
3. [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/)
4. [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
5. [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy)
6. [LiteLLM][LiteLLM general docs]
7. [pybtex](https://pybtex.org/)

### PaperQA2 vs PaperQA

We&#039;ve been working hard on fundamental upgrades for a while
and mostly followed [SemVer](https://semver.org/), until [December 2025](#paperqa2-goes-calver-in-december-2025).
Meaning we&#039;ve incremented the major version number on each breaking change.
This brings us to the current major version number v5.
So why call is the repo now called PaperQA2?
We wanted to remark on the fact though that we&#039;ve
exceeded human performance on [many important metrics](https://paper.wikicrow.ai).
So we arbitrarily call version 5 and onward PaperQA2,
and versions before it as PaperQA1 to denote the significant change in performance.
We recognize that we are challenged at naming and counting at FutureHouse,
so we reserve the right at any time to arbitrarily change the name to PaperCrow.

### PaperQA2 Goes CalVer in December 2025

Prior to December 2025 we used [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
This eventually led to confusion in two ways:

1. Developers: should we major version bump based on
   settings or fundamental system capabilities?
   What if a bug fix requires breaking changes to the agent&#039;s behaviors?
2. Speaking: should one use terminology from our publications
   (e.g. [PaperQA1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07559),
   [PaperQA2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13740))
   or the Git tags (e.g. v5) from this repo/package?
   When someone says &quot;PaperQA&quot; -- what version do they mean?

To resolve these confusions, in December 2025,
we moved to [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/).
The developer burden is diminished because
we&#039;re basically removing guarantees of backwards compatibility across releases
(as CalVer is [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/) bound to dates).
It solves the &quot;speaking&quot; issue because Git tags are now
quite different from publication terminology (e.g. PaperQA2 vs `v2025.12.17`).
When someone says &quot;PaperQA&quot; it will just refer to the system,
not a particular snapshot of agentic behaviors.
When someone says &quot;PaperQA2&quot; it will refer to `paper-qa&gt;=5`,
which applies to both SemVer tags `v5.0.0` and the new CalVer tags `v2025.12.17`.

This switch is backwards compatible for version 5&#039;s SemVer,
as the year 2025 is strictly greater than major version 5.

### What&#039;s New in Version 5 (aka PaperQA2)?

Version 5 added:

- A CLI `pqa`
- Agentic workflows invoking tools for
  paper search, gathering evidence, and generating an answer
- Removed much of the statefulness from the `Docs` object
- A migration to LiteLLM for compatibility with many LLM providers
  as well as centralized rate limits and cost tracking
- A bundled set of configurations (read [this section here](#bundled-settings)))
  containing known-good hyperparameters

Note that `Docs` objects pickled from prior versions of `PaperQA` are incompatible with version 5,
and will need to be rebuilt.
Also, our minimum Python version was increased to Python 3.11.

### What&#039;s New in December 2025?

The last four months since version `5.29.1` have seen many changes:

- New modalities: tables, figures, non-English languages, math equations
- More and better readers
  - Two new _model-based_ PDF readers: [Docling](packages/paper-qa-docling)
    and [Nvidia nemotron-parse](packages/paper-qa-nemotron)
  - All PDF readers now can parse images and tables, report page numbers,
    support DPI
  - A reader for Microsoft Office data types
- Multimodal contextual summarization
  - Media objects are also passed to the `summary_llm` during creation
  - Media objects&#039; embedding space is enhanced using an `enrichment_llm` prompt
- Simpler and performant HTTP stack
  - Consolidation from `aiohttp` and `httpx` to just `httpx`
  - Integration with [`httpx-aiohttp`](https://github.com/karpetrosyan/httpx-aiohttp) for performance
- `Context` relevance is simplified and some assumptions were removed
- Many minor features such as
  retrying `Context` creation upon invalid JSON,
  compatibility with fall 2025&#039;s frontier LLMs,
  and improved prompt templates
- Multiple fixes in metadata processing via Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex,
  and metadata processing
  (e.g. incorrectly inferring identical document IDs for main text and SI)
- Completed the deprecations accrued over the past year

### PaperQA2 Algorithm

To understand PaperQA2, let&#039;s start with the pieces of the underlying algorithm.
The default workflow of PaperQA2 is as follows:

| Phase                  | PaperQA2 Actions                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Paper Search**    | - Get candidate papers from LLM-generated keyword query                   |
|                        | - Chunk, embed, and add candidate papers to state                         |
| **2. Gather Evidence** | - Embed query into vector                                                 |
|                        | - Rank top _k_ document chunks in current state                           |
|                        | - Create scored summary of each chunk in the context of the current query |
|                        | - Use LLM to re-score and select most relevant summaries                  |
| **3. Generate Answer** | - Put best summaries into prompt with context                             |
|                        | - Generate answer with prompt                                             |

The tools can be invoked in any order by a language agent.
For example, an LLM agent might do a narrow and broad search,
or using different phrasing for the gather evidence step from the generate answer step.

## Installation

For a non-development setup,
install PaperQA2 (aka version 5) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/paper-qa/).
Note version 5 requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
pip install paper-qa&gt;=5
```

For development setup,
please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

PaperQA2 uses an LLM to operate,
so you&#039;ll need to either set an appropriate [API key environment variable][LiteLLM providers]
(i.e. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`)
or set up an open source LLM server (i.e. using [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile).
Any LiteLLM compatible model can be configured to use with PaperQA2.

If you need to index a large set of papers (100+),
you will likely want an API key for both
[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/metadata-plus/metadata-plus-keys/)
and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key),
which will allow you to avoid hitting public rate limits using these metadata services.
Those can be exported as `CROSSREF_API_KEY` and `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` variables.

## CLI Usage

The fastest way to test PaperQA2 is via the CLI. First navigate to a directory with some papers and use the `pqa` cli:

```bash
pqa ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

You will see PaperQA2 index your local PDF files,
gathering the necessary metadata for each of them
(using [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)),
search over that index, then break the files into chunked evidence contexts,
rank them, and ultimately generate an answer.
The next time this directory is queried,
your index will already be built (save for any differences detected, like new added papers),
so it will skip the indexing and chunking steps.

All prior answers will be indexed and stored,
you can view them by querying via the `search` subcommand,
or access them yourself in your `PQA_HOME` directory,
which defaults to `~/.pqa/`.

```bash
pqa -i &#039;answers&#039; search &#039;ranking and contextual summarization&#039;
```

PaperQA2 is highly configurable, when running from the command line,
`pqa --help` shows all options and short descriptions.
For example to run with a higher temperature:

```bash
pqa --temperature 0.5 ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

You can view all settings with `pqa view`.
Another useful thing is to change to other templated settings - for example
`fast` is a setting that answers more quickly
and you can see it with `pqa -s fast view`

Maybe you have some new settings you want to save? You can do that with

```bash
pqa -s my_new_settings --temperature 0.5 --llm foo-bar-5 save
```

and then you can use it with

```bash
pqa -s my_new_settings ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

If you run `pqa` with a command which requires a new indexing,
say if you change the default chunk_size,
a new index will automatically be created for you.

```bash
pqa --parsing.chunk_size 5000 ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

You can also use `pqa` to do full-text search with use of LLMs view the search command.
For example, let&#039;s save the index from a directory and give it a name:

```bash
pqa -i nanomaterials index
```

Now I can search for papers about thermoelectrics:

```bash
pqa -i nanomaterials search thermoelectrics
```

or I can use the normal ask

```bash
pqa -i nanomaterials ask &#039;Are there nm scale features in thermoelectric materials?&#039;
```

Both the CLI and module have pre-configured settings based on prior performance and our publications,
they can be invoked as follows:

```bash
pqa --settings &lt;setting name&gt; \
    ask &#039;Are there nm scale features in thermoelectric materials?&#039;
```

### Bundled Settings

Inside [`src/paperqa/configs`](src/paperqa/configs) we bundle known useful settings:

| Setting Name | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| high_quality | Highly performant, relatively expensive (due to having `evidence_k` = 15) query using a `ToolSelector` agent.                |
| fast         | Setting to get answers cheaply and quickly.                                                                                  |
| wikicrow     | Setting to emulate the Wikipedia article writing used in our WikiCrow publication.                                           |
| contracrow   | Setting to find contradictions in papers, your query should be a claim that needs to be flagged as a contradiction (or not). |
| debug        | Setting useful solely for debugging, but not in any actual application beyond debugging.                                     |
| tier1_limits | Settings that match OpenAI rate limits for each tier, you can use `tier&lt;1-5&gt;_limits` to specify the tier.                    |

### Rate Limits

If you are hitting rate limits, say with the OpenAI Tier 1 plan, you can add them into PaperQA2.
For each OpenAI tier, a pre-built setting exists to limit usage.

```bash
pqa --settings &#039;tier1_limits&#039; ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

This will limit your system to use the [tier1_limits](src/paperqa/configs/tier1_limits.json),
and slow down your queries to accommodate.

You can also specify them manually with any rate limit string that matches the specification in
the [limits](https://limits.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#rate-limit-string-notation) module:

```bash
pqa --summary_llm_config &#039;{&quot;rate_limit&quot;: {&quot;gpt-4o-2024-11-20&quot;: &quot;30000 per 1 minute&quot;}}&#039; \
    ask &#039;What is PaperQA2?&#039;
```

Or by adding into a `Settings` object, if calling imperatively:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    &quot;What is PaperQA2?&quot;,
    settings=Settings(
        llm_config={&quot;rate_limit&quot;: {&quot;gpt-4o-2024-11-20&quot;: &quot;30000 per 1 minute&quot;}},
        summary_llm_config={&quot;rate_limit&quot;: {&quot;gpt-4o-2024-11-20&quot;: &quot;30000 per 1 minute&quot;}},
    ),
)
```

## Library Usage

PaperQA2&#039;s full workflow can be accessed via Python directly:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    &quot;What is PaperQA2?&quot;,
    settings=Settings(temperature=0.5, paper_directory=&quot;my_papers&quot;),
)
```

Please see our [installation docs](#installation) for how to install the package from PyPI.

### Agentic Adding/Querying Documents

The answer object has the following attributes:
`formatted_answer`, `answer` (answer alone), `question` , and `context` (the summaries of passages found for answer).
`ask` will use the `SearchPapers` tool, which will query a local index of files,
you can specify this location via the `Settings` object:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, ask

answer_response = ask(
    &quot;What is PaperQA2?&quot;,
    settings=Settings(
        temperature=0.5, agent={&quot;index&quot;: {&quot;paper_directory&quot;: &quot;my_papers&quot;}}
    ),
)
```

`ask` is just a convenience wrapper around the real entrypoint,
which can be accessed if you&#039;d like to run concurrent asynchronous workloads:

```python
from paperqa import Settings, agent_query

answer_response = await agent_query(
    query=&quot;What is PaperQA2?&quot;,
    settings=Settings(
        temperature=0.5, agent={&quot;index&quot;: {&quot;paper_directory&quot;: &quot;my_papers&quot;}}
    ),
)
```

The default agent will use an LLM based agent,
but you can also specify a `&quot;fake&quot;` agent to use a hard coded call path of
search -&gt; gather evidence -&gt; answer to reduce token usage.

### Manual (No Agent) Adding/Querying Documents

Normally via agent execution, the agent invokes the search tool,
which adds documents to the `Docs` object for you behind the scenes.
However, if you prefer fine-grained control,
you can directly interact with the `Docs` object.

Note that manually adding and querying `Docs` does not impact performance.
It just removes the automation associated with a
