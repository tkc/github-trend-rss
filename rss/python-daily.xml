## A personal, organic agentic framework that grows and learns with you

- Agent Zero is not a predefined agentic framework. It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it.
- Agent Zero is fully transparent, readable, comprehensible, customizable, and interactive.
- Agent Zero uses the computer as a tool to accomplish its (your) tasks.

# üí° Key Features

1. **General-purpose Assistant**

- Agent Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.
- It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.

![Agent 0 Working](/docs/res/ui-screen-2.png)

2. **Computer as a Tool**

- Agent Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.
- The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.
- Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.
- **Default Tools:** Agent Zero includes tools like knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.
- **Creating Custom Tools:** Extend Agent Zero&#039;s functionality by creating your own custom tools.
- **Instruments:** Instruments are a new type of tool that allow you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Agent Zero.

3. **Multi-agent Cooperation**

- Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.
- In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.
- Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.

![Multi-agent](docs/res/physics.png)
![Multi-agent 2](docs/res/physics-2.png)

4. **Completely Customizable and Extensible**

- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.
- The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the **prompts/default/agent.system.md** file. Change this prompt and change the framework dramatically.
- The framework does not guide or limit the agent in any way. There are no hard-coded rails that agents have to follow.
- Every prompt, every small message template sent to the agent in its communication loop can be found in the **prompts/** folder and changed.
- Every default tool can be found in the **python/tools/** folder and changed or copied to create new predefined tools.

![Prompts](/docs/res/prompts.png)

5. **Communication is Key**

- Give your agent a proper system prompt and instructions, and it can do miracles.
- Agents can communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance. Instruct your agents in the system prompt on how to communicate effectively.
- The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive. You can stop and intervene at any point. If you see your agent heading in the wrong direction, just stop and tell it right away.
- There is a lot of freedom in this framework. You can instruct your agents to regularly report back to superiors asking for permission to continue. You can instruct them to use point-scoring systems when deciding when to delegate subtasks. Superiors can double-check subordinates&#039; results and dispute. The possibilities are endless.

## üöÄ Things you can build with Agent Zero

- **Development Projects** - `&quot;Create a React dashboard with real-time data visualization&quot;`

- **Data Analysis** - `&quot;Analyze last quarter&#039;s NVIDIA sales data and create trend reports&quot;`

- **Content Creation** - `&quot;Write a technical blog post about microservices&quot;`

- **System Admin** - `&quot;Set up a monitoring system for our web servers&quot;`

- **Research** - `&quot;Gather and summarize five recent AI papers about CoT prompting&quot;`

# Hacking Edition
- Agent Zero also offers a Hacking Edition based on Kali linux with modified prompts for cybersecurity tasks
- The setup is the same as the regular version, just use the frdel/agent-zero-run:hacking image instead of frdel/agent-zero-run


# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Click to open a video to learn how to install Agent Zero:

[![Easy Installation guide](/docs/res/easy_ins_vid.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1_peV8szf8)

A detailed setup guide for Windows, macOS, and Linux with a video can be found in the Agent Zero Documentation at [this page](./docs/installation.md).

### ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Pull and run with Docker

docker pull frdel/agent-zero-run
docker run -p 50001:80 frdel/agent-zero-run

# Visit http://localhost:50001 to start
```

## üê≥ Fully Dockerized, with Speech-to-Text and TTS

![Settings](docs/res/settings-page-ui.png)

- Customizable settings allow users to tailor the agent&#039;s behavior and responses to their needs.
- The Web UI output is very clean, fluid, colorful, readable, and interactive; nothing is hidden.
- You can load or save chats directly within the Web UI.
- The same output you see in the terminal is automatically saved to an HTML file in **logs/** folder for every session.

![Time example](/docs/res/time_example.jpg)

- Agent output is streamed in real-time, allowing users to read along and intervene at any time.
- No coding is required; only prompting and communication skills are necessary.
- With a solid system prompt, the framework is reliable even with small models, including precise tool usage.

## üëÄ Keep in Mind

1. **Agent Zero Can Be Dangerous!**

- With proper instruction, Agent Zero is capable of many things, even potentially dangerous actions concerning your computer, data, or accounts. Always run Agent Zero in an isolated environment (like Docker) and be careful what you wish for.

2. **Agent Zero Is Prompt-based.**

- The whole framework is guided by the **prompts/** folder. Agent guidelines, tool instructions, messages, utility AI functions, it&#039;s all there.

## Study guide

&gt; Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).

![Imgur](images/OfVllex.png)

**Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?**

**A: No, you don&#039;t need to know everything here to prepare for the interview**.

What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

* How much experience you have
* What your technical background is
* What positions you are interviewing for
* Which companies you are interviewing with
* Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.

Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.
* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.
* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.

## How to approach a system design interview question

&gt; How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions

Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

### Step 2: Create a high level design

Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations

You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)

## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you&#039;ll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](https://web.archive.org/web/20221030091841/http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](https://web.archive.org/web/20220530193911/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602114024/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126233752/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](https://web.archive.org/web/20220926171507/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we&#039;ll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we&#039;ll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.

## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjcY_00U1w)

## Motivation ü§î

These videos on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram get MILLIONS of views across all platforms and require very little effort.
The only original thing being done is the editing and gathering of all materials...

... but what if we can automate that process? ü§î

## Disclaimers üö®

- **At the moment**, this repository won&#039;t attempt to upload this content through this bot. It will give you a file that
  you will then have to upload manually. This is for the sake of avoiding any sort of community guideline issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Playwright (this should install automatically in installation)

## Installation üë©‚Äçüíª

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python -m playwright install` and `python -m playwright install-deps`

**EXPERIMENTAL!!!!**

On macOS and Linux (debian, arch, fedora and centos, and based on those), you can run an install script that will automatically install steps 1 to 3. (requires bash)

`bash &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/master/install.sh)`

This can also be used to update the installation

4. Run `python main.py`
5. Visit [the Reddit Apps page.](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps), and set up an app that is a &quot;script&quot;. Paste any URL in redirect URL. Ex:`https://jasoncameron.dev`
6. The bot will ask you to fill in your details to connect to the Reddit API, and configure the bot to your liking
7. Enjoy üòé
8. If you need to reconfigure the bot, simply open the `config.toml` file and delete the lines that need to be changed. On the next run of the bot, it will help you reconfigure those options.

(Note if you got an error installing or running the bot try first rerunning the command with a three after the name e.g. python3 or pip3)

If you want to read more detailed guide about the bot, please refer to the [documentation](https://reddit-video-maker-bot.netlify.app/)

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Self-hosted AI Package

**Self-hosted AI Package** is an open, docker compose template that
quickly bootstraps a fully featured Local AI and Low Code development
environment including Ollama for your local LLMs, Open WebUI for an interface to chat with your N8N agents, and Supabase for your database, vector store, and authentication. 

This is Cole&#039;s version with a couple of improvements and the addition of Supabase, Open WebUI, Flowise, Neo4j, Langfuse, SearXNG, and Caddy!
Also, the local RAG AI Agent workflows from the video will be automatically in your 
n8n instance if you use this setup instead of the base one provided by n8n!

## Important Links

Curated by &lt;https://github.com/n8n-io&gt; and &lt;https://github.com/coleam00&gt;, it combines the self-hosted n8n
platform with a curated list of compatible AI products and components to
quickly get started with building self-hosted AI workflows.

### What‚Äôs included

‚úÖ [**Self-hosted n8n**](https://n8n.io/) - Low-code platform with over 400
integrations and advanced AI components

‚úÖ [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) - Open source database as a service -
most widely used database for AI agents

‚úÖ [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) - Cross-platform LLM platform to install
and run the latest local LLMs

‚úÖ [**Open WebUI**](https://openwebui.com/) - ChatGPT-like interface to
privately interact with your local models and N8N agents

‚úÖ [**Flowise**](https://flowiseai.com/) - No/low code AI agent
builder that pairs very well with n8n

‚úÖ [**Qdrant**](https://qdrant.tech/) - Open source, high performance vector
store with an comprehensive API. Even though you can use Supabase for RAG, this was
kept unlike Postgres since it&#039;s faster than Supabase so sometimes is the better option.

‚úÖ [**Neo4j**](https://neo4j.com/) - Knowledge graph engine that powers tools like GraphRAG, LightRAG, and Graphiti 

‚úÖ [**SearXNG**](https://searxng.org/) - Open source, free internet metasearch engine which aggregates 
results from up to 229 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled, hence the fit with the local AI package.

‚úÖ [**Caddy**](https://caddyserver.com/) - Managed HTTPS/TLS for custom domains

‚úÖ [**Langfuse**](https://langfuse.com/) - Open source LLM engineering platform for agent observability

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Required to run the setup script
- [Git/GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - For easy repository management
- [Docker/Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - Required to run all services

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone -b stable https://github.com/coleam00/local-ai-packaged.git
cd local-ai-packaged
```

Before running the services, you need to set up your environment variables for Supabase following their [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#securing-your-services).

1. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` in the root directory of the project
2. Set the following required environment variables:
   ```bash
   ############
   # N8N Configuration
   ############
   N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
   N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_JWT_SECRET=

   ############
   # Supabase Secrets
   ############
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
   JWT_SECRET=
   ANON_KEY=
   SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
   DASHBOARD_USERNAME=
   DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=
   POOLER_TENANT_ID=

   ############
   # Neo4j Secrets
   ############   
   NEO4J_AUTH=

   ############
   # Langfuse credentials
   ############

   CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=
   MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=
   LANGFUSE_SALT=
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=  
   ```

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Make sure to generate secure random values for all secrets. Never use the example values in production.

3. Set the following environment variables if deploying to production, otherwise leave commented:
   ```bash
   ############
   # Caddy Config
   ############

   N8N_HOSTNAME=n8n.yourdomain.com
   WEBUI_HOSTNAME=:openwebui.yourdomain.com
   FLOWISE_HOSTNAME=:flowise.yourdomain.com
   SUPABASE_HOSTNAME=:supabase.yourdomain.com
   OLLAMA_HOSTNAME=:ollama.yourdomain.com
   SEARXNG_HOSTNAME=searxng.yourdomain.com
   NEO4J_HOSTNAME=neo4j.yourdomain.com
   LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your-email-address
   ```   

---

The project includes a `start_services.py` script that handles starting both the Supabase and local AI services. The script accepts a `--profile` flag to specify which GPU configuration to use.

### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
&gt; [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
python start_services.py --profile gpu-amd
```

### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you&#039;re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can&#039;t expose your GPU to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU:
   ```bash
   python start_services.py --profile cpu
   ```

2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the n8n instance:
   ```bash
   python start_services.py --profile none
   ```

   If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the [Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/) for installation instructions.

#### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you&#039;re running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &amp;service-n8n
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see &quot;Editor is now accessible via: http://localhost:5678/&quot;:

1. Head to http://localhost:5678/home/credentials
2. Click on &quot;Local Ollama service&quot;
3. Change the base URL to &quot;http://host.docker.internal:11434/&quot;

### For everyone else

```bash
python start_services.py --profile cpu
```

### The environment argument
The **start-services.py** script offers the possibility to pass one of two options for the environment argument, **private** (default environment) and **public**:
- **private:** you are deploying the stack in a safe environment, hence a lot of ports can be made accessible without having to worry about security
- **public:** the stack is deployed in a public environment, which means the attack surface should be made as small as possible. All ports except for 80 and 443 are closed

The stack initialized with
```bash
   python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia --environment private
   ```
equals the one initialized with
```bash
   python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia
   ```

## Deploying to the Cloud

### Prerequisites for the below steps

- Linux machine (preferably Unbuntu) with Nano, Git, and Docker installed

### Extra steps

Before running the above commands to pull the repo and install everything:

1. Run the commands as root to open up the necessary ports:
   - ufw enable
   - ufw allow 80 &amp;&amp; ufw allow 443
   - ufw reload
   ---
   **WARNING**

   ufw does not shield ports published by docker, because the iptables rules configured by docker are analyzed before those configured by ufw. There is a solution to change this behavior, but that is out of scope for this project. Just make sure that all traffic runs through the caddy service via port 443. Port 80 should only be used to redirect to port 443.

   ---
2. Run the **start-services.py** script with the environment argument **public** to indicate you are going to run the package in a public environment. The script will make sure that all ports, except for 80 and 443, are closed down, e.g.

```bash
   python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia --environment public
   ```

3. Set up A records for your DNS provider to point your subdomains you&#039;ll set up in the .env file for Caddy
to the IP address of your cloud instance.

   For example, A record to point n8n to [cloud instance IP] for n8n.yourdomain.com

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The main component of the self-hosted AI starter kit is a docker compose file
pre-configured with network and disk so there isn‚Äôt much else you need to
install. After completing the installation steps above, follow the steps below
to get started.

1. Open &lt;http://localhost:5678/&gt; in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with n8n in the setup here,
   it is only a local account for your instance!
2. Open the included workflow:
   &lt;http://localhost:5678/workflow/vTN9y2dLXqTiDfPT&gt;
3. Create credentials for every service:
   
   Ollama URL: http://ollama:11434

   Postgres (through Supabase): use DB, username, and password from .env. IMPORTANT: Host is &#039;db&#039;
   Since that is the name of the service running Supabase

   Qdrant URL: http://qdrant:6333 (API key can be whatever since this is running locally)

   Google Drive: Follow [this guide from n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
   Don&#039;t use localhost for the redirect URI, just use another domain you have, it will still work!
   Alternatively, you can set up [local file triggers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).
4. Select **Test workflow** to start running the workflow.
5. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.1. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.
6. Make sure to toggle the workflow as active and copy the &quot;Production&quot; webhook URL!
7. Open &lt;http://localhost:3000/&gt; in your browser to set up Open WebUI.
You‚Äôll only have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with Open WebUI in the 
setup here, it is only a local account for your instance!
8. Go to Workspace -&gt; Functions -&gt; Add Function -&gt; Give name + description then paste in
the code from `n8n_pipe.py`

   The function is also [published here on Open WebUI&#039;s site](https://openwebui.com/f/coleam/n8n_pipe/).

9. Click on the gear icon and set the n8n_url to the production URL for the webhook
you copied in a previous step.
10. Toggle the function on and now it will be available in your model dropdown in the top left! 

To open n8n at any time, visit &lt;http://localhost:5678/&gt; in your browser.
To open Open WebUI at any time, visit &lt;http://localhost:3000/&gt;.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
&gt; workflows. While it‚Äôs not fully optimized for production environments, it
&gt; combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
&gt; projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Upgrading

To update all containers to their latest versions (n8n, Open WebUI, etc.), run these commands:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml --profile &lt;your-profile&gt; down

# Pull latest versions of all containers
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml --profile &lt;your-profile&gt; pull

# Start services again with your desired profile
python start_services.py --profile &lt;your-profile&gt;
```

Replace `&lt;your-profile&gt;` with one of: `cpu`, `gpu-nvidia`, `gpu-amd`, or `none`.

Note: The `start_services.py` script itself does not update containers - it only restarts them or pulls them if you are downloading these containers for the first time. To get the latest versions, you must explicitly run the commands above.

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter:

### Supabase Issues

- **Supabase Pooler Restarting**: If the supabase-pooler container keeps restarting itself, follow the instructions in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/30210#issuecomment-2456955578).

- **Supabase Analytics Startup Failure**: If the supabase-analytics container fails to start after changing your Postgres password, delete the folder `supabase/docker/volumes/db/data`.

- **If using Docker Desktop**: Go into the Docker settings and make sure &quot;Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS&quot; is turned on

- **Supabase Service Unavailable** - Make sure you don&#039;t have an &quot;@&quot; character in your Postgres password! If the connection to the kong container is working (the container logs say it is receiving requests from n8n) but n8n says it cannot connect, this is generally the problem from what the community has shared. Other characters might not be allowed too, the @ symbol is just the one I know for sure!

### GPU Support Issues

- **Windows GPU Support**: If you&#039;re having trouble running Ollama with GPU support on Windows with Docker Desktop:
  1. Open Docker Desktop settings
  2. Enable WSL 2 backend
  3. See the [Docker GPU documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/gpu/) for more details

- **Linux GPU Support**: If you&#039;re having trouble running Ollama with GPU support on Linux, follow the [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

## Tips &amp; tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.

## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader&#039;s design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic ‚Äî  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular
adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png &quot;nautilus-trader&quot;)

## Features

- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.
- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.
- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.
- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.
- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.
- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.
- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.
- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).

![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png &quot;nautilus&quot;)

&gt; *nautilus - from ancient Greek &#039;sailor&#039; and naus &#039;ship&#039;.*
&gt;
&gt; *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
&gt; The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.
- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.
- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).
This means we&#039;re using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.
It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.
Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

developer/user communities.
However, Python has performance and typing limitations for large-scale, latency-sensitive systems. Cython addresses many of these issues by introducing static typing into Python&#039;s rich ecosystem of libraries and communities.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is &quot;blazingly fast&quot; and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.
It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.

Rust‚Äôs rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically ‚Äî
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)‚Äîno Rust toolchain is required at install time.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

&gt; ‚ÄúThe intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
&gt; The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.‚Äù

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
&gt; As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues
and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

## Versioning and releases

**NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while
the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.
We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).
&gt; Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
&gt; This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),
which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.

- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
&gt; On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
&gt; For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = &quot;*&quot;, features = [&quot;high-precision&quot;] }
```

## Installation

We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2. Build from source.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a &quot;vanilla&quot; CPython.
&gt;
&gt; Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren‚Äôt officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python&#039;s pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) is [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) compliant and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ‚úì       | ‚úì       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ‚úì       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ‚úì       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | ‚úì       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt;
&gt; We don&#039;t recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation commands

By default, pip installs the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP &#039;(?&lt;=&lt;a href=&quot;)[^&quot;]+(?=&quot;)&#039; | awk -F&#039;#&#039; &#039;{print $1}&#039; | sort
```

#### Branch updates

- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Are built and published continuously with every merged commit.
- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Are built and published daily when `develop` branch is automatic

### Modified Assistive Driving Safety (MADS)
The goal of Modified Assistive Driving Safety (MADS) is to enhance the user driving experience with modified behaviors of driving assist engagements. This feature complies with comma.ai&#039;s safety rules as accurately as possible with the following changes:
* sunnypilot Automatic Lane Centering (ALC) and ACC/SCC can be engaged independently of each other
* Dedicated button to toggle sunnypilot ALC:
    * `CRUISE (MAIN)` button: All supported cars on sunnypilot
        * `LFA` button: Newer HKG cars with `LFA` button
        * `LKAS` button: Honda, Toyota, Global Subaru
* `SET-` button enables ACC/SCC
* `CANCEL` button only disables ACC/SCC
* `CRUISE (MAIN)` must be `ON` to use ACC/SCC
* `CRUISE (MAIN)` button disables sunnypilot completely when `OFF` **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**

### Disengage Lateral ALC on Brake Press Mode toggle
Dedicated toggle to handle Lateral state on brake pedal press and release:
1. `ON`: `BRAKE pedal` press will pause Automatic Lane Centering; `BRAKE pedal` release will resume Automatic Lane Centering. Note: `BRAKE pedal` release will NOT resume ACC/SCC/Long control without explicit user engagement **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**
2. `OFF`: `BRAKE pedal` press will NOT pause Automatic Lane Centering; `BRAKE pedal` release will NOT resume ACC/SCC/Long control without explicit user engagement **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**

### Miscellaneous
* `TURN SIGNALS` (`Left` or `Right`) will pause Automatic Lane Centering if the vehicle speed is below the [threshold](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/selfdrive/controls/lib/desire_helper.py#L8) for Automatic Lane Change
* Event audible alerts are more relaxed to match manufacturer&#039;s stock behavior
* Critical events trigger disengagement of Automatic Lane Centering completely. The disengagement is enforced in sunnypilot and panda safety

### Dynamic Lane Profile (DLP)

Dynamic Lane Profile (DLP) aims to provide the best driving experience at staying within a lane confidently. Dynamic Lane Profile allows sunnypilot to dynamically switch between lane profiles based on lane recognition confidence level on road.

There are 3 modes to select on the onroad camera screen:
* **Auto Lane**: sunnypilot dynamically chooses between `Laneline` or `Laneless` model
* **Laneline**: sunnypilot uses Laneline model only.
* **Laneless**: sunnypilot uses Laneless model only.

To use Dynamic Lane Profile, do the following:
```
1. sunnypilot Settings -&gt; `SP - Controls` -&gt; Enable Dynamic Lane Profile -&gt; ON toggle
2. Reboot.
3. Before driving, on the onroad camera screen, toggle between the 3 modes by pressing on the button.
4. Drive.
```

### Enhanced Speed Control
This fork now allows supported cars to dynamically adjust the longitudinal plan based on the fetched map data. Big thanks to the Move Fast team for the amazing implementation!

**Supported cars:**
* sunnypilot Longitudinal Control capable
* Stock Longitudinal Control
    * Hyundai/Kia/Genesis (non CAN-FD)
    * Honda Bosch
    * Volkswagen MQB

Certain features are only available with an active data connection, via:
* [comma Prime](https://comma.ai/prime) - Intuitive service provided directly by comma, or
* Personal Hotspot - From your mobile device, or a dedicated hotspot from a cellular carrier.

**Features:**
* Vision-based Turn Speed Control (VTSC) - Use vision path predictions to estimate the appropriate speed to drive through turns ahead - i.e. slowing down for curves
* Map-Data-based Turn Speed Control (MTSC) - Use curvature information from map data to define speed limits to take turns ahead - i.e. slowing down for curves[^1]
* Speed Limit Control (SLC) - Use speed limit signs information from map data and car interface to automatically adapt cruise speed to road limits
    * HKG only: Highway Driving Assist (HDA) status integration - on applicable HKG cars only[^1]
    * Speed Limit Offset - When Speed Limit Control is enabled, set speed limit slightly higher than the actual speed limit for a more natural drive[^1]
* Toggle Hands on Wheel Monitoring - Monitors and alerts the driver when their hands have not been on the steering wheel for an extended time

### Custom Stock Longitudinal Control
While using stock Adaptive/Smart Cruise Control, Custom Stock Longitudinal Control in sunnypilot allows sunnypilot to manipulate and take over the set speed on the car&#039;s dashboard.

**Supported Cars:**
* Hyundai/Kia/Genesis
    * CAN platform
    * CAN-FD platform with 0x1CF broadcasted in CAN traffic
* Honda Bosch
* Volkswagen MQB

**Instruction**

**üìó How to use Custom Longitudinal Control on sunnypilot **

When using Speed Limit, Vision, or Map based Turn control, you will be setting the &quot;MAX&quot; ACC speed on the sunnypilot display instead of the one in the dashboard. The car will then set the ACC setting in the dashboard to the targeted speed, but will never exceed the max speed set on the sunnypilot display. A quick press of the RES+ or SET- buttons will change this speed by 5 MPH or KM/H on the sunnypilot display, while a long deliberate press (about a 1/2 second press) changes it by 1 MPH or KM/H. DO NOT hold the RES+ or SET- buttons for longer that a 1 second. Either make quick or long deliberate presses only.

**‚Äº Where to look when setting ACC speed ‚Äº**

Do not look at the dashboard when setting your ACC max speed. Instead, only look at the one on the sunnypilot display, &quot;MAX&quot;. The reason you need to look at the sunnypilot display is because sunnypilot will be changing the one in the dashboard. It will be adjusting it as needed, never raising it above the one set on the sunnypilot display. ONLY look at the MAX speed on the sunnypilot display when setting the ACC speed instead of the dashboard!

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Check out the new [MCP server for Graphiti](mcp_server/README.md)! Give Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients powerful Knowledge Graph-based memory.

Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically tailored for AI agents operating in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti continuously integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph. The framework supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without requiring complete graph recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI applications.

Use Graphiti to:

- Integrate and maintain dynamic user interactions and business data.
- Facilitate state-based reasoning and task automation for agents.
- Query complex, evolving data with semantic, keyword, and graph-based search methods.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;images/graphiti-graph-intro.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Graphiti temporal walkthrough&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot;&gt;   
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected facts, such as _&quot;Kendra loves Adidas shoes.&quot;_ Each fact is a &quot;triplet&quot; represented by two entities, or
nodes (&quot;Kendra&quot;, &quot;Adidas shoes&quot;), and their relationship, or edge (&quot;loves&quot;). Knowledge Graphs have been explored
extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph
while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context.

## Graphiti and Zep Memory

Graphiti powers the core of [Zep&#039;s memory layer](https://www.getzep.com) for AI Agents.

Using Graphiti, we&#039;ve demonstrated Zep is
the [State of the Art in Agent Memory](https://blog.getzep.com/state-of-the-art-agent-memory/).

Read our paper: [Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956).

We&#039;re excited to open-source Graphiti, believing its potential reaches far beyond AI memory applications.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/arxiv-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Why Graphiti?

Traditional RAG approaches often rely on batch processing and static data summarization, making them inefficient for frequently changing data. Graphiti addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Real-Time Incremental Updates:** Immediate integration of new data episodes without batch recomputation.
- **Bi-Temporal Data Model:** Explicit tracking of event occurrence and ingestion times, allowing accurate point-in-time queries.
- **Efficient Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic embeddings, keyword (BM25), and graph traversal to achieve low-latency queries without reliance on LLM summarization.
- **Custom Entity Definitions:** Flexible ontology creation and support for developer-defined entities through straightforward Pydantic models.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently manages large datasets with parallel processing, suitable for enterprise environments.

Graphiti is specifically designed to address the challenges of dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time interaction and precise historical queries.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j 5.26 or higher (serves as the embeddings storage backend)
- OpenAI API key (for LLM inference and embedding)

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Graphiti works best with LLM services that support Structured Output (such as OpenAI and Gemini).
&gt; Using other services may result in incorrect output schemas and ingestion failures. This is particularly
&gt; problematic when using smaller models.

Optional:

- Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq API key (for alternative LLM providers)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; The simplest way to install Neo4j is via [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/). It provides a user-friendly
&gt; interface to manage Neo4j instances and databases.

```bash
pip install graphiti-core
```

or

```bash
poetry add graphiti-core
```

You can also install optional LLM providers as extras:

```bash
# Install with Anthropic support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic]

# Install with Groq support
pip install graphiti-core[groq]

# Install with Google Gemini support
pip install graphiti-core[google-genai]

# Install with multiple providers
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic,groq,google-genai]
```

## Quick Start

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Graphiti uses OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding. Ensure that an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment.
&gt; Support for Anthropic and Groq LLM inferences is available, too. Other LLM providers may be supported via OpenAI
&gt; compatible APIs.

For a complete working example, see the [Quickstart Example](./examples/quickstart/README.md) in the examples directory. The quickstart demonstrates:

1. Connecting to a Neo4j database
2. Initializing Graphiti indices and constraints
3. Adding episodes to the graph (both text and structured JSON)
4. Searching for relationships (edges) using hybrid search
5. Reranking search results using graph distance
6. Searching for nodes using predefined search recipes

The example is fully documented with clear explanations of each functionality and includes a comprehensive README with setup instructions and next steps.

## MCP Server

The `mcp_server` directory contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Graphiti. This server allows AI assistants to interact with Graphiti&#039;s knowledge graph capabilities through the MCP protocol.

Key features of the MCP server include:

- Episode management (add, retrieve, delete)
- Entity management and relationship handling
- Semantic and hybrid search capabilities
- Group management for organizing related data
- Graph maintenance operations

The MCP server can be deployed using Docker with Neo4j, making it easy to integrate Graphiti into your AI assistant workflows.

For detailed setup instructions and usage examples, see the [MCP server README](./mcp_server/README.md).

## REST Service

The `server` directory contains an API service for interacting with the Graphiti API. It is built using FastAPI.

Please see the [server README](./server/README.md) for more information.

## Optional Environment Variables

In addition to the Neo4j and OpenAi-compatible credentials, Graphiti also has a few optional environment variables.
If you are using one of our supported models, such as Anthropic or Voyage models, the necessary environment variables
must be set.

`USE_PARALLEL_RUNTIME` is an optional boolean variable that can be set to true if you wish
to enable Neo4j&#039;s parallel runtime feature for several of our search queries.
Note that this feature is not supported for Neo4j Community edition or for smaller AuraDB instances,
as such this feature is off by default.

## Using Graphiti with Azure OpenAI

Graphiti supports Azure OpenAI for both LLM inference and embeddings. To use Azure OpenAI, you&#039;ll need to configure both the LLM client and embedder with your Azure OpenAI credentials.

```python
from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client import OpenAIClient
from graphiti_core.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder, OpenAIEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.openai_reranker_client import OpenAIRerankerClient

# Azure OpenAI configuration
api_key = &quot;&lt;your-api-key&gt;&quot;
api_version = &quot;&lt;your-api-version&gt;&quot;
azure_endpoint = &quot;&lt;your-azure-endpoint&gt;&quot;

# Create Azure OpenAI client for LLM
azure_openai_client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
    api_key=api_key,
    api_version=api_version,
    azure_endpoint=azure_endpoint
)

# Initialize Graphiti with Azure OpenAI clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    &quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    &quot;neo4j&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;,
    llm_client=OpenAIClient(
        client=azure_openai_client
    ),
    embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(
        config=OpenAIEmbedderConfig(
            embedding_model=&quot;text-embedding-3-small&quot;  # Use your Azure deployed embedding model name
        ),
        client=azure_openai_client
    ),
    # Optional: Configure the OpenAI cross encoder with Azure OpenAI
    cross_encoder=OpenAIRerankerClient(
        client=azure_openai_client
    )
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Azure OpenAI
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials and specify the correct embedding model name that&#039;s deployed in your Azure OpenAI service.

## Using Graphiti with Google Gemini

Graphiti supports Google&#039;s Gemini models for both LLM inference and embeddings. To use Gemini, you&#039;ll need to configure both the LLM client and embedder with your Google API key.

Install Graphiti:

```bash
poetry add &quot;graphiti-core[google-genai]&quot;

# or

uv add &quot;graphiti-core[google-genai]&quot;
```

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.gemini_client import GeminiClient, LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.embedder.gemini import GeminiEmbedder, GeminiEmbedderConfig

# Google API key configuration
api_key = &quot;&lt;your-google-api-key&gt;&quot;

# Initialize Graphiti with Gemini clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    &quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    &quot;neo4j&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;,
    llm_client=GeminiClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model=&quot;gemini-2.0-flash&quot;
        )
    ),
    embedder=GeminiEmbedder(
        config=GeminiEmbedderConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            embedding_model=&quot;embedding-001&quot;
        )
    )
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Google Gemini
```

The weights of the autoencoder are also released under [apache-2.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/choosealicense/licenses/blob/main/markdown/apache-2.0.md) and can be found in the HuggingFace repos above.

## API usage

Our API offers access to our models. It is documented here:
[docs.bfl.ml](https://docs.bfl.ml/).

In this repository we also offer an easy python interface. To use this, you
first need to register with the API on [api.bfl.ml](https://api.bfl.ml/), and
create a new API key.

To use the API key either run `export BFL_API_KEY=&lt;your_key_here&gt;` or provide
it via the `api_key=&lt;your_key_here&gt;` parameter. It is also expected that you
have installed the package as above.

Usage from python:

```python
from flux.api import ImageRequest

# this will create an api request directly but not block until the generation is finished
request = ImageRequest(&quot;A beautiful beach&quot;, name=&quot;flux.1.1-pro&quot;)
# or: request = ImageRequest(&quot;A beautiful beach&quot;, name=&quot;flux.1.1-pro&quot;, api_key=&quot;your_key_here&quot;)

# any of the following will block until the generation is finished
request.url
# -&gt; https:&lt;...&gt;/sample.jpg
request.bytes
# -&gt; b&quot;...&quot; bytes for the generated image
request.save(&quot;outputs/api.jpg&quot;)
# saves the sample to local storage
request.image
# -&gt; a PIL image
```

Usage from the command line:

```bash
$ python -m flux.api --prompt=&quot;A beautiful beach&quot; url
https:&lt;...&gt;/sample.jpg

# generate and save the result
$ python -m flux.api --prompt=&quot;A beautiful beach&quot; save outputs/api

# open the image directly
$ python -m flux.api --prompt=&quot;A beautiful beach&quot; image show
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre>List Of English Words
=============

A text file containing over 466k English words.

While searching for a list of english words (for an auto-complete tutorial)
I found: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213607/how-to-get-english-language-word-database which refers to [https://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable](https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/https://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable) (archived).

No idea why infochimps put the word list inside an excel (.xls) file.

I pulled out the words into a simple new-line-delimited text file.
Which is more useful when building apps or importing into databases etc.

Copyright still belongs to them.

Files you may be interested in:

-  [words.txt](words.txt) contains all words.
-  [words_alpha.txt](words_alpha.txt) contains only [[:alpha:]] words (words that only have letters, no numbers or symbols). If you want a quick solution choose this.
-  [words_dictionary.json](words_dictionary.json) contains all the words from words_alpha.txt as json format. 
If you are using Python, you can easily load this file and use it as a dictionary for faster performance. All the words are assigned with 1 in the dictionary.

See [read_english_dictionary.py](read_english_dictionary.py) for example usage.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Arc Pinned Tabs to HTML Bookmarks Converter

## Overview

This project provides a script for converting pinned tabs in the **Arc Browser** to standard HTML bookmarks file. These bookmarks can then be imported into any web browser.

This addresses the lack of a pinned tabs export feature in Arc Browser.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Arc Browser installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:ivnvxd/arc-export.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd arc-export`

or download using `curl`:

```sh
curl -o main.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivnvxd/arc-export/main/main.py
```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script from the command line:

```sh
python3 main.py [-h] [-s] [-o OUTPUT] [-v] [--version]

# or if there is an error:
python main.py [-h] [-s] [-o OUTPUT] [-v] [--version]
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems, manually copy the `StorableSidebar.json` file from the `~/Library/Application Support/Arc/` directory to the project&#039;s directory and run the script again.

## Features
The script supports various command-line options for enhanced functionality:

- **Show help message and exit**
  - `-h`, `--help`

- **Silence output**
  - `-s`, `--silent`

- **Specify the output file path**
  - `-o OUTPUT`, `--output OUTPUT`

- **Enable verbose output**
  - `-v`, `--verbose`

- **Print the git short hash and commit time**
  - `--version`

Example usage:

`python3 main.py -v -o my_bookmarks.html`

## How It Works

1. **Read JSON**: Reads the `StorableSidebar.json` file from the Arc Browser&#039;s directory *or* the project&#039;s directory.
2. **Convert Data**: Converts the JSON data into a hierarchical bookmarks dictionary.
3. **Generate HTML**: Transforms the bookmarks dictionary into an HTML file.
4. **Write HTML**: Saves the HTML file with a timestamp, allowing it to be imported into any web browser.

files in the sympy repository unless stated otherwise.

Our mailing list is at
&lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sympy&gt;.

## Download

The recommended installation method is through Anaconda,
&lt;https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution&gt;

You can also get the latest version of SymPy from
&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy/&gt;

To get the git version do

    $ git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git

For other options (tarballs, debs, etc.), see
&lt;https://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html&gt;.

## Documentation and Usage

For in-depth instructions on installation and building the
documentation, see the [SymPy Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/documentation-style-guide.html).

Everything is at:

&lt;https://docs.sympy.org/&gt;

You can generate everything at the above site in your local copy of
SymPy by:

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

Then the docs will be in &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;\_build/html&lt;/span&gt;. If
you don&#039;t want to read that, here is a short usage:

From this directory, start Python and:

``` python
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import Symbol, cos
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = Symbol(&#039;x&#039;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; e = 1/cos(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(e.series(x, 0, 10))
1 + x**2/2 + 5*x**4/24 + 61*x**6/720 + 277*x**8/8064 + O(x**10)
```

SymPy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the
classic python console (or IPython when available) that loads the SymPy
namespace and executes some common commands for you.

To start it, issue:

    $ bin/isympy

from this directory, if SymPy is not installed or simply:

    $ isympy

if SymPy is installed.

## Installation

To install SymPy using PyPI, run the following command:

    $ pip install sympy

To install SymPy using Anaconda, run the following command:

    $ conda install -c anaconda sympy

To install SymPy from GitHub source, first clone SymPy using `git`:

    $ git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git

Then, in the `sympy` repository that you cloned, simply run:

    $ pip install .

See &lt;https://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html&gt; for more information.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open
source. Please read our [Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.html)
page and the [SymPy Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/documentation-style-guide.html). If you
are new and looking for some way to contribute, a good place to start is
to look at the issues tagged [Easy to Fix](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Easy+to+Fix%22).

Please note that all participants in this project are expected to follow
our Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide
by its terms. See [CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Tests

To execute all tests, run:

    $./setup.py test

in the current directory.

For the more fine-grained running of tests or doctests, use `bin/test`
or respectively `bin/doctest`. The master branch is automatically tested
by GitHub Actions.

To test pull requests, use
[sympy-bot](https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot).

## Regenerate Experimental &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/span&gt; Parser/Lexer

The parser and lexer were generated with the [ANTLR4](http://antlr4.org)
toolchain in `sympy/parsing/latex/_antlr` and checked into the repo.
Presently, most users should not need to regenerate these files, but
if you plan to work on this feature, you will need the `antlr4`
command-line tool (and you must ensure that it is in your `PATH`).
One way to get it is:

    $ conda install -c conda-forge antlr=4.11.1

Alternatively, follow the instructions on the ANTLR website and download
the `antlr-4.11.1-complete.jar`. Then export the `CLASSPATH` as instructed
and instead of creating `antlr4` as an alias, make it an executable file
with the following contents:
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
java -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.11.1-complete.jar &quot;$@&quot;
```

After making changes to `sympy/parsing/latex/LaTeX.g4`, run:

    $ ./setup.py antlr

## Clean

To clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository):

    $ git clean -Xdf

which will clear everything ignored by `.gitignore`, and:

    $ git clean -df

to clear all untracked files. You can revert the most recent changes in
git with:

    $ git reset --hard

WARNING: The above commands will all clear changes you may have made,
and you will lose them forever. Be sure to check things with `git
status`, `git diff`, `git clean -Xn`, and `git clean -n` before doing any
of those.

## Bugs

Our issue tracker is at &lt;https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues&gt;. Please
report any bugs that you find. Or, even better, fork the repository on
GitHub and create a pull request. We welcome all changes, big or small,
and we will help you make the pull request if you are new to git (just
ask on our mailing list or Gitter Channel). If you further have any queries, you can find answers
on Stack Overflow using the [sympy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sympy) tag.

## Brief History

SymPy was started by Ond≈ôej ƒåert√≠k in 2005, he wrote some code during
the summer, then he wrote some more code during summer 2006. In February
2007, Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fix many things,
contributed documentation, and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz
Paprocki, Brian Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz, and Chris Wu)
improved SymPy incredibly during summer 2007 as part of the Google
Summer of Code. Pearu Peterson joined the development during the summer
2007 and he has made SymPy much more competitive by rewriting the core
from scratch, which has made it from 10x to 100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos
has contributed pretty-printing and other patches. Fredrik Johansson has
written mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.

SymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You
can see &lt;https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code&gt; for
full details. Each year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy&#039;s
development has come from Google Summer of Code students.

In 2011, Ond≈ôej ƒåert√≠k stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron
Meurer, who also started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his
place. Ond≈ôej ƒåert√≠k is still active in the community but is too busy
with work and family to play a lead development role.

Since then, a lot more people have joined the development and some
people have also left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst,
or online at:

&lt;https://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team&gt;

The git history goes back to 2007 when development moved from svn to hg.
To see the history before that point, look at
&lt;https://github.com/sympy/sympy-old&gt;.

You can use git to see the biggest developers. The command:

    $ git shortlog -ns

will show each developer, sorted by commits to the project. The command:

    $ git shortlog -ns --since=&quot;1 year&quot;

will show the top developers from the last year.

            SymPy is an open-source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provides additional examples and further outlines details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
