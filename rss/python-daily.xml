            <h2>README</h2><pre># MarkItDown

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/markitdown.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)
![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/markitdown)
[![Built by AutoGen Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-AutoGen%20Team-blue)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0:
&gt; * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;` to have backward-compatible behavior. 
&gt; * convert\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO.
&gt; * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. *No temporary files are created anymore*. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.

MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.

MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:

- PDF
- PowerPoint
- Word
- Excel
- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)
- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- HTML
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP files (iterates over contents)
- Youtube URLs
- EPubs
- ... and more!

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still
provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as
OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4o, natively &quot;_speak_&quot; Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their
responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of
Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions
are also highly token-efficient.

## Prerequisites
MarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use &#039;uv pip install&#039; rather than just &#039;pip install&#039; to install packages in this virtual environment
```

If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown
```

## Installation

To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git
cd markitdown
pip install -e &#039;packages/markitdown[all]&#039;
```

## Usage

### Command-Line

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf &gt; document.md
```

Or use `-o` to specify the output file:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md
```

You can also pipe content:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

### Optional Dependencies
MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:

```bash
pip install &#039;markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]&#039;
```

will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:

* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies
* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files
* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files
* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files
* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files
* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files
* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages
* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence
* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files
* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription

### Plugins

MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins
```

To enable plugins use:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf
```

To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.

### Azure Document Intelligence

To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e &quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;
```

More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)

### Python API

Basic usage in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert(&quot;test.xlsx&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

Document Intelligence conversion in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=&quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;test.pdf&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

To use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;, llm_prompt=&quot;optional custom prompt&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;example.jpg&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t markitdown:latest .
docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest &lt; ~/your-file.pdf &gt; output.md
```

## How to Install

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you&#039;ll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

**Financial Data**: Data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## How to Run

### ⌨️ Command Line Interface

You can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

&lt;img width=&quot;992&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b&quot; /&gt;

#### Quick Start

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the AI Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

#### Run the Backtester
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**
&lt;img width=&quot;941&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 47 52 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e794ea-8628-44e6-9a84-8f8a31ad3b47&quot; /&gt;


Note: The `--ollama`, `--start-date`, and `--end-date` flags work for the backtester, as well!

### 🖥️ Web Application

The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. This is recommended for users who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.

Please see detailed instructions on how to install and run the web application [here](https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund/tree/main/app).

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;🤓 &lt;strong&gt;My Personal Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

I grew up on an Amstrad, thanks to my dad, and never stopped building. In grad school I specialized in NLP and built crawlers for research. That’s where I learned how much extraction matters.

In 2023, I needed web-to-Markdown. The “open source” option wanted an account, API token, and $16, and still under-delivered. I went turbo anger mode, built Crawl4AI in days, and it went viral. Now it’s the most-starred crawler on GitHub.

I made it open source for **availability**, anyone can use it without a gate. Now I’m building the platform for **affordability**, anyone can run serious crawls without breaking the bank. If that resonates, join in, send feedback, or just crawl something amazing.
&lt;/details&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Why developers pick Crawl4AI&lt;/summary&gt;

- **LLM ready output**, smart Markdown with headings, tables, code, citation hints
- **Fast in practice**, async browser pool, caching, minimal hops
- **Full control**, sessions, proxies, cookies, user scripts, hooks
- **Adaptive intelligence**, learns site patterns, explores only what matters
- **Deploy anywhere**, zero keys, CLI and Docker, cloud friendly
&lt;/details&gt;


## 🚀 Quick Start 

1. Install Crawl4AI:
```bash
# Install the package
pip install -U crawl4ai

# For pre release versions
pip install crawl4ai --pre

# Run post-installation setup
crawl4ai-setup

# Verify your installation
crawl4ai-doctor
```

If you encounter any browser-related issues, you can install them manually:
```bash
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

2. Run a simple web crawl with Python:
```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import *

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/business&quot;,
        )
        print(result.markdown)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

3. Or use the new command-line interface:
```bash
# Basic crawl with markdown output
crwl https://www.nbcnews.com/business -o markdown

# Deep crawl with BFS strategy, max 10 pages
crwl https://docs.crawl4ai.com --deep-crawl bfs --max-pages 10

# Use LLM extraction with a specific question
crwl https://www.example.com/products -q &quot;Extract all product prices&quot;
```

## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 &lt;strong&gt;Using pip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup # Setup the browser
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the `crawl4ai-setup` should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. If the above doesn&#039;t work, try this more specific command:

   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

---

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode
```

Install optional features:

```bash
pip install -e &quot;.[torch]&quot;           # With PyTorch features
pip install -e &quot;.[transformer]&quot;     # With Transformer features
pip install -e &quot;.[cosine]&quot;          # With cosine similarity features
pip install -e &quot;.[sync]&quot;            # With synchronous crawling (Selenium)
pip install -e &quot;.[all]&quot;             # Install all optional features
```

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐳 &lt;strong&gt;Docker Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

&gt; 🚀 **Now Available!** Our completely redesigned Docker implementation is here! This new solution makes deployment more efficient and seamless than ever.

### New Docker Features

The new Docker implementation includes:
- **Browser pooling** with page pre-warming for faster response times
- **Interactive playground** to test and generate request code
- **MCP integration** for direct connection to AI tools like Claude Code
- **Comprehensive API endpoints** including HTML extraction, screenshots, PDF generation, and JavaScript execution
- **Multi-architecture support** with automatic detection (AMD64/ARM64)
- **Optimized resources** with improved memory management

# Visit the playground at http://localhost:11235/playground
```

### Quick Test

Run a quick test (works for both Docker options):

```python
import requests

# Submit a crawl job
response = requests.post(
    &quot;http://localhost:11235/crawl&quot;,
    json={&quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://example.com&quot;], &quot;priority&quot;: 10}
)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(&quot;Crawl job submitted successfully.&quot;)
    
if &quot;results&quot; in response.json():
    results = response.json()[&quot;results&quot;]
    print(&quot;Crawl job completed. Results:&quot;)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
else:
    task_id = response.json()[&quot;task_id&quot;]
    print(f&quot;Crawl job submitted. Task ID:: {task_id}&quot;)
    result = requests.get(f&quot;http://localhost:11235/task/{task_id}&quot;)
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## MLX LM 

MLX LM is a Python package for generating text and fine-tuning large language
models on Apple silicon with MLX.

Some key features include:

* Integration with the Hugging Face Hub to easily use thousands of LLMs with a
  single command. 
* Support for quantizing and uploading models to the Hugging Face Hub.
* [Low-rank and full model
  fine-tuning](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/blob/main/mlx_lm/LORA.md)
  with support for quantized models.
* Distributed inference and fine-tuning with `mx.distributed`

The easiest way to get started is to install the `mlx-lm` package:

**With `pip`**:

```sh
pip install mlx-lm
```

**With `conda`**:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge mlx-lm
```

### Quick Start

To generate text with an LLM use:

```bash
mlx_lm.generate --prompt &quot;How tall is Mt Everest?&quot;
```

To chat with an LLM use:

```bash
mlx_lm.chat
```

This will give you a chat REPL that you can use to interact with the LLM. The
chat context is preserved during the lifetime of the REPL.

Commands in `mlx-lm` typically take command line options which let you specify
the model, sampling parameters, and more. Use `-h` to see a list of available
options for a command, e.g.:

```bash
mlx_lm.generate -h
```

The default model for generation and chat is
`mlx-community/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit`.  You can specify any MLX-compatible
model with the `--model` flag. Thousands are available in the
[MLX Community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) Hugging Face
organization.

### Python API

You can use `mlx-lm` as a module:

```python
from mlx_lm import load, generate

model, tokenizer = load(&quot;mlx-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit&quot;)

prompt = &quot;Write a story about Einstein&quot;

messages = [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}]
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, add_generation_prompt=True
)

text = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)
```

To see a description of all the arguments you can do:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(generate)
```

Check out the [generation
example](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/tree/main/mlx_lm/examples/generate_response.py)
to see how to use the API in more detail. Check out the [batch generation
example](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/tree/main/mlx_lm/examples/batch_generate_response.py)
to see how to efficiently generate continuations for a batch of prompts.

The `mlx-lm` package also comes with functionality to quantize and optionally
upload models to the Hugging Face Hub.

You can convert models using the Python API:

```python
from mlx_lm import convert

repo = &quot;mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3&quot;
upload_repo = &quot;mlx-community/My-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit&quot;

convert(repo, quantize=True, upload_repo=upload_repo)
```

This will generate a 4-bit quantized Mistral 7B and upload it to the repo
`mlx-community/My-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit`. It will also save the
converted model in the path `mlx_model` by default.

To see a description of all the arguments you can do:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(convert)
```

#### Streaming

For streaming generation, use the `stream_generate` function. This yields
a generation response object.

For example,

```python
from mlx_lm import load, stream_generate

repo = &quot;mlx-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit&quot;
model, tokenizer = load(repo)

prompt = &quot;Write a story about Einstein&quot;

messages = [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}]
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, add_generation_prompt=True
)

for response in stream_generate(model, tokenizer, prompt, max_tokens=512):
    print(response.text, end=&quot;&quot;, flush=True)
print()
```

#### Sampling

The `generate` and `stream_generate` functions accept `sampler` and
`logits_processors` keyword arguments. A sampler is any callable which accepts
a possibly batched logits array and returns an array of sampled tokens.  The
`logits_processors` must be a list of callables which take the token history
and current logits as input and return the processed logits. The logits
processors are applied in order.

Some standard sampling functions and logits processors are provided in
`mlx_lm.sample_utils`.

### Command Line

You can also use `mlx-lm` from the command line with:

```
mlx_lm.generate --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 --prompt &quot;hello&quot;
```

This will download a Mistral 7B model from the Hugging Face Hub and generate
text using the given prompt.

For a full list of options run:

```
mlx_lm.generate --help
```

To quantize a model from the command line run:

```
mlx_lm.convert --hf-path mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 -q
```

For more options run:

```
mlx_lm.convert --help
```

You can upload new models to Hugging Face by specifying `--upload-repo` to
`convert`. For example, to upload a quantized Mistral-7B model to the
[MLX Hugging Face community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) you can do:

```
mlx_lm.convert \
    --hf-path mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 \
    -q \
    --upload-repo mlx-community/my-4bit-mistral
```

Models can also be converted and quantized directly in the
[mlx-my-repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mlx-community/mlx-my-repo) Hugging
Face Space.

### Long Prompts and Generations 

`mlx-lm` has some tools to scale efficiently to long prompts and generations:

- A rotating fixed-size key-value cache.
- Prompt caching

To use the rotating key-value cache pass the argument `--max-kv-size n` where
`n` can be any integer. Smaller values like `512` will use very little RAM but
result in worse quality. Larger values like `4096` or higher will use more RAM
but have better quality.

Caching prompts can substantially speedup reusing the same long context with
different queries. To cache a prompt use `mlx_lm.cache_prompt`. For example:

```bash
cat prompt.txt | mlx_lm.cache_prompt \
  --model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 \
  --prompt - \
  --prompt-cache-file mistral_prompt.safetensors
``` 

Then use the cached prompt with `mlx_lm.generate`:

```
mlx_lm.generate \
    --prompt-cache-file mistral_prompt.safetensors \
    --prompt &quot;\nSummarize the above text.&quot;
```

The cached prompt is treated as a prefix to the supplied prompt. Also notice
when using a cached prompt, the model to use is read from the cache and need
not be supplied explicitly.

Prompt caching can also be used in the Python API in order to avoid
recomputing the prompt. This is useful in multi-turn dialogues or across
requests that use the same context. See the
[example](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/blob/main/mlx_lm/examples/chat.py)
for more usage details.

### Supported Models

`mlx-lm` supports thousands of Hugging Face format LLMs. If the model you want to
run is not supported, file an
[issue](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/issues/new) or better yet,
submit a pull request.

Here are a few examples of Hugging Face models that work with this example:

- [mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1)
- [meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf)
- [deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct)
- [01-ai/Yi-6B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-6B-Chat)
- [microsoft/phi-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2)
- [mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1)
- [Qwen/Qwen-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-7B)
- [pfnet/plamo-13b](https://huggingface.co/pfnet/plamo-13b)
- [pfnet/plamo-13b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/pfnet/plamo-13b-instruct)
- [stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b)
- [internlm/internlm2-7b](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm2-7b)
- [tiiuae/falcon-mamba-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-mamba-7b-instruct)

Most
[Mistral](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=mistral&amp;sort=trending),
[Llama](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=llama&amp;sort=trending),
[Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=phi&amp;sort=trending),
and
[Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers,safetensors&amp;other=mixtral&amp;sort=trending)
style models should work out of the box.

For some models (such as `Qwen` and `plamo`) the tokenizer requires you to
enable the `trust_remote_code` option. You can do this by passing
`--trust-remote-code` in the command line. If you don&#039;t specify the flag
explicitly, you will be prompted to trust remote code in the terminal when
running the model. 

For `Qwen` models you must also specify the `eos_token`. You can do this by
passing `--eos-token &quot;&lt;|endoftext|&gt;&quot;` in the command
line. 

These options can also be set in the Python API. For example:

```python
model, tokenizer = load(
    &quot;qwen/Qwen-7B&quot;,
    tokenizer_config={&quot;eos_token&quot;: &quot;&lt;|endoftext|&gt;&quot;, &quot;trust_remote_code&quot;: True},
)
```

### Large Models

&gt; [!NOTE]
    This requires macOS 15.0 or higher to work.

Models which are large relative to the total RAM available on the machine can
be slow. `mlx-lm` will attempt to make them faster by wiring the memory
occupied by the model and cache. This requires macOS 15 or higher to
work.

If you see the following warning message:

&gt; [WARNING] Generating with a model that requires ...

then the model will likely be slow on the given machine. If the model fits in
RAM then it can often be sped up by increasing the system wired memory limit.
To increase the limit, set the following `sysctl`:

```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=N
```

The value `N` should be larger than the size of the model in megabytes but
smaller than the memory size of the machine.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Real-Time Voice Cloning
This repository is an implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to
Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. This was my [master&#039;s thesis](https://matheo.uliege.be/handle/2268.2/6801).

SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.

## Heads up
Like everything else in Deep Learning, this repo has quickly gotten old. Many SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository will. If you wish for an open-source solution with a high voice quality:
- Check out [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/task/speech-synthesis/) for other repositories and recent research in the field of speech synthesis.
- Check out [Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) for a similar project up to date with the 2025 SOTA in voice cloning

## Setup

### 1. Install Requirements
1. Both Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.
2. Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you&#039;ll probably have to tweak the dependencies&#039; versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using `venv`, but this is optional.
3. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages). This is necessary for reading audio files.
4. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.
5. Install the remaining requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. (Optional) Download Pretrained Models
Pretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn&#039;t work for you, you can manually download them [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).

### 3. (Optional) Test Configuration
Before you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:

`python demo_cli.py`

If all tests pass, you&#039;re good to go.

### 4. (Optional) Download Datasets
For playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading [`LibriSpeech/train-clean-100`](https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/train-clean-100.tar.gz). Extract the contents as `&lt;datasets_root&gt;/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100` where `&lt;datasets_root&gt;` is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Training#datasets). You&#039;re free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.

### 5. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

`python demo_toolbox.py -d &lt;datasets_root&gt;`  
or  
`python demo_toolbox.py`  

depending on whether you downloaded any datasets. If you are running an X-server or if you have the error `Aborted (core dumped)`, see [this issue](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues/11#issuecomment-504733590).

### 🎯 **Autonomous Multi-Agent Workflow**

**The Challenges**:

- 📄 **Implementation Complexity**: Converting academic papers and complex algorithms into working code requires significant technical effort and domain expertise

- 🔬 **Research Bottleneck**: Researchers spend valuable time implementing algorithms instead of focusing on their core research and discovery work

- ⏱️ **Development Delays**: Product teams experience long wait times between concept and testable prototypes, slowing down innovation cycles

- 🔄 **Repetitive Coding**: Developers repeatedly implement similar patterns and functionality instead of building on existing solutions

**DeepCode** addresses these workflow inefficiencies by providing reliable automation for common development tasks, streamlining your development workflow from concept to code.

## Study guide

&gt; Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).

![Imgur](images/OfVllex.png)

**Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?**

**A: No, you don&#039;t need to know everything here to prepare for the interview**.

What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

* How much experience you have
* What your technical background is
* What positions you are interviewing for
* Which companies you are interviewing with
* Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.

Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.
* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.
* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.

## How to approach a system design interview question

&gt; How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions

Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

### Step 2: Create a high level design

Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations

You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)
* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)
* [Latency numbers every programmer should know](#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)

## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you&#039;ll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](https://web.archive.org/web/20221030091841/http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](https://web.archive.org/web/20220530193911/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602114024/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126233752/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](https://web.archive.org/web/20220926171507/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we&#039;ll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we&#039;ll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.

## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

## Installation

The simplest way to get Haystack is via pip:

```sh
pip install haystack-ai
```

Install from the `main` branch to try the newest features:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git@main
```

Haystack supports multiple installation methods including Docker images. For a comprehensive guide please refer
to the [documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/installation).

## Documentation

If you&#039;re new to the project, check out [&quot;What is Haystack?&quot;](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro) then go
through the [&quot;Get Started Guide&quot;](https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/quick-start) and build your first LLM application
in a matter of minutes. Keep learning with the [tutorials](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials). For more advanced
use cases, or just to get some inspiration, you can browse our Haystack recipes in the
[Cookbook](https://haystack.deepset.ai/cookbook).

At any given point, hit the [documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/intro) to learn more about Haystack, what can it do for you and the technology behind.

## Features

- **Technology agnostic:** Allow users the flexibility to decide what vendor or technology they want and make it easy to switch out any component for another. Haystack allows you to use and compare models available from OpenAI, Cohere and Hugging Face, as well as your own local models or models hosted on Azure, Bedrock and SageMaker.
- **Explicit:** Make it transparent how different moving parts can “talk” to each other so it&#039;s easier to fit your tech stack and use case.
- **Flexible:** Haystack provides all tooling in one place: database access, file conversion, cleaning, splitting, training, eval, inference, and more. And whenever custom behavior is desirable, it&#039;s easy to create custom components.
- **Extensible:** Provide a uniform and easy way for the community and third parties to build their own components and foster an open ecosystem around Haystack.

Some examples of what you can do with Haystack:

-   Build **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** by making use of one of the available vector databases and customizing your LLM interaction, the sky is the limit 🚀
-   Perform Question Answering **in natural language** to find granular answers in your documents.
-   Perform **semantic search** and retrieve documents according to meaning.
-   Build applications that can make complex decisions making to answer complex queries: such as systems that can resolve complex customer queries, do knowledge search on many disconnected resources and so on.
-   Scale to millions of docs using retrievers and production-scale components.
-   Use **off-the-shelf models** or **fine-tune** them to your data.
-   Use **user feedback** to evaluate, benchmark, and continuously improve your models.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt;
&gt; Would you like to deploy and serve Haystack pipelines as REST APIs yourself? [Hayhooks](https://github.com/deepset-ai/hayhooks) provides a simple way to wrap your pipelines with custom logic and expose them via HTTP endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoints and compatibility with fully-featured chat interfaces like [open-webui](https://openwebui.com/).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 初次安装遇到问题请查阅 [💬 FAQ问题集合](https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/99) ，一般遇到的问题都已经有解决办法。

## 👋 最简配置运行

已经支持在 web 页面配置其他参数，docker 启动命令如下:

```bash
docker run -p 58090:8090 -e XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT=58090 -v /xiaomusic_music:/app/music -v /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf hanxi/xiaomusic
```

🔥 国内：

```bash
docker run -p 58090:8090 -e XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT=58090 -v /xiaomusic_music:/app/music -v /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf docker.hanxi.cc/hanxi/xiaomusic
```

对应的 docker compose 配置如下：

```yaml
services:
  xiaomusic:
    image: hanxi/xiaomusic
    container_name: xiaomusic
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 58090:8090
    environment:
      XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT: 58090
    volumes:
      - /xiaomusic_music:/app/music
      - /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf
```

🔥 国内：

```yaml
services:
  xiaomusic:
    image: docker.hanxi.cc/hanxi/xiaomusic
    container_name: xiaomusic
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 58090:8090
    environment:
      XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT: 58090
    volumes:
      - /xiaomusic_music:/app/music
      - /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf
```

- 其中 conf 目录为配置文件存放目录，music 目录为音乐存放目录，建议分开配置为不同的目录。
- /xiaomusic_music 和 /xiaomusic_conf 是 docker 所在的主机的目录，可以修改为其他目录。如果报错找不到 /xiaomusic_music 目录，可以先执行 `mkdir -p /xiaomusic_{music,conf}` 命令新建目录。
- /app/music 和 /app/conf 是 docker 容器里的目录，不要去修改。
- XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT 是用来配置 NAS 本地端口的。8090 是容器端口，不要去修改。
- 后台访问地址为： http://NAS_IP:58090

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; docker 和 docker compose 二选一即可，启动成功后，在 web 页面可以配置其他参数，带有 `*` 号的配置是必须要配置的，其他的用不上时不用修改。初次配置时需要在页面上输入小米账号和密码保存后才能获取到设备列表。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 目前安装步骤已经是最简化了，如果还是嫌安装麻烦，可以微信或者 QQ 约我远程安装，我一般周末和晚上才有时间，需要赞助个辛苦费 :moneybag: 50 元一次。

遇到问题可以去 web 设置页面底部点击【下载日志文件】按钮，然后搜索一下日志文件内容确保里面没有账号密码信息后(有就删除这些敏感信息)，然后在提 issues 反馈问题时把下载的日志文件带上。

### 🤐 支持语音口令

- 【播放歌曲】，播放本地的歌曲
- 【播放歌曲+歌名】，比如：播放歌曲周杰伦晴天
- 【上一首】
- 【下一首】
- 【单曲循环】
- 【全部循环】
- 【随机播放】
- 【关机】，【停止播放】，两个效果是一样的。
- 【刷新列表】，当复制了歌曲进 music 目录后，可以用这个口令刷新歌单。
- 【播放列表+列表名】，比如：播放列表其他。
- 【加入收藏】，把当前播放的歌曲加入收藏歌单。
- 【取消收藏】，把当前播放的歌曲从收藏歌单里移除。
- 【播放列表收藏】，这个用于播放收藏歌单。
- ~【播放本地歌曲+歌名】，这个口令和播放歌曲的区别是本地找不到也不会去下载。~
- 【播放列表第几个+列表名】，具体见： &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/158&gt;
- 【搜索播放+关键词】，会搜索关键词作为临时搜索列表播放，比如说【搜索播放林俊杰】，会播放所有林俊杰的歌。
- 【本地搜索播放+关键词】，跟搜索播放的区别是本地找不到也不会去下载。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 隐藏玩法: 对小爱同学说播放歌曲小猪佩奇的故事，会先下载小猪佩奇的故事，然后再播放小猪佩奇的故事。

## 🛠️ pip 方式安装运行

```shell
&gt; pip install -U xiaomusic
&gt; xiaomusic --help
 __  __  _                   __  __                 _
 \ \/ / (_)   __ _    ___   |  \/  |  _   _   ___  (_)   ___
  \  /  | |  / _` |  / _ \  | |\/| | | | | | / __| | |  / __|
  /  \  | | | (_| | | (_) | | |  | | | |_| | \__ \ | | | (__
 /_/\_\ |_|  \__,_|  \___/  |_|  |_|  \__,_| |___/ |_|  \___|
          XiaoMusic v0.3.69 by: github.com/hanxi

usage: xiaomusic [-h] [--port PORT] [--hardware HARDWARE] [--account ACCOUNT]
                 [--password PASSWORD] [--cookie COOKIE] [--verbose]
                 [--config CONFIG] [--ffmpeg_location FFMPEG_LOCATION]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --port PORT           监听端口
  --hardware HARDWARE   小爱音箱型号
  --account ACCOUNT     xiaomi account
  --password PASSWORD   xiaomi password
  --cookie COOKIE       xiaomi cookie
  --verbose             show info
  --config CONFIG       config file path
  --ffmpeg_location FFMPEG_LOCATION
                        ffmpeg bin path
&gt; xiaomusic --config config.json
```

其中 `config.json` 文件可以参考 `config-example.json` 文件配置。见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/94&gt;

不修改默认端口 8090 的情况下，只需要执行 `xiaomusic` 即可启动。

## 🔩 开发环境运行

- 使用 install_dependencies.sh 下载依赖
- 使用 pdm 安装环境
- 默认监听了端口 8090 , 使用其他端口自行修改。

```shell
pdm run xiaomusic.py
````

如果是开发前端界面，可以通过 &lt;http://localhost:8090/docs&gt;
查看有什么接口。目前的 web 控制台非常简陋，欢迎有兴趣的朋友帮忙实现一个漂亮的前端，需要什么接口可以随时提需求。

### 🚦 代码提交规范

提交前请执行

```
pdm lintfmt
```

用于检查代码和格式化代码。

### 本地编译 Docker Image

```shell
docker build -t xiaomusic .
```

### 技术栈

- 后端代码使用 Python 语言编写。
- HTTP 服务使用的是 FastAPI 框架，~~早期版本使用的是 Flask~~。
- 使用了 Docker ，在 NAS 上安装更方便。
- 默认的前端主题使用了 jQuery 。

型号与产品名称对照可以在这里查询 &lt;https://home.miot-spec.com/s/xiaomi.wifispeaker&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 如果你的设备支持播放，请反馈给我添加到支持列表里，谢谢。
&gt; 目前应该所有设备类型都已经支持播放，有问题随时反馈。
&gt; 其他触屏版不能播放可以设置【型号兼容模式】选项为 true 试试。见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/30&gt;

## 🎵 支持音乐格式

- mp3
- flac
- wav
- ape
- ogg
- m4a

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 本地音乐会搜索目录下上面格式的文件，下载的歌曲是 mp3 格式的。
&gt; 已知 L05B L05C LX06 L16A 不支持 flac 格式。
&gt; 如果格式不能播放可以打开【转换为MP3】和【型号兼容模式】选项。具体见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/153#issuecomment-2328168689&gt;

## 🌏 网络歌单功能

可以配置一个 json 格式的歌单，支持电台和歌曲，也可以直接用别人分享的链接，同时配备了 m3u 文件格式转换工具，可以很方便的把 m3u 电台文件转换成网络歌单格式的 json 文件，具体用法见  &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/78&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 欢迎有想法的朋友们制作更多的歌单转换工具。

## 🍺 更多其他可选配置

见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/333&gt;

## ⚠️ 安全提醒

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt;
&gt; 1. 如果配置了公网访问 xiaomusic ，请一定要开启密码登陆，并设置复杂的密码。且不要在公共场所的 WiFi 环境下使用，否则可能造成小米账号密码泄露。
&gt; 2. 强烈不建议将小爱音箱的小米账号绑定摄像头，代码难免会有 bug ，一旦小米账号密码泄露，可能监控录像也会泄露。
