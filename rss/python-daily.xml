[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/markitdown.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)
![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/markitdown)
[![Built by AutoGen Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-AutoGen%20Team-blue)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0:
&gt; * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;` to have backward-compatible behavior. 
&gt; * convert\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO.
&gt; * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. *No temporary files are created anymore*. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.

MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.

MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:

- PDF
- PowerPoint
- Word
- Excel
- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)
- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- HTML
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP files (iterates over contents)
- Youtube URLs
- EPubs
- ... and more!

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still
provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as
OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4o, natively &quot;_speak_&quot; Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their
responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of
Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions
are also highly token-efficient.

## Prerequisites
MarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use &#039;uv pip install&#039; rather than just &#039;pip install&#039; to install packages in this virtual environment
```

If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown
```

## Installation

To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git
cd markitdown
pip install -e &#039;packages/markitdown[all]&#039;
```

## Usage

### Command-Line

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf &gt; document.md
```

Or use `-o` to specify the output file:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md
```

You can also pipe content:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

### Optional Dependencies
MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:

```bash
pip install &#039;markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]&#039;
```

will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:

* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies
* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files
* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files
* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files
* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files
* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files
* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages
* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence
* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files
* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription

### Plugins

MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins
```

To enable plugins use:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf
```

To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.

### Azure Document Intelligence

To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e &quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;
```

More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)

### Python API

Basic usage in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert(&quot;test.xlsx&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

Document Intelligence conversion in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=&quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;test.pdf&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

To use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;example.jpg&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t markitdown:latest .
docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest &lt; ~/your-file.pdf &gt; output.md
```

Qlib is an open-source, AI-oriented quantitative investment platform that aims to realize the potential, empower research, and create value using AI technologies in quantitative investment, from exploring ideas to implementing productions. Qlib supports diverse machine learning modeling paradigms, including supervised learning, market dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning.

An increasing number of SOTA Quant research works/papers in diverse paradigms are being released in Qlib to collaboratively solve key challenges in quantitative investment. For example, 1) using supervised learning to mine the market&#039;s complex non-linear patterns from rich and heterogeneous financial data, 2) modeling the dynamic nature of the financial market using adaptive concept drift technology, and 3) using reinforcement learning to model continuous investment decisions and assist investors in optimizing their trading strategies.

It contains the full ML pipeline of data processing, model training, back-testing; and covers the entire chain of quantitative investment: alpha seeking, risk modeling, portfolio optimization, and order execution. 
For more details, please refer to our paper [&quot;Qlib: An AI-oriented Quantitative Investment Platform&quot;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11189).

# Framework of Qlib

&lt;div style=&quot;align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The high-level framework of Qlib can be found above(users can find the [detailed framework](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/introduction.html#framework) of Qlib&#039;s design when getting into nitty gritty).
The components are designed as loose-coupled modules, and each component could be used stand-alone.

Qlib provides a strong infrastructure to support Quant research. [Data](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html) is always an important part.
A strong learning framework is designed to support diverse learning paradigms (e.g. [reinforcement learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html), [supervised learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html#model-section)) and patterns at different levels(e.g. [market dynamic modeling](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/meta.html)).
By modeling the market, [trading strategies](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html) will generate trade decisions that will be executed. Multiple trading strategies and executors in different levels or granularities can be [nested to be optimized and run together](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/highfreq.html).
At last, a comprehensive [analysis](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) will be provided and the model can be [served online](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/online.html) in a low cost.


# Quick Start

This quick start guide tries to demonstrate
1. It&#039;s very easy to build a complete Quant research workflow and try your ideas with _Qlib_.
2. Though with *public data* and *simple models*, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.

Here is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install ``Qlib``, and run LightGBM with ``qrun``. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](#data-preparation).


## Installation

This table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:
|               | install with pip      | install from source  |        plot        |
| ------------- |:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| Python 3.8    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.9    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.10   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.11   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.12   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |

**Note**: 
1. **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment. In some cases, using Python outside of a `conda` environment may result in missing header files, causing the installation failure of certain packages.
2. Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing ``Qlib`` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to *upgrade* Python to version 3.8 or higher, or use `conda`&#039;s Python to install ``Qlib`` from source.

### Install with pip
Users can easily install ``Qlib`` by pip according to the following command.

```bash
  pip install pyqlib
```

**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.

### Install from source
Also, users can install the latest dev version ``Qlib`` by the source code according to the following steps:

* Before installing ``Qlib`` from source, users need to install some dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install --upgrade cython
  ```

* Clone the repository and install ``Qlib`` as follows.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git &amp;&amp; cd qlib
    pip install .  # `pip install -e .[dev]` is recommended for development. check details in docs/developer/code_standard_and_dev_guide.rst
    ```

**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment,  comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.

**Tips for Mac**: If you are using Mac with M1, you might encounter issues in building the wheel for LightGBM, which is due to missing dependencies from OpenMP. To solve the problem, install openmp first with ``brew install libomp`` and then run ``pip install .`` to build it successfully. 

## Data Preparation
❗ Due to more restrict data security policy. The official dataset is disabled temporarily. You can try [this data source](https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases) contributed by the community.
Here is an example to download the latest data.
```bash
wget https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases/latest/download/qlib_bin.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data
tar -zxvf qlib_bin.tar.gz -C ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --strip-components=1
rm -f qlib_bin.tar.gz
```

The official dataset below will resume in short future.


----

Load and prepare data by running the following code:

### Get with module
  ```bash
  # get 1d data
  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn

  # get 1min data
  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min

  ```

### Get from source

  ```bash
  # get 1d data
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn

  # get 1min data
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min

  ```

This dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](scripts/data_collector/), which have been released in
the same repository.
Users could create the same dataset with it. [Description of dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector#description-of-dataset)

*Please pay **ATTENTION** that the data is collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup), and the data might not be perfect.
We recommend users to prepare their own data if they have a high-quality dataset. For more information, users can refer to the [related document](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html#converting-csv-format-into-qlib-format)*.

### Automatic update of daily frequency data (from yahoo finance)
  &gt; This step is *Optional* if users only want to try their models and strategies on history data.
  &gt; 
  &gt; It is recommended that users update the data manually once (--trading_date 2021-05-25) and then set it to update automatically.
  &gt;
  &gt; **NOTE**: Users can&#039;t incrementally  update data based on the offline data provided by Qlib(some fields are removed to reduce the data size). Users should use [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance) to download Yahoo data from scratch and then incrementally update it.
  &gt; 
  &gt; For more information, please refer to: [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance)

  * Automatic update of data to the &quot;qlib&quot; directory each trading day(Linux)
      * use *crontab*: `crontab -e`
      * set up timed tasks:

        ```
        * * * * 1-5 python &lt;script path&gt; update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir &lt;user data dir&gt;
        ```
        * **script path**: *scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py*

  * Manual update of data
      ```
      python scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir &lt;user data dir&gt; --trading_date &lt;start date&gt; --end_date &lt;end date&gt;
      ```
      * *trading_date*: start of trading day
      * *end_date*: end of trading day(not included)

### Checking the health of the data
  * We provide a script to check the health of the data, you can run the following commands to check whether the data is healthy or not.
    ```
    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data
    ```
  * Of course, you can also add some parameters to adjust the test results, such as this.
    ```
    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_dat

# Core Philosophy: Connect, Unify, Respond

MindsDB&#039;s architecture is built around three fundamental capabilities:

## [Connect](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview) Your Data

You can connect to hundreds of enterprise [data sources (learn more)](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview). These integrations allow MindsDB to access data wherever it resides, forming the foundation for all other capabilities.

## [Unify](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/overview) Your Data

Once connected, these data sources can be queried using a full SQL dialect, as if they were all part of a single database. MindsDB’s federated query engine translates your SQL queries and executes them on the appropriate connected data sources.

When working with many data sources, it’s important to prepare and unify your data before generating responses from it. MindsDB SQL offers virtual tables (views, knowledge bases, ml-models) to allow working with heterogeneous data as if it were unified in a single organized system.

* [**VIEWS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/view) – Simplify data access by creating unified views across different sources (no-ETL).
* [**KNOWLEDGE BASES**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases) – Index and organize unstructured data for efficient retrieval.
* [**ML MODELS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/model) – Apply AI/ML transformations to gain insights from your data.

Unification of data can be automated using JOBs

* [**JOBS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) – Schedule synchronization and transformation tasks for real-time processing.


## [Respond](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) From Your Data

Chat with Your Data

* [**AGENTS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) – Configure built-in agents specialized in answering questions over your connected and unified data.
* [**MCP**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mcp/overview) – Connect to MindsDB through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless interaction.

## 📏 RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards

**RULER** (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) eliminates the need for hand-crafted reward functions by using an LLM-as-judge to automatically score agent trajectories. Simply define your task in the system prompt, and RULER handles the rest—**no labeled data, expert feedback, or reward engineering required**.

✨ **Key Benefits:**
- **2-3x faster development** - Skip reward function engineering entirely
- **General-purpose** - Works across any task without modification  
- **Strong performance** - Matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in 3/4 benchmarks
- **Easy integration** - Drop-in replacement for manual reward functions

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, &quot;openai/o3&quot;)
```

## Why ART?

- ART provides convenient wrappers for introducing RL training into **existing applications**. We abstract the training server into a modular service that your code doesn&#039;t need to interface with.
- **Train from anywhere.** Run the ART client on your laptop and let the ART server kick off an ephemeral GPU-enabled environment, or run on a local GPU.
- Integrations with hosted platforms like W&amp;B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe provide flexible observability and **simplify debugging**.
- ART is customizable with **intelligent defaults**. You can configure training parameters and inference engine configurations to meet specific needs, or take advantage of the defaults, which have been optimized for training efficiency and stability.

## Installation

ART agents can be trained from any client machine that runs python. To add to an existing project, run this command:

```
pip install openpipe-art
```

## 🤖 ART•E Agent

Curious about how to use ART for a real-world task? Check out the [ART•E Agent](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent) blog post, where we detail how we trained Qwen 2.5 14B to beat o3 at email retrieval!

## 🔁 Training Loop Overview

ART&#039;s functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**. The OpenAI-compatible client is responsible for interfacing between ART and your codebase. Using the client, you can pass messages and get completions from your LLM as it improves. The server runs independently on any machine with a GPU. It abstracts away the complexity of the inference and training portions of the RL loop while allowing for some custom configuration. An outline of the training loop is shown below:

1. **Inference**

   1. Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow (usually executing several rollouts in parallel to gather data faster).
   2. Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model&#039;s latest LoRA in vLLM.
   3. As the agent executes, each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
   4. When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward` to its Trajectory, indicating the performance of the LLM.

2. **Training**
   1. When each rollout has finished, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked while training executes.
   2. The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA on the first iteration).
   3. The server saves the newly trained LoRA to a local directory and loads it into vLLM.
   4. Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.

This training loop runs until a specified number of inference and training iterations have completed.

## 🧩 Supported Models

ART should work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, or at least the ones supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models). Gemma 3 does not appear to be supported for the time being. If any other model isn&#039;t working for you, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues)!

# Installing

## Windows Portable

There is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).

### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)

Simply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) and run. Make sure you put your Stable Diffusion checkpoints/models (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints

If you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -&gt; properties -&gt; unblock

#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?

See the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.


## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)

You can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:
```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy install
```

## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)

python 3.13 is supported but using 3.12 is recommended because some custom nodes and their dependencies might not support it yet.

Git clone this repo.

Put your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints

Put your VAE in: models/vae


### AMD GPUs (Linux only)
AMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don&#039;t have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.3```

This is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 6.4 which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4```

### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)

(Option 1) Intel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip (currently available in PyTorch nightly builds). More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)
  
1. To install PyTorch nightly, use the following command:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```

2. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`


(Option 2) Alternatively, Intel GPUs supported by Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) can leverage IPEX for improved performance.

1. For Intel® Arc™ A-Series Graphics utilizing IPEX, create a conda environment and use the commands below:

```
conda install libuv
pip install torch==2.3.1.post0+cxx11.abi torchvision==0.18.1.post0+cxx11.abi torchaudio==2.3.1.post0+cxx11.abi intel-extension-for-pytorch==2.3.110.post0+xpu --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/ --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/cn/
```

For other supported Intel GPUs with IPEX, visit [Installation](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/index.html#installation?platform=gpu) for more information.

Additional discussion and help can be found [here](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/discussions/476).

### NVIDIA

Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128```

This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu129```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the &quot;Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled&quot; error, uninstall torch with:

```pip uninstall torch```

And install it again with the command above.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.

### Others:

#### Apple Mac silicon

You can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.

1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).
1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.
1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).
1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

&gt; **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).

#### DirectML (AMD Cards on Windows)

This is very badly supported and is not recommended. There are some unofficial builds of pytorch ROCm on windows that exist that will give you a much better experience than this. This readme will be updated once official pytorch ROCm builds for windows come out.

```pip install torch-directml``` Then you can launch ComfyUI with: ```python main.py --directml```

#### Ascend NPUs

For models compatible with Ascend Extension for PyTorch (torch_npu). To get started, ensure your environment meets the prerequisites outlined on the [installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/ascend/quick_install.html) page.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Check out the new [MCP server for Graphiti](mcp_server/README.md)! Give Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients powerful Knowledge Graph-based memory.

Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically tailored for AI agents operating in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti continuously integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph. The framework supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without requiring complete graph recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI applications.

Use Graphiti to:

- Integrate and maintain dynamic user interactions and business data.
- Facilitate state-based reasoning and task automation for agents.
- Query complex, evolving data with semantic, keyword, and graph-based search methods.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;images/graphiti-graph-intro.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Graphiti temporal walkthrough&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot;&gt;   
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected facts, such as _&quot;Kendra loves Adidas shoes.&quot;_ Each fact is a &quot;triplet&quot; represented by two entities, or
nodes (&quot;Kendra&quot;, &quot;Adidas shoes&quot;), and their relationship, or edge (&quot;loves&quot;). Knowledge Graphs have been explored
extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph
while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context.

## Graphiti and Zep Memory

Graphiti powers the core of [Zep&#039;s memory layer](https://www.getzep.com) for AI Agents.

Using Graphiti, we&#039;ve demonstrated Zep is
the [State of the Art in Agent Memory](https://blog.getzep.com/state-of-the-art-agent-memory/).

Read our paper: [Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956).

We&#039;re excited to open-source Graphiti, believing its potential reaches far beyond AI memory applications.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

## Why Graphiti?

Traditional RAG approaches often rely on batch processing and static data summarization, making them inefficient for frequently changing data. Graphiti addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Real-Time Incremental Updates:** Immediate integration of new data episodes without batch recomputation.
- **Bi-Temporal Data Model:** Explicit tracking of event occurrence and ingestion times, allowing accurate point-in-time queries.
- **Efficient Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic embeddings, keyword (BM25), and graph traversal to achieve low-latency queries without reliance on LLM summarization.
- **Custom Entity Definitions:** Flexible ontology creation and support for developer-defined entities through straightforward Pydantic models.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently manages large datasets with parallel processing, suitable for enterprise environments.

Graphiti is specifically designed to address the challenges of dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time interaction and precise historical queries.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j 5.26 / FalkorDB 1.1.2 or higher (serves as the embeddings storage backend)
- OpenAI API key (Graphiti defaults to OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding)

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Graphiti works best with LLM services that support Structured Output (such as OpenAI and Gemini).
&gt; Using other services may result in incorrect output schemas and ingestion failures. This is particularly
&gt; problematic when using smaller models.

Optional:

- Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq API key (for alternative LLM providers)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; The simplest way to install Neo4j is via [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/). It provides a user-friendly
&gt; interface to manage Neo4j instances and databases.
&gt; Alternatively, you can use FalkorDB on-premises via Docker and instantly start with the quickstart example:

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest

```

```bash
pip install graphiti-core
```

or

```bash
uv add graphiti-core
```

### Installing with FalkorDB Support

If you plan to use FalkorDB as your graph database backend, install with the FalkorDB extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordb]
```

### You can also install optional LLM providers as extras:

```bash
# Install with Anthropic support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic]

# Install with Groq support
pip install graphiti-core[groq]

# Install with Google Gemini support
pip install graphiti-core[google-genai]

# Install with multiple providers
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic,groq,google-genai]

# Install with FalkorDB and LLM providers
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb,anthropic,google-genai]
```

## Quick Start

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Graphiti defaults to using OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding. Ensure that an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment.
&gt; Support for Anthropic and Groq LLM inferences is available, too. Other LLM providers may be supported via OpenAI
&gt; compatible APIs.

For a complete working example, see the [Quickstart Example](./examples/quickstart/README.md) in the examples directory. The quickstart demonstrates:

1. Connecting to a Neo4j or FalkorDB database
2. Initializing Graphiti indices and constraints
3. Adding episodes to the graph (both text and structured JSON)
4. Searching for relationships (edges) using hybrid search
5. Reranking search results using graph distance
6. Searching for nodes using predefined search recipes

The example is fully documented with clear explanations of each functionality and includes a comprehensive README with setup instructions and next steps.

## MCP Server

The `mcp_server` directory contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Graphiti. This server allows AI assistants to interact with Graphiti&#039;s knowledge graph capabilities through the MCP protocol.

Key features of the MCP server include:

- Episode management (add, retrieve, delete)
- Entity management and relationship handling
- Semantic and hybrid search capabilities
- Group management for organizing related data
- Graph maintenance operations

The MCP server can be deployed using Docker with Neo4j, making it easy to integrate Graphiti into your AI assistant workflows.

For detailed setup instructions and usage examples, see the [MCP server README](./mcp_server/README.md).

## REST Service

The `server` directory contains an API service for interacting with the Graphiti API. It is built using FastAPI.

Please see the [server README](./server/README.md) for more information.

## Optional Environment Variables

In addition to the Neo4j and OpenAi-compatible credentials, Graphiti also has a few optional environment variables.
If you are using one of our supported models, such as Anthropic or Voyage models, the necessary environment variables
must be set.

### Database Configuration

Database names are configured directly in the driver constructors:

- **Neo4j**: Database name defaults to `neo4j` (hardcoded in Neo4jDriver)
- **FalkorDB**: Database name defaults to `default_db` (hardcoded in FalkorDriver)

As of v0.17.0, if you need to customize your database configuration, you can instantiate a database driver and pass it to the Graphiti constructor using the `graph_driver` parameter.

#### Neo4j with Custom Database Name

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neo4j_driver import Neo4jDriver

# Create a Neo4j driver with custom database name
driver = Neo4jDriver(
    uri=&quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    user=&quot;neo4j&quot;,
    password=&quot;password&quot;,
    database=&quot;my_custom_database&quot;  # Custom database name
)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### FalkorDB with Custom Database Name

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.falkordb_driver import FalkorDriver

# Create a FalkorDB driver with custom database name
driver = FalkorDriver(
    host=&quot;localhost&quot;,
    port=6379,
    username=&quot;falkor_user&quot;,  # Optional
    password=&quot;falkor_password&quot;,  # Optional
    database=&quot;my_custom_graph&quot;  # Custom database name
)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```


### Performance Configuration

`USE_PARALLEL_RUNTIME` is an optional boolean variable that can be set to true if you wish
to enable Neo4j&#039;s parallel runtime feature for several of our search queries.
Note that this feature is not supported for Neo4j Community edition or for smaller AuraDB instances,
as such this feature is off by default.

## Using Graphiti with Azure OpenAI

Graphiti supports Azure OpenAI for both LLM inference and embeddings. Azure deployments often require different endpoints for LLM and embedding services, and separate deployments for default and small models.

```python

## Using Graphiti with Google Gemini

Graphiti supports Google&#039;s Gemini models for LLM inference, embeddings, and cross-encoding/reranking. To use Gemini, you&#039;ll need to configure the LLM client, embedder, and the cross-encoder with your Google API key.

Install Graphiti:

```bash
uv add &quot;graphiti-core[google-genai]&quot;

# or

pip install &quot;graphiti-core[google-genai]&quot;
```

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.gemini_client import GeminiClient, LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.embedder.gemini import GeminiEmbedder, GeminiEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.gemini_reranker_client import GeminiRerankerClient

# Google API key configuration
api_key = &quot;&lt;your-google-api-key&gt;&quot;

# Initialize Graphiti with Gemini clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    &quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    &quot;neo4j&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;,
    llm_client=GeminiClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model=&quot;gemini-2.0-flash&quot;
        )
    ),
    embedder=GeminiEmbedder(
        config=GeminiEmbedderConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            embedding_model=&quot;embedding-001&quot;
        )
    ),
    cross_encoder=GeminiRerankerClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17&quot;
        )
    )
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Google Gemini for all components
```

The Gemini reranker uses the `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` model by default, which is optimized for cost-effective and low-latency classification tasks. It uses the same boolean classification approach as the OpenAI reranker, leveraging Gemini&#039;s log probabilities feature to rank passage relevance.

## Using Graphiti with Ollama (Local LLM)

Graphiti supports Ollama for running local LLMs and embedding models via Ollama&#039;s OpenAI-compatible API. This is ideal for privacy-focused applications or when you want to avoid API costs.

Install the models:
ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b # LLM
ollama pull nomic-embed-text # embeddings

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.config import LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.llm_client.openai_client import OpenAIClient
from graphiti_core.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder, OpenAIEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.openai_reranker_client import OpenAIRerankerClient

# Configure Ollama LLM client
llm_config = LLMConfig(
    api_key=&quot;abc&quot;,  # Ollama doesn&#039;t require a real API key
    model=&quot;deepseek-r1:7b&quot;,
    small_model=&quot;deepseek-r1:7b&quot;,
    base_url=&quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;, # Ollama provides this port
)

llm_client = OpenAIClient(config=llm_config)

# Initialize Graphiti with Ollama clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    &quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    &quot;neo4j&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;,
    llm_client=llm_client,
    embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(
        config=OpenAIEmbedderConfig(
            api_key=&quot;abc&quot;,
            embedding_model=&quot;nomic-embed-text&quot;,
            embedding_dim=768,
            base_url=&quot;http://localhost:11434/v1&quot;,
        )
    ),
    cross_encoder=OpenAIRerankerClient(client=llm_client, config=llm_config),
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with local Ollama models
```

Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) and that you have pulled the models you want to use.

## Telemetry

Graphiti collects anonymous usage statistics to help us understand how the framework is being used and improve it for everyone. We believe transparency is important, so here&#039;s exactly what we collect and why.

### What We Collect

When you initialize a Graphiti instance, we collect:

- **Anonymous identifier**: A randomly generated UUID stored locally in `~/.cache/graphiti/telemetry_anon_id`
- **System information**: Operating system, Python version, and system architecture
- **Graphiti version**: The version you&#039;re using
- **Configuration choices**:
  - LLM provider type (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, etc.)
  - Database backend (Neo4j, FalkorDB)
  - Embedder provider (OpenAI, Azure, Voyage, etc.)

### What We Don&#039;t Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We **never** collect:

- Personal information or identifiers
- API keys or credentials
- Your actual data, queries, or graph content
- IP addresses or hostnames
- File paths or system-specific information
- Any content from your episodes, nodes, or edges

### Why We Collect This Data

This information helps us:

- Understand which configurations are most popular to prioritize support and testing
- Identify which LLM and database providers to focus development efforts on
- Track adoption patterns to guide our roadmap
- Ensure compatibility across different Python versions and operating systems

By sharing this anonymous information, you help us make Graphiti better for everyone in the community.

### View the Telemetry Code

The Telemetry code [may be found here](graphiti_core/telemetry/telemetry.py).

### How to Disable Telemetry

Telemetry is **opt-out** and can be disabled at any time. To disable telemetry collection:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```bash
export GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

**Option 2: Set in your shell profile**

```bash
# For bash users (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile)
echo &#039;export GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

# For zsh users (~/.zshrc)
echo &#039;export GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_E

# Changelog

- 2025/07/05 Version 2.1.0 Released
  - This is the first major update of MinerU 2, which includes a large number of new features and improvements, covering significant performance optimizations, user experience enhancements, and bug fixes. The detailed update contents are as follows:
  - **Performance Optimizations:**
    - Significantly improved preprocessing speed for documents with specific resolutions (around 2000 pixels on the long side).
    - Greatly enhanced post-processing speed when the `pipeline` backend handles batch processing of documents with fewer pages (&lt;10 pages).
    - Layout analysis speed of the `pipeline` backend has been increased by approximately 20%.
  - **Experience Enhancements:**
    - Built-in ready-to-use `fastapi service` and `gradio webui`. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to [Documentation](#3-api-calls-or-visual-invocation).
    - Adapted to `sglang` version `0.4.8`, significantly reducing the GPU memory requirements for the `vlm-sglang` backend. It can now run on graphics cards with as little as `8GB GPU memory` (Turing architecture or newer).
    - Added transparent parameter passing for all commands related to `sglang`, allowing the `sglang-engine` backend to receive all `sglang` parameters consistently with the `sglang-server`.
    - Supports feature extensions based on configuration files, including `custom formula delimiters`, `enabling heading classification`, and `customizing local model directories`. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to [Documentation](#4-extending-mineru-functionality-through-configuration-files).
  - **New Features:**
    - Updated the `pipeline` backend with the PP-OCRv5 multilingual text recognition model, supporting text recognition in 37 languages such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Korean, with an average accuracy improvement of over 30%. [Details](https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleOCR/latest/en/version3.x/algorithm/PP-OCRv5/PP-OCRv5_multi_languages.html)
    - Introduced limited support for vertical text layout in the `pipeline` backend.

  &lt;summary&gt;History Log&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;2025/06/20 2.0.6 Released&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed occasional parsing interruptions caused by invalid block content in &lt;code&gt;vlm&lt;/code&gt; mode&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed parsing interruptions caused by incomplete table structures in &lt;code&gt;vlm&lt;/code&gt; mode&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;2025/06/17 2.0.5 Released&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed the issue where models were still required to be downloaded in the &lt;code&gt;sglang-client&lt;/code&gt; mode&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed the issue where the &lt;code&gt;sglang-client&lt;/code&gt; mode unnecessarily depended on packages like &lt;code&gt;torch&lt;/code&gt; during runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed the issue where only the first instance would take effect when attempting to launch multiple &lt;code&gt;sglang-client&lt;/code&gt; instances via multiple URLs within the same process&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  
  &lt;details&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Updated Dockerfile and installation documentation for deploying the full version of MinerU in sglang environment&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  
  &lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;2025/06/13 2.0.0 Released&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;: MinerU 2.0 has been deeply restructured in code organization and interaction methods, significantly improving system usability, maintainability, and extensibility.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removal of Third-party Dependency Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;: Completely eliminated the dependency on &lt;code&gt;pymupdf&lt;/code&gt;, moving the project toward a more open and compliant open-source direction.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready-to-use, Easy Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: No need to manually edit JSON configuration files; most parameters can now be set directly via command line or API.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Model Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Added automatic model download and update mechanisms, allowing users to complete model deployment without manual intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline Deployment Friendly&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides built-in model download commands, supporting deployment requirements in completely offline environments.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined Code Structure&lt;/strong&gt;: Removed thousands of lines of redundant code, simplified class inheritance logic, significantly improving code readability and development efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified Intermediate Format Output&lt;/strong&gt;: Adopted standardized &lt;code&gt;middle_json&lt;/code&gt; format, compatible with most secondary development scenarios based on this format, ensuring seamless ecosystem business migration.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Model&lt;/strong&gt;: MinerU 2.0 integrates our latest small-parameter, high-performance multimodal document parsing model, achieving end-to-end high-speed, high-precision document understanding.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Model, Big Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: With parameters under 1B, yet surpassing traditional 72B-level vision-language models (VLMs) in parsing accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Functions in One&lt;/strong&gt;: A single model covers multilingual recognition, handwriting recognition, layout analysis, table parsing, formula recognition, reading order sorting, and other core tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimate Inference Speed&lt;/strong&gt;: Achieves peak throughput exceeding 10,000 tokens/s through &lt;code&gt;sglang&lt;/code&gt; acceleration on a single NVIDIA 4090 card, easily handling large-scale document processing requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: You can experience our brand-new VLM model on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mineru.net/OpenSourceTools/Extractor&quot;&gt;MinerU.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/opendatalab/MinerU&quot;&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/OpenDataLab/MinerU&quot;&gt;ModelScope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incompatible Changes Notice&lt;/strong&gt;: To improve overall architectural rationality and long-term maintainability, this version contains some incompatible changes:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Python package name changed from &lt;code&gt;magic-pdf&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;mineru&lt;/code&gt;, and the command-line tool changed from &lt;code&gt;magic-pdf&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;mineru&lt;/code&gt;. Please update your scripts and command calls accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For modular system design and ecosystem consistency considerations, MinerU 2.0 no longer includes the LibreOffice document conversion module. If you need to process Office documents, we recommend converting them to PDF format through an independently deployed LibreOffice service before proceeding with subsequent parsing operations.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;2025/05/24 Release 1.3.12&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added support for PPOCRv5 models, updated &lt;code&gt;ch_server&lt;/code&gt; model to &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv5_rec_server&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ch_lite&lt;/code&gt; model to &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv5_rec_mobile&lt;/code&gt; (model update required)
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;In testing, we found that PPOCRv5(server) has some improvement for handwritten documents, but has slightly lower accuracy than v4_server_doc for other document types, so the default ch model remains unchanged as &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_server_rec_doc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Since PPOCRv5 has enhanced recognition capabilities for handwriting and special characters, you can manually choose the PPOCRv5 model for Japanese-Traditional Chinese mixed scenarios and handwritten documents&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;You can select the appropriate model through the lang parameter &lt;code&gt;lang=&#039;ch_server&#039;&lt;/code&gt; (Python API) or &lt;code&gt;--lang ch_server&lt;/code&gt; (command line):
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_server_rec_doc&lt;/code&gt; (default) (Chinese/English/Japanese/Traditional Chinese mixed/15K dictionary)&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ch_server&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv5_rec_server&lt;/code&gt; (Chinese/English/Japanese/Traditional Chinese mixed + handwriting/18K dictionary)&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ch_lite&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv5_rec_mobile&lt;/code&gt; (Chinese/English/Japanese/Traditional Chinese mixed + handwriting/18K dictionary)&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ch_server_v4&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_rec_server&lt;/code&gt; (Chinese/English mixed/6K dictionary)&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ch_lite_v4&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_rec_mobile&lt;/code&gt; (Chinese/English mixed/6K dictionary)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added support for handwritten documents through optimized layout recognition of handwritten text areas
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;This feature is supported by default, no additional configuration required&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;You can refer to the instructions above to manually select the PPOCRv5 model for better handwritten document parsing results&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;huggingface&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;modelscope&lt;/code&gt; demos have been updated to versions that support handwriting recognition and PPOCRv5 models, which you can experience online&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;2025/04/29 Release 1.3.10&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added support for custom formula delimiters, which can be configured by modifying the &lt;code&gt;latex-delimiter-config&lt;/code&gt; section in the &lt;code&gt;magic-pdf.json&lt;/code&gt; file in your user directory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;2025/04/27 Release 1.3.9&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Optimized formula parsing functionality, improved formula rendering success rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  
  &lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;2025/04/23 Release 1.3.8&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The default &lt;code&gt;ocr&lt;/code&gt; model (&lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt;) has been updated to &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_server_rec_doc&lt;/code&gt; (model update required)
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_server_rec_doc&lt;/code&gt; is trained on a mixture of more Chinese document data and PP-OCR training data based on &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_server_rec&lt;/code&gt;, adding recognition capabilities for some traditional Chinese characters, Japanese, and special characters. It can recognize over 15,000 characters and improves both document-specific and general text recognition abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleX/latest/module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/text_recognition.html#_3&quot;&gt;Performance comparison of PP-OCRv4_server_rec_doc/PP-OCRv4_server_rec/PP-OCRv4_mobile_rec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;After verification, the &lt;code&gt;PP-OCRv4_server_rec_doc&lt;/code&gt; model shows significant accuracy improvements in Chinese/English/Japanes

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/agentic-doc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/agentic-doc)

**[Web App](https://va.landing.ai/demo/doc-extraction) · [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RVcW3j9RgR) · [Blog](https://landing.ai/blog/going-beyond-ocrllm-introducing-agentic-document-extraction) · [Docs](https://support.landing.ai/docs/document-extraction)**

&lt;/div&gt;

## Overview

The LandingAI **Agentic Document Extraction** API pulls structured data out of visually complex documents—think tables, pictures, and charts—and returns a hierarchical JSON with exact element locations.

This Python library wraps that API to provide:

* **Long‑document support** – process 100+ page PDFs in a single call  
* **Auto‑retry / paging** – handles concurrency, time‑outs, and rate limits  
* **Helper utilities** – bounding‑box snippets, visual debuggers, and more  

### Features

- 📦 **Batteries‑included install:** `pip install agentic-doc` – nothing else needed → see [Installation](#installation)
- 🗂️ **All file types:** parse PDFs of *any* length, single images, or URLs → see [Supported Files](#supported-files)
- 📚 **Long‑doc ready:** auto‑split &amp; parallel‑process 1000+ page PDFs, then stitch results → see [Parse Large PDF Files](#parse-large-pdf-files)
- 🧩 **Structured output:** returns hierarchical JSON plus ready‑to‑render Markdown → see [Result Schema](#result-schema)
- 👁️ **Ground‑truth visuals:** optional bounding‑box snippets and full‑page visualizations → see [Save Groundings as Images](#save-groundings-as-images)
- 🏃 **Batch &amp; parallel:** feed a list; library manages threads &amp; rate limits (`BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_WORKERS`) → see [Parse Multiple Files in a Batch](#parse-multiple-files-in-a-batch)
- 🔄 **Resilient:** exponential‑backoff retries for 408/429/502/503/504 and rate‑limit hits → see [Automatically Handle API Errors and Rate Limits with Retries](#automatically-handle-api-errors-and-rate-limits-with-retries)
- 🛠️ **Drop‑in helpers:** `parse_documents`, `parse_and_save_documents`, `parse_and_save_document` → see [Main Functions](#main-functions)
- ⚙️ **Config via env / .env:** tweak parallelism, logging style, retry caps—no code changes → see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)
- 🌐 **Raw API ready:** advanced users can still hit the REST endpoint directly → see the [API Docs](https://support.landing.ai/docs/document-extraction)


## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install agentic-doc
```

### Requirements
- Python version 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12
- LandingAI agentic AI API key (get the key [here](https://va.landing.ai/settings/api-key))

### Set the API Key as an Environment Variable
After you get the LandingAI agentic AI API key, set the key as an environment variable (or put it in a `.env` file):

```bash
export VISION_AGENT_API_KEY=&lt;your-api-key&gt;
```

### Supported Files
The library can extract data from:
- PDFs (any length)
- Images that are supported by OpenCV-Python (i.e. the `cv2` library)
- URLs pointing to PDF or image files

### Basic Usage

#### Extract Data from One Document
Run the following script to extract data from one document and return the results in both markdown and structured chunks.

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse

# Parse a local file
result = parse(&quot;path/to/image.png&quot;)
print(result[0].markdown)  # Get the extracted data as markdown
print(result[0].chunks)  # Get the extracted data as structured chunks of content

# Parse a document from a URL
result = parse(&quot;https://example.com/document.pdf&quot;)
print(result[0].markdown)

# Legacy approach (still supported)
from agentic_doc.parse import parse_documents
results = parse_documents([&quot;path/to/image.png&quot;])
parsed_doc = results[0]
```

#### Extract Data from Multiple Documents
Run the following script to extract data from multiple documents.

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse

# Parse multiple local files
file_paths = [&quot;path/to/your/document1.pdf&quot;, &quot;path/to/another/document2.pdf&quot;]
results = parse(file_paths)
for result in results:
    print(result.markdown)

# Parse and save results to a directory
results = parse(file_paths, result_save_dir=&quot;path/to/save/results&quot;)
result_paths = []
for result in results:
    result_paths.append(result.result_path)
# result_paths: [&quot;path/to/save/results/document1_20250313_070305.json&quot;, ...]
```


#### Using field extraction

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agentic_doc.parse import parse

class ExtractedFields(BaseModel):
    employee_name: str = Field(description=&quot;the full name of the employee&quot;)
    employee_ssn: str = Field(description=&quot;the social security number of the employee&quot;)
    gross_pay: float = Field(description=&quot;the gross pay of the employee&quot;)
    employee_address: str = Field(description=&quot;the address of the employee&quot;)

results = parse(&quot;mydoc.pdf&quot;, extraction_model=ExtractedFields)
fields = results[0].extraction
metadata = results[0].extraction_metadata
print(f&quot;Field value: {fields.employee_name}, confidence: {metadata.employee_name.experimental_confidence}&quot;)
```


#### Extract Data Using Connectors
The library now supports various connectors to easily access documents from different sources:

##### Google Drive Connector

**Prerequisites: Follow the [Google Drive API Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/quickstart/python) tutorial first to set up your credentials.**

The Google Drive API quickstart will guide you through:
1. Creating a Google Cloud project
2. Enabling the Google Drive API
3. Setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials

After completing the quickstart tutorial, you can use the Google Drive connector as follows:

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse
from agentic_doc.connectors import GoogleDriveConnectorConfig

# Using OAuth credentials file (from quickstart tutorial)
config = GoogleDriveConnectorConfig(
    client_secret_file=&quot;path/to/credentials.json&quot;,
    folder_id=&quot;your-google-drive-folder-id&quot;  # Optional
)

# Parse all documents in the folder
results = parse(config)

# Parse with filtering
results = parse(config, connector_pattern=&quot;*.pdf&quot;)
```

##### Amazon S3 Connector
```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse
from agentic_doc.connectors import S3ConnectorConfig

config = S3ConnectorConfig(
    bucket_name=&quot;your-bucket-name&quot;,
    aws_access_key_id=&quot;your-access-key&quot;,  # Optional if using IAM roles
    aws_secret_access_key=&quot;your-secret-key&quot;,  # Optional if using IAM roles
    region_name=&quot;us-east-1&quot;
)

# Parse all documents in the bucket
results = parse(config)

# Parse documents in a specific prefix/folder
results = parse(config, connector_path=&quot;documents/&quot;)
```

##### Local Directory Connector
```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse
from agentic_doc.connectors import LocalConnectorConfig

config = LocalConnectorConfig()

# Parse all supported documents in a directory
results = parse(config, connector_path=&quot;/path/to/documents&quot;)

# Parse with pattern filtering
results = parse(config, connector_path=&quot;/path/to/documents&quot;, connector_pattern=&quot;*.pdf&quot;)

# Parse all supported documents in a directory recursively (search subdirectories as well)
config = LocalConnectorConfig(recursive=True)
results = parse(config, connector_path=&quot;/path/to/documents&quot;)
```

##### URL Connector
```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse
from agentic_doc.connectors import URLConnectorConfig

config = URLConnectorConfig(
    headers={&quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer your-token&quot;},  # Optional
    timeout=60  # Optional
)

# Parse document from URL
results = parse(config, connector_path=&quot;https://example.com/document.pdf&quot;)
```

#### Raw Bytes Input

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse

# Load a PDF or image file as bytes
with open(&quot;document.pdf&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:
    raw_bytes = f.read()

# Parse the document from bytes
results = parse(raw_bytes)
```

You can also parse image bytes:

```python
with open(&quot;image.png&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

results = parse(image_bytes)
```

This is useful when documents are already loaded into memory (e.g., from an API response or uploaded via a web interface). The parser will auto-detect the file type from the bytes.


## Why Use It?

- **Simplified Setup:** No need to manage API keys or handle low-level REST calls.
- **Automatic Large File Processing:** Splits large PDFs into manageable parts and processes them in parallel.
- **Built-In Error Handling:** Automatically retries requests with exponential backoff and jitter for common HTTP errors.
- **Parallel Processing:** Efficiently parse multiple documents at once with configurable parallelism.

## Main Features

With this library, you can do things that are otherwise hard to do with the Agentic Document Extraction API alone.
This section describes some of the key features this library offers.

### Parse Large PDF Files

**A single REST API call can only handle up to certain amount of pages at a time** (see [rate limits](https://docs.landing.ai/ade/ade-rate-limits#maximum-pages-per-document)). This library automatically splits a large PDF into multiple calls, uses a thread pool to process the calls in parallel, and stitches the results back together as a single result.

We&#039;ve used this library to successfully parse PDFs that are 1000+ pages long.

### Parse Multiple Files in a Batch

You can parse multiple files in a single function call with this library. The library processes files in parallel.

&gt; **NOTE:** You can change the parallelism by setting the `batch_size` setting.

### Save Groundings as Images

The library can extract and save the visual regions (groundings) of the document where each chunk of content was found. This is useful for visualizing exactly what parts of the document were extracted and for debugging extraction issues.

Each grounding represents a bounding box in the original document, and the library can save these regions as individual PNG images. The images are organized by page number and chunk ID.

Here&#039;s how to use this feature:

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse_documents

# Save groundings when parsing a document
results = parse_documents(
    [&quot;path/to/document.pdf&quot;],
    grounding_save_dir=&quot;path/to/save/groundings&quot;
)

# The grounding images will be saved to:
# path/to/save/groundings/document_TIMESTAMP/page_X/CHUNK_TYPE_CHUNK_ID_Y.png
# Where X is the page number, CHUNK_ID is the unique ID of each chunk,
# and Y is the index of the grounding within the chunk

# Each chunk&#039;s grounding in the result will have the image_path set
for chunk in results[0].chunks:
    for grounding in chunk.grounding:
        if grounding.image_path:
            print(f&quot;Grounding saved to: {grounding.image_path}&quot;)
```

This feature works with all parsing functions: `parse_documents`, `parse_and_save_documents`, and `parse_and_save_document`.

### Visualize Parsing Result

The library provides a visualization utility that creates annotated images showing where each chunk of content was extracted from the document. This is useful for:
- Verifying the accuracy of the extraction
- Debugging extraction issues

Here&#039;s how to use the visualization feature:

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse
from agentic_doc.utils import viz_parsed_document
from agentic_doc.config import VisualizationConfig

# Parse a document
results = parse(&quot;path/to/document.pdf&quot;)
parsed_doc = results[0]

# Create visualizations with default settings
# The output images have a PIL.Image.Image type
images = viz_parsed_document(
    &quot;path/to/document.pdf&quot;,
    parsed_doc,
    output_dir=&quot;path/to/save/visualizations&quot;
)

# Or customize the visualization appearance
viz_config = VisualizationConfig(
    thickness=2,  # Thicker bounding boxes
    text_bg_opacity=0.8,  # More opaque text background
    font_scale=0.7,  # Larger text
    # Custom colors for different chunk types
    color_map={
        ChunkType.TITLE: (0, 0, 255),  # Red for titles
        ChunkType.TEXT: (255, 0, 0),  # Blue for regular text
        # ... other chunk types ...
    }
)

images = viz_parsed_document(
    &quot;path/to/document.pdf&quot;,
    parsed_doc,
    output_dir=&quot;path/to/save/visualizations&quot;,
    viz_config=viz_config
)

# The visualization images will be saved as:
# path/to/save/visualizations/document_viz_page_X.png
# Where X is the page number
```

The visualization shows:
- Bounding boxes around each extracted chunk
- Chunk type and index labels
- Different colors for different types of content (titles, text, tables, etc.)
- Semi-transparent text backgrounds for better readability

### Automatically Handle API Errors and Rate Limits with Retries

The REST API endpoint imposes rate limits per API key. This library automatically handles the rate limit error or other intermittent HTTP errors with retries.

For more information, see [Error Handling](#error-handling) and [Configuration Options](#configuration-options).

### Error Handling

This library implements a retry mechanism for handling API failures:

- Retries are performed for these HTTP status codes: 408, 429, 502, 503, 504.
- Exponential backoff with jitter is used for retry wait time.
- The initial retry wait time is 1 second, which increases exponentially.
- Retry will stop after `max_retries` attempts. Exceeding the limit raises an exception and results in a failure for this request.
- Retry wait time is capped at `max_retry_wait_time` seconds.
- Retries include a random jitter of up to 10 seconds to distribute requests and prevent the thundering herd problem.

### Parsing Errors

If the REST API request encounters an unrecoverable error during parsing (either from client-side or server-side), the library includes an [errors](./agentic_doc/common.py#L75) field in the final result for the affected page(s).
Each error contains the error message, error_code and corresponding page number.

## Configuration Options

The library uses a [`Settings`](./agentic_doc/config.py) object to manage configuration. You can customize these settings either through environment variables or a `.env` file:

Below is an example `.env` file that customizes the configurations:

```bash
# Number of files to process in parallel, defaults to 4
BATCH_SIZE=4
# Number of threads used to process parts of each file in parallel, defaults to 5.
MAX_WORKERS=2
# Maximum number of retry attempts for failed intermittent requests, defaults to 100
MAX_RETRIES=80
# Maximum wait time in seconds for each retry, defaults to 60
MAX_RETRY_WAIT_TIME=30
# Logging style for retry, defaults to log_msg
RETRY_LOGGING_STYLE=log_msg
```

### Max Parallelism

The maximum number of parallel requests is determined by multiplying `BATCH_SIZE` × `MAX_WORKERS`.

&gt; **NOTE:** The maximum parallelism allowed by this library is 100.

Specifically, increasing `MAX_WORKERS` can speed up the processing of large individual files, while increasing `BATCH_SIZE` improves throughput when processing multiple files.

&gt; **NOTE:** Your job&#039;s maximum processing throughput may be limited by your API rate limit. If your rate limit isn&#039;t high enough, you may encounter rate limit errors, which the library will automatically handle through retries.

The optimal values for `MAX_WORKERS` and `BATCH_SIZE` depend on your API rate limit and the latency of each REST API call. For example, if your account has a rate limit of 5 requests per minute, and each REST API call takes approximately 60 seconds to complete, and you&#039;re processing a single large file, then `MAX_WORKERS` should be set to 5 and `BATCH_SIZE` to 1.

You can find your REST API latency in the logs. If you want to increase your rate limit, schedule a time to meet with us [here](https://scheduler.zoom.us/d/56i81uc2/landingai-document-extraction).

### Set `RETRY_LOGGING_STYLE`

The `RETRY_LOGGING_STYLE` setting controls how the library logs the retry attempts.

- `log_msg`: Log the retry attempts as a log messages. Each attempt is logged as a separate message. This is the default setting.
- `inline_block`: Print a yellow progress block (&#039;█&#039;) on the same line. Each block represents one retry attempt. Choose this if you don&#039;t want to see the verbose retry logging message and still want to track the number of retries that have been made.
- `none`: Do not log the retry attempts.


## Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ

### Common Issues
- **API Key Errors:**  
  Ensure your API key is correctly set as an environment variable.
- **Rate Limits:**  
  The library automatically retries requests if you hit the API rate limit. Adjust `BATCH_SIZE` or `MAX_WORKERS` if you encounter frequent rate limit errors.
- **Parsing Failures:**  
  If a document fails to parse, an error chunk will be included in the result, detailing the error message and page index.
- **URL Access Issues:**
  If you&#039;re having trouble accessing documents from URLs, check that the URLs are publicly accessible and point to supported file types (PDF or images).

### Note on `include_marginalia` and `include_metadata_in_markdown`

- `include_marginalia`: If True, the parser will attempt to extract and include marginalia (footer notes, page number, etc.) from the document in the output.
- `include_metadata_in_markdown`: If True, the output markdown will include metadata.

Both parameters default to True. You can set them to False to exclude these elements from the output.

#### Example: Using the new parameters

```python
from agentic_doc.parse import parse

results = parse(
    &quot;path/to/document.pdf&quot;,
    include_marginalia=False,  # Exclude marginalia from output
    include_metadata_in_markdown=False  # Exclude metadata from markdown
)

## What is Agno?

[Agno](https://docs.agno.com) is a full-stack framework for building Multi-Agent Systems with memory, knowledge and reasoning.

Use Agno to build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:
- Level 1: Agents with tools and instructions.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge and storage.
- Level 3: Agents with memory and reasoning.
- Level 4: Agent Teams that can reason and collaborate.
- Level 5: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism.

Example: Level 1 Reasoning Agent that uses the YFinance API to answer questions:

```python reasoning_finance_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id=&quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions=&quot;Use tables to display data.&quot;,
    markdown=True,
)
```

## Get Started

If you&#039;re new to Agno, read the documentation to build your [first Agent](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/agents), chat with it on the [playground](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/playground) and monitor it on [agno.com](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/monitoring).

After that, checkout the [Examples Gallery](https://docs.agno.com/examples) and build real-world applications with Agno.

## Why Agno?

Agno will help you build best-in-class, highly-performant agentic systems, saving you hours of research and boilerplate. Here are some key features that set Agno apart:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Highly performant**: Agents instantiate in **~3μs** and use **~6.5Kib** memory on average.
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Reasoning improves reliability and is a must-have for complex autonomous agents. Agno supports 3 approaches to reasoning: Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
- **Natively Multi-Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they accept text, image, audio and video as input and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with reasoning, memory, and shared context.
- **Built-in Agentic Search**: Agents can search for information at runtime using 20+ vector databases. Agno provides state-of-the-art Agentic RAG, **fully async and highly performant.**
- **Built-in Memory &amp; Session Storage**: Agents come with built-in `Storage` &amp; `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: After building your Agents, serve them using pre-built FastAPI routes. 0 to production in minutes.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Installation

```shell
pip install -U agno
```

## Example - Reasoning Agent

Let&#039;s build a Reasoning Agent to get a sense of Agno&#039;s capabilities.

Save this code to a file: `reasoning_agent.py`.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id=&quot;claude-sonnet-4-20250514&quot;),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions=[
        &quot;Use tables to display data&quot;,
        &quot;Only output the report, no other text&quot;,
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response(
    &quot;Write a report on NVDA&quot;,
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True,
)
```

Then create a virtual environment, install dependencies, export your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and run the agent.

```shell
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install agno anthropic yfinance

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxx

python reasoning_agent.py
```

We can see the Agent is reasoning through the task, using the `ReasoningTools` and `YFinanceTools` to gather information. This is how the output looks like:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb99955-9848-49a9-9732-3e19d77b2ff8

## Example - Multi Agent Teams

Agents are the atomic unit of work, and work best when they have a narrow scope and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the model can handle or you need to handle multiple concepts, use a team of agents to spread the load.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from agno.team import Team

web_agent = Agent(
    name=&quot;Web Agent&quot;,
    role=&quot;Search the web for information&quot;,
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=&quot;Always include sources&quot;,
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name=&quot;Finance Agent&quot;,
    role=&quot;Get financial data&quot;,
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions=&quot;Use tables to display data&quot;,
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team = Team(
    mode=&quot;coordinate&quot;,
    members=[web_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIChat(id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;),
    success_criteria=&quot;A comprehensive financial news report with clear sections and data-driven insights.&quot;,
    instructions=[&quot;Always include sources&quot;, &quot;Use tables to display data&quot;],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team.print_response(&quot;What&#039;s the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?&quot;, stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent team:

```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search yfinance

python agent_team.py
```

## Performance

At Agno, we&#039;re obsessed with performance. Why? because even simple AI workflows can spawn thousands of Agents. Scale that to a modest number of users and performance becomes a bottleneck. Agno is designed for building high performance agentic systems:

- Agent instantiation: ~3μs on average
- Memory footprint: ~6.5Kib on average

&gt; Tested on an Apple M4 Mackbook Pro.

While an Agent&#039;s run-time is bottlenecked by inference, we must do everything possible to minimize execution time, reduce memory usage, and parallelize tool calls. These numbers may seem trivial at first, but our experience shows that they add up even at a reasonably small scale.

### Instantiation time

Let&#039;s measure the time it takes for an Agent with 1 tool to start up. We&#039;ll run the evaluation 1000 times to get a baseline measurement.

You should run the evaluation yourself on your own machine, please, do not take these results at face value.

```shell
# Setup virtual environment
./scripts/perf_setup.sh
source .venvs/perfenv/bin/activate
# OR Install dependencies manually
# pip install openai agno langgraph langchain_openai

# Agno
python evals/performance/instantiation_with_tool.py

# LangGraph
python evals/performance/other/langgraph_instantiation.py
```

&gt; The following evaluation is run on an Apple M4 Mackbook Pro. It also runs as a Github action on this repo.

LangGraph is on the right, **let&#039;s start it first and give it a head start**.

Agno is on the left, notice how it finishes before LangGraph gets 1/2 way through the runtime measurement, and hasn&#039;t even started the memory measurement. That&#039;s how fast Agno is.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba466d45-75dd-45ac-917b-0a56c5742e23

### Memory usage

To measure memory usage, we use the `tracemalloc` library. We first calculate a baseline memory usage by running an empty function, then run the Agent 1000x times and calculate the difference. This gives a (reasonably) isolated measurement of the memory usage of the Agent.

We recommend running the evaluation yourself on your own machine, and digging into the code to see how it works. If we&#039;ve made a mistake, please let us know.

### Conclusion

Agno agents are designed for performance and while we do share some benchmarks against other frameworks, we should be mindful that accuracy and reliability are more important than speed.

Given that each framework is different and we won&#039;t be able to tune their performance like we do with Agno, for future benchmarks we&#039;ll only be comparing against ourselves.

## Complete Documentation Index

For LLMs and AI assistants to understand and navigate Agno&#039;s complete documentation, we provide an [LLMs.txt](https://docs.agno.com/llms.txt) or [LLMs-Full.txt](https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt) file.

This file is specifically formatted for AI systems to efficiently parse and reference our documentation.

### Cursor Setup

When building Agno agents, using Agno documentation as a source in Cursor is a great way to speed up your development.

1. In Cursor, go to the &quot;Cursor Settings&quot; menu.
2. Find the &quot;Indexing &amp; Docs&quot; section.
3. Add `https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt` to the list of documentation URLs.
4. Save the changes.

Now, Cursor will have access to the Agno documentation.

## Logo and Trademark

The brand name ERPNext and the logo are trademarks of Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

### Introduction

Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Frappe) owns and oversees the trademarks for the ERPNext name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the ERPNext name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve ERPNext.
- We’d like to make it clear how ERPNext-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the ERPNext name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the ERPNext name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official ERPNext resources.

### Frappe Trademark Usage Policy

Permission from Frappe is required to use the ERPNext name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the ERPNext name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the ERPNext software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which ERPNext is distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the ERPNext name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use ERPNext as part of a domain name.

Use of the ERPNext name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other ERPNext-related businesses or projects can use the ERPNext name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by ERPNext or Frappe Technologies or the ERPNext open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering ERPNext consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The ERPNext Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the ERPNext logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use ERPNext as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around ERPNext. We encourage ERPNext-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

When in doubt about your use of the ERPNext name or logo, please contact Frappe Technologies for clarification.

# Vanna
Vanna is an MIT-licensed open-source Python RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework for SQL generation and related functionality.

https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna/assets/7146154/1901f47a-515d-4982-af50-f12761a3b2ce

![vanna-quadrants](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna/assets/7146154/1c7c88ba-c144-4ecf-a028-cf5ba7344ca2)

## How Vanna works

![Screen Recording 2024-01-24 at 11 21 37 AM](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna/assets/7146154/1d2718ad-12a8-4a76-afa2-c61754462f93)


Vanna works in two easy steps - train a RAG &quot;model&quot; on your data, and then ask questions which will return SQL queries that can be set up to automatically run on your database.

1. **Train a RAG &quot;model&quot; on your data**.
2. **Ask questions**.

![](img/vanna-readme-diagram.png)

If you don&#039;t know what RAG is, don&#039;t worry -- you don&#039;t need to know how this works under the hood to use it. You just need to know that you &quot;train&quot; a model, which stores some metadata and then use it to &quot;ask&quot; questions.

See the [base class](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna/blob/main/src/vanna/base/base.py) for more details on how this works under the hood.

## Getting started
See the [documentation](https://vanna.ai/docs/) for specifics on your desired database, LLM, etc.

If you want to get a feel for how it works after training, you can try this [Colab notebook](https://vanna.ai/docs/app/).


### Install
```bash
pip install vanna
```

There are a number of optional packages that can be installed so see the [documentation](https://vanna.ai/docs/) for more details.

### Import
See the [documentation](https://vanna.ai/docs/) if you&#039;re customizing the LLM or vector database.

```python
# The import statement will vary depending on your LLM and vector database. This is an example for OpenAI + ChromaDB

from vanna.openai.openai_chat import OpenAI_Chat
from vanna.chromadb.chromadb_vector import ChromaDB_VectorStore

class MyVanna(ChromaDB_VectorStore, OpenAI_Chat):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        ChromaDB_VectorStore.__init__(self, config=config)
        OpenAI_Chat.__init__(self, config=config)

vn = MyVanna(config={&#039;api_key&#039;: &#039;sk-...&#039;, &#039;model&#039;: &#039;gpt-4-...&#039;})

# See the documentation for other options

```


## Training
You may or may not need to run these `vn.train` commands depending on your use case. See the [documentation](https://vanna.ai/docs/) for more details.

These statements are shown to give you a feel for how it works.

### Train with DDL Statements
DDL statements contain information about the table names, columns, data types, and relationships in your database.

```python
vn.train(ddl=&quot;&quot;&quot;
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my-table (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        age INT
    )
&quot;&quot;&quot;)
```

### Train with Documentation
Sometimes you may want to add documentation about your business terminology or definitions.

```python
vn.train(documentation=&quot;Our business defines XYZ as ...&quot;)
```

### Train with SQL
You can also add SQL queries to your training data. This is useful if you have some queries already laying around. You can just copy and paste those from your editor to begin generating new SQL.

```python
vn.train(sql=&quot;SELECT name, age FROM my-table WHERE name = &#039;John Doe&#039;&quot;)
```


## Asking questions
```python
vn.ask(&quot;What are the top 10 customers by sales?&quot;)
```

You&#039;ll get SQL
```sql
SELECT c.c_name as customer_name,
        sum(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount)) as total_sales
FROM   snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1.lineitem l join snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1.orders o
        ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey join snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1.customer c
        ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_sales desc limit 10;
```

If you&#039;ve connected to a database, you&#039;ll get the table:
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;dataframe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;CUSTOMER_NAME&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;TOTAL_SALES&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000143500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6757566.0218&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000095257&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6294115.3340&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000087115&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6184649.5176&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000131113&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6080943.8305&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000134380&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6075141.9635&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000103834&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6059770.3232&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000069682&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6057779.0348&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000102022&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6039653.6335&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000098587&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6027021.5855&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Customer#000064660&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5905659.6159&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You&#039;ll also get an automated Plotly chart:

## RAG vs. Fine-Tuning
RAG
- Portable across LLMs
- Easy to remove training data if any of it becomes obsolete
- Much cheaper to run than fine-tuning
- More future-proof -- if a better LLM comes out, you can just swap it out

Fine-Tuning
- Good if you need to minimize tokens in the prompt
- Slow to get started
- Expensive to train and run (generally)

## Why Vanna?

1. **High accuracy on complex datasets.**
    - Vanna’s capabilities are tied to the training data you give it
    - More training data means better accuracy for large and complex datasets
2. **Secure and private.**
    - Your database contents are never sent to the LLM or the vector database
    - SQL execution happens in your local environment
3. **Self learning.**
    - If using via Jupyter, you can choose to &quot;auto-train&quot; it on the queries that were successfully executed
    - If using via other interfaces, you can have the interface prompt the user to provide feedback on the results
    - Correct question to SQL pairs are stored for future reference and make the future results more accurate
4. **Supports any SQL database.**
    - The package allows you to connect to any SQL database that you can otherwise connect to with Python
5. **Choose your front end.**
    - Most people start in a Jupyter Notebook.
    - Expose to your end users via Slackbot, web app, Streamlit app, or a custom front end.

## Extending Vanna
Vanna is designed to connect to any database, LLM, and vector database. There&#039;s a [VannaBase](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna/blob/main/src/vanna/base/base.py) abstract base class that defines some basic functionality. The package provides implementations for use with OpenAI and ChromaDB. You can easily extend Vanna to use your own LLM or vector database. See the [documentation](https://vanna.ai/docs/) for more details.

AWS zero to hero repo for devops engineers to learn AWS in 30 Days. This repo includes projects, presentations, interview questions and real time examples. Each day&#039;s class will provide real-time knowledge on AWS services, allowing you to apply what you&#039;ve learned and gain practical skills in working with AWS in a DevOps context.

## Day 1: Introduction to AWS

You will learn what is private and public cloud. Why companies are moving to public cloud, what are the advantages of moving to cloud.

Also, you will be introduced to the basics of AWS, including the core services and their significance in DevOps practices. Finally learn how to set up an AWS account and navigate the AWS Management Console.

## Day 2: IAM (Identity and Access Management)

You will explore IAM, which is used for managing access to AWS resources. You&#039;ll learn how to create IAM users, groups, and roles, and how to apply permissions and security best practices to ensure proper access control.

## Day 3: EC2 Instances

You&#039;ll dive into EC2, which provides virtual servers in the cloud. You&#039;ll learn how to launch EC2 instances, connect to them using SSH, and understand key concepts such as instance types, security groups, and key pairs.

**Your First AWS Project**: Deploy a simple web application(such as jenkins) on the ec2 instance and access the application from outside AWS.

## Day 4: AWS Networking (VPC)

You&#039;ll explore AWS networking concepts, with a specific focus on VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). You&#039;ll learn how to create and configure VPCs, subnets, and route tables, enabling you to design and manage the network infrastructure for your applications.

## Day 5: AWS Security

This day emphasizes security best practices in AWS. You&#039;ll learn how to implement security measures such as security groups, network ACLs (Access Control Lists), and IAM policies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your AWS resources.

## Day 6: AWS Route 53

**Project:** Configure and manage a domain name using Route 53. You&#039;ll register a domain, set up DNS records, and explore advanced features such as health checks, routing policies, and DNS-based failover.

## Day 7: Secure VPC Setup with EC2 Instances

**Project:**

- Design and configure a VPC:
    Create a VPC with custom IP ranges.
    Set up public and private subnets.
    Configure route tables and associate subnets.

- Implement network security:
    Set up network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    Configure security groups for EC2 instances to allow specific ports and protocols.

- Provision EC2 instances:
    Launch EC2 instances in both the public and private subnets.
    Configure security groups for the instances to allow necessary traffic.
    Create and assign IAM roles to the instances with appropriate permissions.

- Networking and routing:
    Set up an internet gateway to allow internet access for instances in the public subnet.
    Configure NAT gateway or NAT instance to enable outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet.
    Create appropriate route tables and associate them with the subnets.

- SSH key pair and access control:
    Generate an SSH key pair and securely store the private key.
    Configure the instances to allow SSH access only with the generated key pair.
    Implement IAM policies and roles to control access and permissions to AWS resources.

- Test and validate the setup:
    SSH into the EC2 instances using the private key and verify connectivity.
    Test network connectivity between instances in different subnets.
    Validate security group rules and network ACL settings.

By implementing this project, you&#039;ll gain hands-on experience in setting up a secure VPC with EC2 instances, implementing networking and routing, configuring security groups and IAM roles, and ensuring proper access control. This project will provide a practical understanding of how these AWS services work together to create a secure and scalable infrastructure for your applications.

## Day 8: AWS Interview Questions on EC2, IAM and VPC

## 📋 前置依赖

### 🚀 uv 安装（推荐）

在进行下一步操作之前，请确保电脑上已经安装了 uv：

- **安装地址**：[uv 官方安装指南](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)
- **验证安装**：终端输入命令 `uv --version`，如果正常显示版本号，证明已经安装成功
- **推荐理由**：uv 是目前最强的 Python 包管理工具，速度快、依赖解析准确

### 🟢 Node.js 安装

项目依赖 Node.js，请前往官网下载安装：

- **下载地址**：https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- **版本要求**：&gt;= 16.0.0

### 📦 Python 包安装

# 进入项目目录
cd MediaCrawler

# 使用 uv sync 命令来保证 python 版本和相关依赖包的一致性
uv sync
```

### 🌐 浏览器驱动安装

```shell
# 安装浏览器驱动
uv run playwright install
```

&gt; **💡 提示**：MediaCrawler 目前已经支持使用 playwright 连接你本地的 Chrome 浏览器了，一些因为 Webdriver 导致的问题迎刃而解了。
&gt;
&gt; 目前开放了 `xhs` 和 `dy` 这两个使用 CDP 的方式连接本地浏览器，如有需要，查看 `config/base_config.py` 中的配置项。

## 🚀 运行爬虫程序

```shell
# 项目默认是没有开启评论爬取模式，如需评论请在 config/base_config.py 中的 ENABLE_GET_COMMENTS 变量修改
# 一些其他支持项，也可以在 config/base_config.py 查看功能，写的有中文注释

# 从配置文件中读取关键词搜索相关的帖子并爬取帖子信息与评论
uv run main.py --platform xhs --lt qrcode --type search

# 从配置文件中读取指定的帖子ID列表获取指定帖子的信息与评论信息
uv run main.py --platform xhs --lt qrcode --type detail

# 打开对应APP扫二维码登录

# 其他平台爬虫使用示例，执行下面的命令查看
uv run main.py --help
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🔗 &lt;strong&gt;使用 Python 原生 venv 管理环境（不推荐）&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

#### 创建并激活 Python 虚拟环境

&gt; 如果是爬取抖音和知乎，需要提前安装 nodejs 环境，版本大于等于：`16` 即可

```shell
# 进入项目根目录
cd MediaCrawler

# 创建虚拟环境
# 我的 python 版本是：3.9.6，requirements.txt 中的库是基于这个版本的
# 如果是其他 python 版本，可能 requirements.txt 中的库不兼容，需自行解决
python -m venv venv

# macOS &amp; Linux 激活虚拟环境
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows 激活虚拟环境
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 安装依赖库

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 安装 playwright 浏览器驱动

```shell
playwright install
```

#### 运行爬虫程序（原生环境）

```shell
# 项目默认是没有开启评论爬取模式，如需评论请在 config/base_config.py 中的 ENABLE_GET_COMMENTS 变量修改
# 一些其他支持项，也可以在 config/base_config.py 查看功能，写的有中文注释

# 从配置文件中读取关键词搜索相关的帖子并爬取帖子信息与评论
python main.py --platform xhs --lt qrcode --type search

# 从配置文件中读取指定的帖子ID列表获取指定帖子的信息与评论信息
python main.py --platform xhs --lt qrcode --type detail

# 打开对应APP扫二维码登录

# 其他平台爬虫使用示例，执行下面的命令查看
python main.py --help
```

&lt;/details&gt;
