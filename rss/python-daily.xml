            <h2>README</h2><pre># Review Prompts for AI-Assisted Code Review

AI-assisted code review prompts for Linux kernel and systemd development.
Works with Claude Code and other AI tools.

## Quick Start

### Install Kernel Prompts Only

```bash
cd kernel/scripts
./claude-setup.sh
```

### Install systemd Prompts Only

```bash
cd systemd/scripts
./claude-setup.sh
```

### Install Both

```bash
cd kernel/scripts &amp;&amp; ./claude-setup.sh
cd ../systemd/scripts &amp;&amp; ./claude-setup.sh
```

## Available Commands

| Project | Review | Debug | Verify |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Kernel  | `/kreview` | `/kdebug` | `/kverify` |
| systemd | `/systemd-review` | `/systemd-debug` | `/systemd-verify` |

## Project Documentation

- [Kernel Review Prompts](kernel/README.md) - Linux kernel specific patterns and protocols
- [systemd Review Prompts](systemd/README.md) - systemd specific patterns and protocols

## How It Works

Each project has:
- **Skill file** - Automatically loads context when working in the project tree
- **Slash commands** - Quick access to review, debug, and verify workflows
- **Subsystem files** - Domain-specific knowledge loaded on demand

The skills detect your working directory and load appropriate context:
- In a kernel tree: kernel skill loads automatically
- In a systemd tree: systemd skill loads automatically

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Agent Skills

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to perform at specific tasks. Write once, use everywhere.

Codex uses skills to help package capabilities that teams and individuals can use to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way. This repository catalogs skills for use and distribution with Codex.

Learn more:
- [Using skills in Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills)
- [Create custom skills in Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/create-skill)
- [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io)

## Installing a skill

Skills in [`.system`](skills/.system/) are automatically installed in the latest version of Codex.

To install [curated](skills/.curated/) or [experimental](skills/.experimental/) skills, you can use the `$skill-installer` inside Codex.

Curated skills can be installed by name (defaults to `skills/.curated`):

```
$skill-installer gh-address-comments
```

For experimental skills, specify the skill folder. For example:

```
$skill-installer install the create-plan skill from the .experimental folder
```

Or provide the GitHub directory URL:

```
$skill-installer install https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.experimental/create-plan
```

After installing a skill, restart Codex to pick up new skills.

## License

The license of an individual skill can be found directly inside the skill&#039;s directory inside the `LICENSE.txt` file.

![nanochat logo](dev/nanochat.png)
![scaling laws](dev/scaling_laws_jan26.png)

nanochat is the simplest experimental harness for training LLMs. It is designed to run on a single GPU node, the code is minimal/hackable, and it covers all major LLM stages including tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and a chat UI. For example, you can train your own GPT-2 capability LLM (which cost ~$50,000 to train in 2019) for only $73 (3 hours of 8XH100 GPU node) and then talk to it in a familiar ChatGPT-like web UI.

For questions about the repo, I recommend either using [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/karpathy/nanochat) from Devin/Cognition to ask questions about the repo, or use the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions), or come by the [#nanochat](https://discord.com/channels/1020383067459821711/1427295580895314031) channel on Discord.

## Updates

- (Jan 31 2026) Major revamp of all scripts/README ongoing, deleting midtraining stage, might be a bit messy briefly...
- (Jan 30 2026) With all the latest improvements we&#039;re able to train GPT-2 grade LLM in about $73. The [runs/speedrun.sh](runs/speedrun.sh) script will become the refernece way to train GPT-2 grade model and talk to it.

## Leaderboard

| # | time | val_bpb | CORE | Description | Date | Commit | Contributors |
|---|-------------|---------|------|-------------|------|--------|--------------|
| 0 | 168 hours | - | 0.2565 | Original OpenAI GPT-2 checkpoint | 2019 | - | OpenAI |
| 1 | 3.04 | 0.74833 | 0.2585 | d24 baseline, slightly overtrained | Jan 29 2026 | 348fbb3 | @karpathy |
| 2 | 2.91 | 0.74504 | 0.2578 | d26 slightly undertrained **+fp8** | Feb 2 2026 | 8309b83 | @karpathy |

The primary metric we care about is &quot;time to GPT-2&quot; - the wall clock time needed to outperform the GPT-2 (1.6B) CORE metric on an 8XH100 GPU node. The GPT-2 CORE score is 0.256525. In 2019, the training of GPT-2 cost approximately $50,000 so it is incredible that due to many advances over 7 years across the stack, we can now do so much faster and for well below $100 (e.g. at the current ~$3/GPU/hr, an 8XH100 node is ~$24/hr, so 3 hours is ~$72).

See [dev/LEADERBOARD.md](dev/LEADERBOARD.md) for more docs on how to interpret and contribute to the leaderboard.

## Getting started

### Reproduce and talk to GPT-2

The most fun you can have is to train your own GPT-2 and talk to it. The entire pipeline to do so is contained in the single file [runs/speedrun.sh](runs/speedrun.sh), which is designed to be run on an 8XH100 GPU node. Currently, at ~$24/hour for these nodes, pretraining GPT-2 grade model takes approximately 3 hours and will set you back about $75. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like [Lambda](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)), and kick off the training script:

```bash
bash runs/speedrun.sh
```

You mish to do so in a screen session as this will take ~3 hours to run. Once it&#039;s done, you can talk to it via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run `source .venv/bin/activate`), and serve it:

```bash
python -m scripts.chat_web
```

And then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you&#039;re on, followed by the port, so for example [http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/](http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/), etc. Then talk to your LLM as you&#039;d normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it&#039;s green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it&#039;s a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).

---

A few more notes:

- The code will run just fine on the Ampere 8XA100 GPU node as well, but a bit slower.
- All code will run just fine on even a single GPU by omitting `torchrun`, and will produce ~identical results (code will automatically switch to gradient accumulation), but you&#039;ll have to wait 8 times longer.
- If your GPU(s) have less than 80GB, you&#039;ll have to tune some of the hyperparameters or you will OOM / run out of VRAM. Look for `--device_batch_size` in the scripts and reduce it until things fit. E.g. from 32 (default) to 16, 8, 4, 2, or even 1. Less than that you&#039;ll have to know a bit more what you&#039;re doing and get more creative.
- Most of the code is fairly vanilla PyTorch so it should run on anything that supports that - xpu, mps, or etc, but I haven&#039;t personally exercised all of these code paths so there might be sharp edges.

## Research

If you are a researcher and wish to help improve nanochat, two scripts of interest are [runs/scaling_laws.sh](runs/scaling_laws.sh) and [runs/miniseries.sh](runs/miniseries.sh). See [Jan 7 miniseries v1](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/420) for related documentation. For quick experimentation (~5 min pretraining runs) my favorite scale is to train a 12-layer model (GPT-1 sized), e.g. like this:

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- \
    --depth=12 \
    --run=&quot;d12&quot; \
    --model-tag=&quot;d12&quot; \
    --core-metric-every=999999 \
    --sample-every=-1 \
    --save-every=-1 \
```

This uses wandb (run name &quot;d12&quot;), only runs the CORE metric on last step, and it doesn&#039;t sample and save intermediate checkpoints. I like to change something in the code, re-run a d12 (or a d16 etc) and see if it helped, in an iteration loop.

The overall approach is to treat the depth of the model as the single dial of complexity. By sweeping out the depth, we get increasingly more powerful models. We determine the scaling laws, set the data budget to a compute optimal setting, train a whole miniseries of models of increasing sizes, and compare them to the GPT-2 and GPT-3 miniseries. Right now, beating GPT-2 specifically faster and faster is the most interesting target.

## Running on CPU / MPS

The script [runs/runcpu.sh](runs/runcpu.sh) shows a very simple example of running on CPU or Apple Silicon. It dramatically shrinks the LLM tha tis being trained to make things fit into a reasonable time interval of a few ten minutes of training. You will not get strong results in this way.

## Guides

I&#039;ve published a number of guides that might contain helpful information:

- [Oct 13 2025 original nanochat post](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1) introducing nanochat, though now it contains some deprecated information and the model is a lot older (with worse results) than current master.
- [Jan 7 miniseries v1](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/420) documents the first nanochat miniseries of models.
- To customize your nanochat, see [Guide: infusing identity to your nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/139) in Discussions, which describes how you can tune your nanochat&#039;s personality through synthetic data generation and mixing that data into the SFT stage.
- To add new abilities to nanochat, see [Guide: counting r in strawberry (and how to add abilities generally)](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/164).

## Contributing

The goal of nanochat is to improve the state of the art in micro models that are accessible to work with end to end on budgets of &lt; $1000 dollars. Accessibility is about overall cost but also about cognitive complexity - nanochat is not an exhaustively configurable LLM &quot;framework&quot;; there are no giant configuration objects, model factories, or if-then-else monsters in the code base. It is a single, cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally-forkable &quot;strong baseline&quot; codebase designed to run start to end and produce a ChatGPT model you can talk to. Currently, the most interesting part personally is speeding up the latency to GPT-2 (i.e. getting a CORE score above 0.256525). Currently this takes ~3 hours, but by improving the pretraining stage we can improve this further.

Current AI policy: disclosure. When submitting a PR, please declare any parts that had substantial LLM contribution and that you have not written or that you do not fully understand.

&lt;/p&gt;

## 📖 Overview
ChatDev has evolved from a specialized software development multi-agent system into a comprehensive multi-agent orchestration platform.

- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/main&quot;&gt;**ChatDev 2.0 (DevAll)**&lt;/a&gt; is a **Zero-Code Multi-Agent Platform** for &quot;Developing Everything&quot;. It empowers users to rapidly build and execute customized multi-agent systems through simple configuration. No coding is required—users can define agents, workflows, and tasks to orchestrate complex scenarios such as data visualization, 3D generation, and deep research.
- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/chatdev1.0&quot;&gt;**ChatDev 1.0 (Legacy)**&lt;/a&gt; operates as a **Virtual Software Company**. It utilizes various intelligent agents (e.g., CEO, CTO, Programmer) participating in specialized functional seminars to automate the entire software development life cycle—including designing, coding, testing, and documenting. It serves as the foundational paradigm for communicative agent collaboration.

## 🎉 News
• **Jan 07, 2026: 🚀 We are excited to announce the official release of ChatDev 2.0 (DevAll)!** This version introduces a zero-code multi-agent orchestration platform. The classic ChatDev (v1.x) has been moved to the [`chatdev1.0`](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/chatdev1.0) branch for maintenance. More details about ChatDev 2.0 can be found on [our official post](https://x.com/OpenBMB/status/2008916790399701335).

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Old News&lt;/summary&gt;

•Sep 24, 2025: 🎉 Our paper [Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19591) has been accepted to NeurIPS 2025. The implementation is available in the `puppeteer` branch of this repository.

•May 26, 2025: 🎉 We propose a novel puppeteer-style paradigm for multi-agent collaboration among large language model based agents. By leveraging a learnable central orchestrator optimized with reinforcement learning, our method dynamically activates and sequences agents to construct efficient, context-aware reasoning paths. This approach not only improves reasoning quality but also reduces computational costs, enabling scalable and adaptable multi-agent cooperation in complex tasks.
See our paper in [Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19591).

  &lt;/p&gt;

•June 25, 2024: 🎉To foster development in LLM-powered multi-agent collaboration🤖🤖 and related fields, the ChatDev team has curated a collection of seminal papers📄 presented in a [open-source](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/main/MultiAgentEbook) interactive e-book📚 format. Now you can explore the latest advancements on the [Ebook Website](https://thinkwee.top/multiagent_ebook) and download the [paper list](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/blob/main/MultiAgentEbook/papers.csv).
  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#039;./assets/ebook.png&#039; width=800&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
•June 12, 2024: We introduced Multi-Agent Collaboration Networks (MacNet) 🎉, which utilize directed acyclic graphs to facilitate effective task-oriented collaboration among agents through linguistic interactions 🤖🤖. MacNet supports co-operation across various topologies and among more than a thousand agents without exceeding context limits. More versatile and scalable, MacNet can be considered as a more advanced version of ChatDev&#039;s chain-shaped topology. Our preprint paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155). This technique has been incorporated into the [macnet](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/macnet) branch, enhancing support for diverse organizational structures and offering richer solutions beyond software development (e.g., logical reasoning, data analysis, story generation, and more).
  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#039;./assets/macnet.png&#039; width=500&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

• May 07, 2024, we introduced &quot;Iterative Experience Refinement&quot; (IER), a novel method where instructor and assistant agents enhance shortcut-oriented experiences to efficiently adapt to new tasks. This approach encompasses experience acquisition, utilization, propagation and elimination across a series of tasks and making the pricess shorter and efficient. Our preprint paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04219, and this technique will soon be incorporated into ChatDev.
  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#039;./assets/ier.png&#039; width=220&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

• January 25, 2024: We have integrated Experiential Co-Learning Module into ChatDev. Please see the [Experiential Co-Learning Guide](wiki.md#co-tracking).

• December 28, 2023: We present Experiential Co-Learning, an innovative approach where instructor and assistant agents accumulate shortcut-oriented experiences to effectively solve new tasks, reducing repetitive errors and enhancing efficiency.  Check out our preprint paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17025 and this technique will soon be integrated into ChatDev.
  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#039;./assets/ecl.png&#039; width=860&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

*   **OS**: macOS / Linux / WSL / Windows
*   **Python**: 3.12+
*   **Node.js**: 18+
*   **Package Manager**: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### 📦 Installation

1.  **Backend Dependencies** (Python managed by `uv`):
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

2.  **Frontend Dependencies** (Vite + Vue 3):
    ```bash
    cd frontend &amp;&amp; npm install
    ```

### ⚡️ Run the Application

1.  **Start Backend** :
    ```bash
    # Run from the project root
    uv run python server_main.py --port 6400 --reload
    ```
    &gt; Remove `--reload` if output files (e.g., GameDev) trigger restarts, which interrupts tasks and loses progress.

2.  **Start Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:6400 npm run dev
    ```
    &gt; Then access the Web Console at **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**. 
    
    
    &gt; **💡 Tip**: If the frontend fails to connect to the backend, the default port `6400` may already be occupied.
    &gt; Please switch both services to an available port, for example:
    &gt;
    &gt; * **Backend**: start with `--port 6401`
    &gt; * **Frontend**: set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:6401`


### 🔑 Configuration

*   **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root.
*   **Model Keys**: Set `API_KEY` and `BASE_URL` in `.env` for your LLM provider.
*   **YAML placeholders**: Use `${VAR}`（e.g., `${API_KEY}`）in configuration files to reference these variables.

## 💡 How to Use

### 🖥️ Web Console

The DevAll interface provides a seamless experience for both construction and execution

*   **Tutorial**: Comprehensive step-by-step guides and documentation integrated directly into the platform to help you get started quickly.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/tutorial-en.png&quot;/&gt; 

*   **Workflow**: A visual canvas to design your multi-agent systems. Configure node parameters, define context flows, and orchestrate complex agent interactions with drag-and-drop ease.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/workflow.gif&quot;/&gt;

*   **Launch**: Initiate workflows, monitor real-time logs, inspect intermediate artifacts, and provide human-in-the-loop feedback.
&lt;img src=&quot;assets/launch.gif&quot;/&gt;

### 🧰 Python SDK
For automation and batch processing, use our lightweight Python SDK to execute workflows programmatically and retrieve results directly.

```python
from runtime.sdk import run_workflow

# Execute a workflow and get the final node message
result = run_workflow(
    yaml_file=&quot;yaml_instance/demo.yaml&quot;,
    task_prompt=&quot;Summarize the attached document in one sentence.&quot;,
    attachments=[&quot;/path/to/document.pdf&quot;],
    variables={&quot;API_KEY&quot;: &quot;sk-xxxx&quot;} # Override .env variables if needed
)

if result.final_message:
    print(f&quot;Output: {result.final_message.text_content()}&quot;)
```

## ⚙️ For Developers

**For secondary development and extensions, please proceed with this section.**

Extend DevAll with new nodes, providers, and tools.
The project is organized into a modular structure:
*   **Core Systems**: `server/` hosts the FastAPI backend, while `runtime/` manages agent abstraction and tool execution.
*   **Orchestration**: `workflow/` handles the multi-agent logic, driven by configurations in `entity/`.
*   **Frontend**: `frontend/` contains the Vue 3 Web Console.
*   **Extensibility**: `functions/` is the place for custom Python tools.

Relevant reference documentation:
*   **Getting Started**: [Start Guide](./docs/user_guide/en/index.md)
*   **Core Modules**: [Workflow Authoring](./docs/user_guide/en/workflow_authoring.md), [Memory](./docs/user_guide/en/modules/memory.md), and [Tooling](./docs/user_guide/en/modules/tooling/index.md)

## Intro

This list was originally a clone of [StackOverflow - List of Freely Available Programming Books](https://web.archive.org/web/20140606191453/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books/392926) with contributions from Karan Bhangui and George Stocker.

The list was moved to GitHub by Victor Felder for collaborative updating and maintenance. It has grown to become one of [GitHub&#039;s most popular repositories](https://octoverse.github.com/).

&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;📢 Latest Updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

 **🔥 Releases:**
- [**PageIndex Chat**](https://chat.pageindex.ai): The first human-like document-analysis agent [platform](https://chat.pageindex.ai) built for professional long documents. Can also be integrated via [MCP](https://pageindex.ai/mcp) or [API](https://docs.pageindex.ai/quickstart) (beta).
&lt;!-- - [**PageIndex Chat API**](https://docs.pageindex.ai/quickstart): An API that brings PageIndex&#039;s advanced long-document intelligence directly into your applications and workflows. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - [PageIndex MCP](https://pageindex.ai/mcp): Bring PageIndex into Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-enabled agent. Chat with long PDFs in a reasoning-based, human-like way. --&gt;
 
 **📝 Articles:**
- [**PageIndex Framework**](https://pageindex.ai/blog/pageindex-intro): Introduces the PageIndex framework — an *agentic, in-context* *tree index* that enables LLMs to perform *reasoning-based*, *human-like retrieval* over long documents, without vector DB or chunking.
&lt;!-- - [Do We Still Need OCR?](https://pageindex.ai/blog/do-we-need-ocr): Explores how vision-based, reasoning-native RAG challenges the traditional OCR pipeline, and why the future of document AI might be *vectorless* and *vision-based*. --&gt;

 **🧪 Cookbooks:**
- [Vectorless RAG](https://docs.pageindex.ai/cookbook/vectorless-rag-pageindex): A minimal, hands-on example of reasoning-based RAG using PageIndex. No vectors, no chunking, and human-like retrieval.
- [Vision-based Vectorless RAG](https://docs.pageindex.ai/cookbook/vision-rag-pageindex): OCR-free, vision-only RAG with PageIndex&#039;s reasoning-native retrieval workflow that works directly over PDF page images.
&lt;/details&gt;

# 📑 Introduction to PageIndex

Are you frustrated with vector database retrieval accuracy for long professional documents? Traditional vector-based RAG relies on semantic *similarity* rather than true *relevance*. But **similarity ≠ relevance** — what we truly need in retrieval is **relevance**, and that requires **reasoning**. When working with professional documents that demand domain expertise and multi-step reasoning, similarity search often falls short.

Inspired by AlphaGo, we propose **[PageIndex](https://vectify.ai/pageindex)** — a **vectorless**, **reasoning-based RAG** system that builds a **hierarchical tree index** from long documents and uses LLMs to **reason** *over that index* for **agentic, context-aware retrieval**.
It simulates how *human experts* navigate and extract knowledge from complex documents through *tree search*, enabling LLMs to *think* and *reason* their way to the most relevant document sections. PageIndex performs retrieval in two steps:

1. Generate a “Table-of-Contents” **tree structure index** of documents
2. Perform reasoning-based retrieval through **tree search**

### 🎯 Core Features 

Compared to traditional vector-based RAG, **PageIndex** features:
- **No Vector DB**: Uses document structure and LLM reasoning for retrieval, instead of vector similarity search.
- **No Chunking**: Documents are organized into natural sections, not artificial chunks.
- **Human-like Retrieval**: Simulates how human experts navigate and extract knowledge from complex documents.
- **Better Explainability and Traceability**: Retrieval is based on reasoning — traceable and interpretable, with page and section references. No more opaque, approximate vector search (“vibe retrieval”).

PageIndex powers a reasoning-based RAG system that achieved **state-of-the-art** [98.7% accuracy](https://github.com/VectifyAI/Mafin2.5-FinanceBench) on FinanceBench, demonstrating superior performance over vector-based RAG solutions in professional document analysis (see our [blog post](https://vectify.ai/blog/Mafin2.5) for details).

# 🌲 PageIndex Tree Structure
PageIndex can transform lengthy PDF documents into a semantic **tree structure**, similar to a _&quot;table of contents&quot;_ but optimized for use with Large Language Models (LLMs). It&#039;s ideal for: financial reports, regulatory filings, academic textbooks, legal or technical manuals, and any document that exceeds LLM context limits.

Below is an example PageIndex tree structure. Also see more example [documents](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/tree/main/tests/pdfs) and generated [tree structures](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/tree/main/tests/results).

```jsonc
...
{
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Financial Stability&quot;,
  &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;0006&quot;,
  &quot;start_index&quot;: 21,
  &quot;end_index&quot;: 22,
  &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Federal Reserve ...&quot;,
  &quot;nodes&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Monitoring Financial Vulnerabilities&quot;,
      &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;0007&quot;,
      &quot;start_index&quot;: 22,
      &quot;end_index&quot;: 28,
      &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Federal Reserve&#039;s monitoring ...&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Domestic and International Cooperation and Coordination&quot;,
      &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;0008&quot;,
      &quot;start_index&quot;: 28,
      &quot;end_index&quot;: 31,
      &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;In 2023, the Federal Reserve collaborated ...&quot;
    }
  ]
}
...
```

You can generate the PageIndex tree structure with this open-source repo, or use our [API](https://docs.pageindex.ai/quickstart)

# ⚙️ Package Usage

You can follow these steps to generate a PageIndex tree from a PDF document.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set your OpenAI API key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```bash
CHATGPT_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 3. Run PageIndex on your PDF

```bash
python3 run_pageindex.py --pdf_path /path/to/your/document.pdf
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional parameters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can customize the processing with additional optional arguments:

```
--model                 OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4o-2024-11-20)
--toc-check-pages       Pages to check for table of contents (default: 20)
--max-pages-per-node    Max pages per node (default: 10)
--max-tokens-per-node   Max tokens per node (default: 20000)
--if-add-node-id        Add node ID (yes/no, default: yes)
--if-add-node-summary   Add node summary (yes/no, default: yes)
--if-add-doc-description Add doc description (yes/no, default: yes)
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markdown support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We also provide markdown support for PageIndex. You can use the `-md_path` flag to generate a tree structure for a markdown file.

```bash
python3 run_pageindex.py --md_path /path/to/your/document.md
```

&gt; Note: in this function, we use &quot;#&quot; to determine node heading and their levels. For example, &quot;##&quot; is level 2, &quot;###&quot; is level 3, etc. Make sure your markdown file is formatted correctly. If your Markdown file was converted from a PDF or HTML, we don&#039;t recommend using this function, since most existing conversion tools cannot preserve the original hierarchy. Instead, use our [PageIndex OCR](https://pageindex.ai/blog/ocr), which is designed to preserve the original hierarchy, to convert the PDF to a markdown file and then use this function.
&lt;/details&gt;

# ☁️ Improved Tree Generation with PageIndex OCR

This repo is designed for generating PageIndex tree structure for simple PDFs, but many real-world use cases involve complex PDFs that are hard to parse by classic Python tools. However, extracting high-quality text from PDF documents remains a non-trivial challenge. Most OCR tools only extract page-level content, losing the broader document context and hierarchy.

To address this, we introduced PageIndex OCR — the first long-context OCR model designed to preserve the global structure of documents. PageIndex OCR significantly outperforms other leading OCR tools, such as those from Mistral and Contextual AI, in recognizing true hierarchy and semantic relationships across document pages.

- Experience next-level OCR quality with PageIndex OCR at our [Dashboard](https://dash.pageindex.ai/).
- Integrate PageIndex OCR seamlessly into your stack via our [API](https://docs.pageindex.ai/quickstart).

## Why This Repository?

We created this repository out of admiration for Claude Code - **what we believe to be the most capable AI coding agent in the world**. Initially, we attempted to reverse-engineer its design through behavioral observation and speculation. The analysis we published was riddled with inaccuracies, unfounded guesses, and technical errors. We deeply apologize to the Claude Code team and anyone who was misled by that content.

Over the past six months, through building and iterating on real agent systems, our understanding of **&quot;what makes a true AI agent&quot;** has been fundamentally reshaped. We&#039;d like to share these insights with you. All previous speculative content has been removed and replaced with original educational material.

---

&gt; Works with **[Kode CLI](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/Kode)**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and any agent supporting the [Agent Skills Spec](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## What You&#039;ll Learn

After completing this tutorial, you will understand:

- **The Agent Loop** - The surprisingly simple pattern behind all AI coding agents
- **Tool Design** - How to give AI models the ability to interact with the real world
- **Explicit Planning** - Using constraints to make AI behavior predictable
- **Context Management** - Keeping agent memory clean through subagent isolation
- **Knowledge Injection** - Loading domain expertise on-demand without retraining

## Learning Path

```
Start Here
    |
    v
[v0: Bash Agent] -----&gt; &quot;One tool is enough&quot;
    |                    16-50 lines
    v
[v1: Basic Agent] ----&gt; &quot;The complete agent pattern&quot;
    |                    4 tools, ~200 lines
    v
[v2: Todo Agent] -----&gt; &quot;Make plans explicit&quot;
    |                    +TodoManager, ~300 lines
    v
[v3: Subagent] -------&gt; &quot;Divide and conquer&quot;
    |                    +Task tool, ~450 lines
    v
[v4: Skills Agent] ---&gt; &quot;Domain expertise on-demand&quot;
                         +Skill tool, ~550 lines
```

**Recommended approach:**
1. Read and run v0 first - understand the core loop
2. Compare v0 and v1 - see how tools evolve
3. Study v2 for planning patterns
4. Explore v3 for complex task decomposition
5. Master v4 for building extensible agents

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code
cd learn-claude-code

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Run any version
python v0_bash_agent.py      # Minimal (start here!)
python v1_basic_agent.py     # Core agent loop
python v2_todo_agent.py      # + Todo planning
python v3_subagent.py        # + Subagents
python v4_skills_agent.py    # + Skills
```

## The Core Pattern

Every coding agent is just this loop:

```python
while True:
    response = model(messages, tools)
    if response.stop_reason != &quot;tool_use&quot;:
        return response.text
    results = execute(response.tool_calls)
    messages.append(results)
```

That&#039;s it. The model calls tools until done. Everything else is refinement.

## Version Comparison

| Version | Lines | Tools | Core Addition | Key Insight |
|---------|-------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| [v0](./v0_bash_agent.py) | ~50 | bash | Recursive subagents | One tool is enough |
| [v1](./v1_basic_agent.py) | ~200 | bash, read, write, edit | Core loop | Model as Agent |
| [v2](./v2_todo_agent.py) | ~300 | +TodoWrite | Explicit planning | Constraints enable complexity |
| [v3](./v3_subagent.py) | ~450 | +Task | Context isolation | Clean context = better results |
| [v4](./v4_skills_agent.py) | ~550 | +Skill | Knowledge loading | Expertise without retraining |

## Philosophy

&gt; **The model is 80%. Code is 20%.**

Modern agents like Kode and Claude Code work not because of clever engineering, but because the model is trained to be an agent. Our job is to give it tools and stay out of the way.

# 📌 Introduction

大语言模型（Large Language Model, LLM）的出现引发了全世界对AI的空前关注。
无论是ChatGPT、DeepSeek还是Qwen，都以其惊艳的效果令人叹为观止。
然而，动辄数百亿参数的庞大规模，使得它们对个人设备而言不仅难以训练，甚至连部署都显得遥不可及。
打开大模型的“黑盒子”，探索其内部运作机制，多么令人心潮澎湃！
遗憾的是，99%的探索只能止步于使用LoRA等技术对现有大模型进行少量微调，学习一些新指令或任务。
这就好比教牛顿如何使用21世纪的智能手机——虽然有趣，却完全偏离了理解物理本质的初衷。
与此同时，第三方的大模型框架和工具库，如transformers+trl，几乎只暴露了高度抽象的接口。
通过短短10行代码，就能完成“加载模型+加载数据集+推理+强化学习”的全流程训练。
这种高效的封装固然便利，但也像一架高速飞船，将开发者与底层实现隔离开来，阻碍了深入探究LLM核心代码的机会。
然而，“用乐高拼出一架飞机，远比坐在头等舱里飞行更让人兴奋！”。
更糟糕的是，互联网上充斥着大量付费课程和营销号，以漏洞百出、一知半解的内容推销AI教程。
正因如此，本项目初衷是拉低LLM的学习门槛，让每个人都能从理解每一行代码开始，
从零开始亲手训练一个极小的语言模型。是的，从**零开始训练**，而不是仅仅进行**推理**！
最低只需3块钱不到的服务器成本，就能亲身体验从0到1构建一个语言模型的全过程。
一起感受创造的乐趣吧！

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; （截至2025-10）MiniMind系列已完成多个型号模型的预训练，最小仅需25.8M（0.02B），即可具备流畅对话能力！

### 👉**更新日志**

&lt;details close&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt; &lt;b&gt;2025-10-24&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/summary&gt;

- 🔥 新增RLAIF训练算法：PPO、GRPO、SPO（从0原生实现）
- 新增断点续训功能：支持训练自动恢复、跨GPU数量恢复、wandb记录连续性
- 新增RLAIF数据集：rlaif-mini.jsonl（从SFT数据随机采样1万条）；简化DPO数据集，加入中文数据
- 新增YaRN算法：支持RoPE长文本外推，提升长序列处理能力
- Adaptive Thinking：Reason模型可选是否启用思考链

- 新增RLAIF完整章节、训练曲线对比、算法原理折叠说明
- [SwanLab](https://swanlab.cn/)替代WandB（国内访问友好，API完全兼容）
- 规范化所有代码 &amp; 修复一些已知bugs

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details close&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt; &lt;b&gt;2025-04-26&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/summary&gt;

- 重要更新
- 如有兼容性需要，可访问[🔗旧仓库内容🔗](https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind/tree/7da201a944a90ed49daef8a0265c959288dff83a)。
- MiniMind模型参数完全改名，对齐Transformers库模型（统一命名）。
- generate方式重构，继承自GenerationMixin类。
- 🔥支持llama.cpp、vllm、ollama等热门三方生态。
- 规范代码和目录结构。
- 改动词表`&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;`-&gt;`&lt;|im_start|&gt;&lt;|im_end|&gt;`

```text
为兼容第三方推理框架llama.cpp、vllm，本次更新需付出一些可观代价。
本次更新不再支持「直接」加载25-04-26以前的旧模型进行推理。
由于Llama位置编码方式与minimind存在区别，导致映射Llama模型后QK值存在差异
MiniMind2系列旧模型均经过权重映射+（微调训练）QKVO线性层校准恢复而来。
本次更新后将放弃对`minimind-v1`全系列的维护，并在仓库中下线。
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Ⅱ 从0开始自己训练

### 1.环境准备

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple
```

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;注：提前测试Torch是否可用cuda&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

如果不可用，请自行去[torch_stable](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html)
下载whl文件安装。参考[链接](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45456738/article/details/141029610?ops_request_misc=&amp;request_id=&amp;biz_id=102&amp;utm_term=%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85torch&amp;utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduweb~default-2-141029610.nonecase&amp;spm=1018.2226.3001.4187)

&lt;/details&gt;

### 2.数据下载

从下文提供的[数据集下载链接](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/gongjy/minimind_dataset/files)
下载需要的数据文件（创建`./dataset`目录）并放到`./dataset`下

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;注：数据集须知&lt;/summary&gt;

默认推荐下载`pretrain_hq.jsonl` + `sft_mini_512.jsonl`最快速度复现Zero聊天模型。

数据文件可自由选择，下文提供了多种搭配方案，可根据自己手头的训练需求和GPU资源进行适当组合。

&lt;/details&gt;

### 3.开始训练

目录位于`trainer`

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;💡 检查点暂停续训&lt;/summary&gt;

所有训练脚本均自动保存检查点，只需添加 `--from_resume 1` 参数即可自动检测加载&amp;恢复训练：

```bash
python train_pretrain.py --from_resume 1
python train_full_sft.py --from_resume 1
...
```

**断点续训机制说明：**
- 训练过程自动在 `./checkpoints/` 目录保存完整检查点（模型、优化器、训练进度等）
- 检查点文件命名：`&lt;权重名&gt;_&lt;维度&gt;_resume.pth`（如：`full_sft_512_resume.pth`）
- 支持跨不同GPU数量恢复（自动调整step）
- 支持wandb训练记录连续性（自动恢复同一个run）

&gt; 适合长时间训练或不稳定环境，无需担心训练中断导致进度丢失

&lt;/details&gt;

**3.1 预训练（学知识）**

```bash
python train_pretrain.py
```

&gt; 执行预训练，得到 `pretrain_*.pth` 作为预训练的输出权重（其中*为模型的dimension，默认为512）


**3.2 监督微调（学对话方式）**

```bash
python train_full_sft.py
```

&gt; 执行监督微调，得到 `full_sft_*.pth` 作为指令微调的输出权重（其中`full`即为全参数微调）

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;注：训练须知&lt;/summary&gt;

所有训练过程默认每隔100步保存1次参数到文件`./out/***.pth`（每次会覆盖掉旧权重文件）。

简单起见，此处只写明两个阶段训练过程。如需其它训练 (LoRA, 蒸馏, 强化学习, 微调推理等) 可参考下文【实验】小节的详细说明。

&lt;/details&gt;


---

### 4.测试自己训练的模型效果

确保需要测试的模型`*.pth`文件位于`./out/`目录下。
也可以直接去[此处](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/gongjy/MiniMind2-PyTorch/files)下载使用我训练的`*.pth`文件。

```bash
python eval_llm.py --weight full_sft # 或 pretrain/dpo/ppo/grpo...
```

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;注：测试须知&lt;/summary&gt;

`--weight` 参数指定权重名称前缀，可选：`pretrain`, `full_sft`, `dpo`, `reason`, `ppo_actor`, `grpo`, `spo` 等

其他常用参数：
- `--load_from`: 模型加载路径（`model`=原生torch权重，其他路径=transformers格式）
- `--save_dir`: 模型权重目录（默认`out`）
- `--lora_weight`: LoRA权重名称（`None`表示不使用）
- `--historys`: 携带历史对话轮数（需为偶数，0表示不携带历史）
- `--max_new_tokens`: 最大生成长度（默认8192）
- `--temperature`: 生成温度（默认0.85）
- `--top_p`: nucleus采样阈值（默认0.85）


使用方式直接查看`eval_llm.py`代码即可。

&lt;/details&gt;


---

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 所有训练脚本均为Pytorch原生框架，均支持多卡加速，假设你的设备有N (N＞1) 张显卡：

单机N卡启动训练方式 (DDP, 支持多机多卡集群)

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_xxx.py
```

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;注：其它须知&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;del&gt;
单机N卡启动训练 (DeepSpeed)

```bash
deepspeed --master_port 29500 --num_gpus=N train_xxx.py
```
&lt;/del&gt;

可根据需要开启wandb记录训练过程（需可直连）

```bash
# 需要登录: wandb login
torchrun --nproc_per_node N train_xxx.py --use_wandb
# and
python train_xxx.py --use_wandb
```

通过添加`--use_wandb`参数，可以记录训练过程，训练完成后，可以在wandb网站上查看训练过程。通过修改`wandb_project`
和`wandb_run_name`参数，可以指定项目名称和运行名称。

【注】：25年6月后，国内网络环境无法直连WandB，MiniMind项目默认转为使用[SwanLab](https://swanlab.cn/)作为训练可视化工具（完全兼容WandB API），即`import wandb`改为`import swanlab as wandb`即可，其他均无需改动。

&lt;/details&gt;

# 📌 数据介绍

## Ⅰ Tokenizer

分词器将单词从自然语言通过“词典”映射到`0, 1, 36`这样的数字，可以理解为数字就代表了单词在“词典”中的页码。
可以选择自己构造词表训练一个“词典”，代码可见`./trainer/train_tokenizer.py`（仅供学习参考，若非必要无需再自行训练，MiniMind已自带tokenizer）。
或者选择比较出名的开源大模型分词器，
正如同直接用新华/牛津词典的优点是token编码压缩率很好，缺点是页数太多，动辄数十万个词汇短语；
自己训练的分词器，优点是词表长度和内容随意控制，缺点是压缩率很低（例如&quot;hello&quot;也许会被拆分为&quot;h e l l o&quot;
五个独立的token），且生僻词难以覆盖。
“词典”的选择固然很重要，LLM的输出本质上是SoftMax到词典N个词的多分类问题，然后通过“词典”解码到自然语言。
因为MiniMind体积需要严格控制，为了避免模型头重脚轻（词嵌入embedding层参数在LLM占比太高），所以词表长度短短益善。

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tokenizer介绍&lt;/summary&gt;

第三方强大的开源模型例如Yi、qwen、chatglm、mistral、Llama3的tokenizer词表长度如下：

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tokenizer模型&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;词表大小&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;来源&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;yi tokenizer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;64,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;01万物（中国）&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;qwen2 tokenizer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;151,643&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;阿里云（中国）&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;glm tokenizer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;151,329&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;智谱AI（中国）&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;mistral tokenizer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;32,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mistral AI（法国）&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;llama3 tokenizer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;128,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Meta（美国）&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;minimind tokenizer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6,400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;自定义&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&gt; 👉2024-09-17更新：为了防止过去的版本歧义&amp;控制体积，minimind所有模型均使用minimind_tokenizer分词，废弃所有mistral_tokenizer版本。

```
# 一些自言自语
&gt; 尽管minimind_tokenizer长度很小，编解码效率弱于qwen2、glm等中文友好型分词器。
&gt; 但minimind模型选择了自己训练的minimind_tokenizer作为分词器，以保持整体参数轻量，避免编码层和计算层占比失衡，头重脚轻，因为minimind的词表大小只有6400。
&gt; 且minimind在实际测试中没有出现过生僻词汇解码失败的情况，效果良好。
&gt; 由于自定义词表压缩长度到6400，使得LLM总参数量最低只有25.8M。
&gt; 训练数据`pretrain_hq.jsonl`均来自于`匠数大模型数据集`，这部分数据相对次要，如需训练可以自由选择。
```

&lt;/details&gt;

## Ⅱ Pretrain数据

经历了MiniMind-V1的低质量预训练数据，导致模型胡言乱语的教训，`2025-02-05` 之后决定不再采用大规模无监督的数据集做预训练。
进而尝试把[匠数大模型数据集](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/deepctrl/deepctrl-sft-data)的中文部分提取出来，
清洗出字符`&lt;512`长度的大约1.6GB的语料直接拼接成预训练数据 `pretrain_hq.jsonl`，hq即为high
quality（当然也还不算high，提升数据质量无止尽）。

文件`pretrain_hq.jsonl` 数据格式为

```json
{&quot;text&quot;: &quot;如何才能摆脱拖延症？ 治愈拖延症并不容易，但以下建议可能有所帮助...&quot;}
```

## Ⅲ SFT数据

[匠数大模型SFT数据集](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/deepctrl/deepctrl-sft-data)
“是一个完整、格式统一、安全的大模型训练和研究资源。
从网络上的公开数据源收集并整理了大量开源数据集，对其进行了格式统一，数据清洗，
包含10M条数据的中文数据集和包含2M条数据的英文数据集。”
以上是官方介绍，下载文件后的数据总量大约在4B tokens，肯定是适合作为中文大语言模型的SFT数据的。
但是官方提供的数据格式很乱，全部用来sft代价太大。
我将把官方数据集进行了二次清洗，把含有符号污染和噪声的条目去除；另外依然只保留了总长度`&lt;512`
的内容，此阶段希望通过大量对话补充预训练阶段欠缺的知识。
导出文件为`sft_512.jsonl`(~7.5GB)。

[Magpie-SFT数据集](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/Magpie-Align)
收集了~1M条来自Qwen2/2.5的高质量对话，我将这部分数据进一步清洗，把总长度`&lt;2048`的部分导出为`sft_2048.jsonl`(~9GB)。
长度`&lt;1024`的部分导出为`sft_1024.jsonl`(~5.5GB)，用大模型对话数据直接进行sft就属于“黑盒蒸馏”的范畴。

进一步清洗前两步sft的数据（只保留中文字符占比高的内容），筛选长度`&lt;512`的对话，得到`sft_mini_512.jsonl`(~1.2GB)。

所有sft文件 `sft_X.jsonl` 数据格式均为

```text
{
    &quot;conversations&quot;: [
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;你好&quot;},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;你好！&quot;},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;再见&quot;},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;再见！&quot;}
    ]
}
```

## Ⅳ RLHF数据

来自[Magpie-DPO数据集](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Magpie-Align/MagpieLM-DPO-Data-v0.1)
大约200k条偏好数据（均是英文）生成自Llama3.1-70B/8B，可以用于训练奖励模型，优化模型回复质量，使其更加符合人类偏好。
这里将数据总长度`&lt;3000`的内容重组为`dpo.jsonl`(~0.9GB)，包含`chosen`和`rejected`两个字段，`chosen`
为偏好的回复，`rejected`为拒绝的回复。

文件 `dpo.jsonl` 数据格式为

```text
{
  &quot;chosen&quot;: [
    {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;}, 
    {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;good answer&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;}
  ], 
  &quot;rejected&quot;: [
    {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;}, 
    {&quot;content&quot;: &quot;bad answer&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;}
  ]
}
```

## Ⅴ Reason数据集：

不得不说2025年2月谁能火的过DeepSeek...
也激发了我对RL引导的推理模型的浓厚兴趣，目前已经用Qwen2.5复现了R1-Zero。
如果有时间+效果work（但99%基模能力不足）我会在之后更新MiniMind基于RL训练的推理模型而不是蒸馏模型。
时间有限，最快的低成本方案依然是直接蒸馏（黑盒方式）。
耐不住R1太火，短短几天就已经存在一些R1的蒸馏数据集[R1-Llama-70B](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Magpie-Align/Magpie-Reasoning-V2-250K-CoT-Deepseek-R1-Llama-70B)、[R1-Distill-SFT](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/AI-ModelScope/R1-Distill-SFT)、
[Alpaca-Distill-R1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shareAI/Alpaca-Distill-R1-ZH)、
[deepseek_r1_zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinliuxi/deepseek_r1_zh)等等，纯中文的数据可能比较少。
最终整合它们，导出文件为`r1_mix_1024.jsonl`，数据格式和`sft_X.jsonl`一致。

## Ⅵ 更多数据集

目前已经有[HqWu-HITCS/Awesome-Chinese-LLM](https://github.com/HqWu-HITCS/Awesome-Chinese-LLM)
在收集和梳理中文LLM相关的开源模型、应用、数据集及教程等资料，并持续更新这方面的最新进展。全面且专业，Respect！

## Ⅷ MiniMind训练数据集

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 2025-02-05后，开源MiniMind最终训练所用的所有数据集，因此无需再自行预处理大规模数据集，避免重复性的数据处理工作。

MiniMind训练数据集下载地址： [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/gongjy/minimind_dataset/files) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jingyaogong/minimind_dataset/tree/main)

&gt; 无需全部clone，可单独下载所需的文件

将下载的数据集文件放到`./dataset/`目录下（✨为推荐的必须项）

```bash
./dataset/
├── dpo.jsonl (55MB, ✨)
├── lora_identity.jsonl (22.8KB)
├── lora_medical.jsonl (34MB)
├── pretrain_hq.jsonl (1.6GB, ✨)
├── r1_mix_1024.jsonl (340MB)
├── rlaif-mini.jsonl (1MB, ✨)
├── sft_1024.jsonl (5.6GB)
├── sft_2048.jsonl (9GB)
├── sft_512.jsonl (7.5GB)
└── sft_mini_512.jsonl (1.2GB, ✨)
```

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;注：各数据集简介&lt;/summary&gt;

* `dpo.jsonl`✨ --RLHF阶段数据集（已精简优化，适合快速训练）
* `lora_identity.jsonl` --自我认知数据集（例如：你是谁？我是minimind...），推荐用于lora训练（亦可用于全参SFT，勿被名字局限）
* `lora_medical.jsonl` --医疗问答数据集，推荐用于lora训练（亦可用于全参SFT，勿被名字局限）
* `pretrain_hq.jsonl`✨ --预训练数据集，整合自匠数科技（推荐设置`max_seq_len≈320`）
* `r1_mix_1024.jsonl` --DeepSeek-R1-1.5B蒸馏数据，每条数据字符最大长度为1024（推荐设置`max_seq_len≈720`）
* `rlaif-mini.jsonl` --RLAIF训练数据集，从SFT数据集中随机采样1万条高质量对话，用于PPO/GRPO/SPO等强化学习算法训练
* `sft_1024.jsonl` --整合自Qwen2.5蒸馏数据（是sft_2048的子集），每条数据字符最大长度为1024（推荐设置`max_seq_len≈650`）
* `sft_2048.jsonl` --整合自Qwen2.5蒸馏数据，每条数据字符最大长度为2048（推荐设置`max_seq_len≈1400`）
* `sft_512.jsonl` --整合自匠数科技SFT数据，每条数据字符最大长度为512（推荐设置`max_seq_len≈350`）
* `sft_mini_512.jsonl`✨ --极简整合自匠数科技SFT数据+Qwen2.5蒸馏数据（用于快速训练Zero模型），每条数据字符最大长度为512（推荐设置`max_seq_len≈340`）


训练参数`max_seq_len`目前指的是tokens长度，而非绝对字符数。
本项目tokenizer在中文文本上大约`1.5~1.7 字符/token`，纯英文的压缩比在`4~5 字符/token`，不同数据分布会有波动。
数据集命名标注的“最大长度”均为字符数，100长度的字符串可粗略换算成`100/1.5≈67`的tokens长度。

例如：

* 中文：`白日依山尽`5个字符可能被拆分为[`白日`,`依`,`山`,`尽`] 4个tokens；
* 英文：`The sun sets in the west`24个字符可能被拆分为[`The `,`sun `,`sets `,`in `,`the`,`west`] 6个tokens

“推荐设置”给出了各个数据集上最大tokens长度的粗略估计。
须知max_seq_len可以激进/保守/均衡地调整，因为更大或更小均无法避免副作用：一些样本短于max_seq_len后被padding浪费算力，一些样本长于max_seq_len后被截断语意。

在 `算力效率` &lt;---&gt; `语义完整性` 之间找到一个平衡点即可

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details style=&quot;color:rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;说明 &amp; 推荐训练方案&lt;/summary&gt;

* MiniMind2 Series均经过共约20GB语料训练，大约4B tokens，即对应上面的数据组合训练结果（开销：💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰，效果：😊😊😊😊😊😊）

* 想要最快速度从0实现Zero模型，推荐使用`pretrain_hq.jsonl` + `sft_mini_512.jsonl` 的数据组合，具体花销和效果可查看下文表格（开销：💰，效果：😊😊）

* 推荐具备一定算力资源或更在意效果的朋友可以考虑前者完整复现MiniMind2；仅有单卡GPU或在乎短时间快速复现的朋友强烈推荐后者；

* 【折中方案】亦可选择例如`sft_mini_512.jsonl`、`sft_1024.jsonl`中等规模数据进行自由组合训练（开销：💰💰💰，效果：😊😊😊😊）。

&lt;/details&gt;

# 📌 Model

## Structure

MiniMind-Dense（和[Llama3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)一样）使用了Transformer的Decoder-Only结构，跟GPT-3的区别在于：

* 采用了GPT-3的预标准化方法，也就是在每个Transformer子层的输入上进行归一化，而不是在输出上。具体来说，使用的是RMSNorm归一化函数。
* 用SwiGLU激活函数替代了ReLU，这样做是为了提高性能。
* 像GPT-Neo一样，去掉了绝对位置嵌入，改用了旋转位置嵌入（RoPE），这样在处理超出训练长度的推理时效果更好。

---

MiniMind-MoE模型，它的结构基于Llama3和[Deepseek-V2/3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434)中的MixFFN混合专家模块。

* DeepSeek-V2在前馈网络（FFN）方面，采用了更细粒度的专家分割和共享的专家隔离技术，以提高Experts的效果。

---

MiniMind的整体结构一致，只是在RoPE计算、推理函数和FFN层的代码上做了一些小调整。
其结构如下图（重绘版）：

📋关于LLM的参数配置，有一篇很有意思的论文[MobileLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14905)做了详细的研究和实验。
Scaling Law在小模型中有自己独特的规律。
引起Transformer参数成规模变化的参数几乎只取决于`d_model`和`n_layers`。

* `d_model`↑ + `n_layers`↓ -&gt; 矮胖子
* `d_model`↓ + `n_layers`↑ -&gt; 瘦高个

2020年提出Scaling Law的论文认为，训练数据量、参数量以及训练迭代次数才是决定性能的关键因素，而模型架构的影响几乎可以忽视。
然而似乎这个定律对小模型并不完全适用。
MobileLLM提出架构的深度比宽度更重要，「深而窄」的「瘦长」模型可以学习到比「宽而浅」模型更多的抽象概念。
例如当模型参数固定在125M或者350M时，30～42层的「狭长」模型明显比12层左右的「矮胖」模型有更优越的性能，
在常识推理、问答、阅读理解等8个基准测试上都有类似的趋势。
这其实是非常有趣的发现，因为以往为100M左右量级的小模型设计架构时，几乎没人尝试过叠加超过12层。
这与MiniMind在训练过程中，模型参数量在`d_model`和`n_layers`之间进行调整实验观察到的效果是一致的。
然而「深而窄」的「窄」也是有维度极限的，当d_model&lt;512时，词嵌入维度坍塌的劣势非常明显，
增加的layers并不能弥补词嵌入在固定q_head带来d_head不足的

## 🤔 What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the &quot;real work&quot; of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install Specify CLI

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
# Create new project
specify init &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;

# Or initialize in existing project
specify init . --ai claude
# or
specify init --here --ai claude

# Check installed tools
specify check
```

To upgrade Specify, see the [Upgrade Guide](./docs/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. Quick upgrade:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

#### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;
```

**Benefits of persistent installation:**

- Tool stays installed and available in PATH
- No need to create shell aliases
- Better tool management with `uv tool list`, `uv tool upgrade`, `uv tool uninstall`
- Cleaner shell configuration

### 2. Establish project principles

Launch your AI assistant in the project directory. The `/speckit.*` commands are available in the assistant.

Use the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project&#039;s governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.

```bash
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

### 3. Create the spec

Use the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

```bash
/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

### 4. Create a technical implementation plan

Use the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

### 5. Break down into tasks

Use **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

### 6. Execute implementation

Use **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).

## 🔧 Specify CLI Reference

The `specify` command supports the following options:

### Commands

| Command | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`  | Initialize a new Specify project from the latest template                                                                                               |

## 📚 Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the &quot;*what*&quot; before the &quot;*how*&quot;
- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/schema.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles. This ensures the system achieves a robust, scalable approach to market analysis and decision-making.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Analyzes social media and public sentiment using sentiment scoring algorithms to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.

&lt;/p&gt;

### Researcher Team
- Comprises both bullish and bearish researchers who critically assess the insights provided by the Analyst Team. Through structured debates, they balance potential gains against inherent risks.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/researcher.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

### Trader Agent
- Composes reports from the analysts and researchers to make informed trading decisions. It determines the timing and magnitude of trades based on comprehensive market insights.

  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/trader.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.
- The Portfolio Manager approves/rejects the transaction proposal. If approved, the order will be sent to the simulated exchange and executed.

  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/risk.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## Installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone TradingAgents:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

Create a virtual environment in any of your favorite environment managers:
```bash
conda create -n tradingagents python=3.13
conda activate tradingagents
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required APIs

You will need the OpenAI API for all the agents, and [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) for fundamental and news data (default configuration).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=$YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys (see `.env.example` for reference):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

**Note:** We are happy to partner with Alpha Vantage to provide robust API support for TradingAgents. You can get a free AlphaVantage API [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key), TradingAgents-sourced requests also have increased rate limits to 60 requests per minute with no daily limits. Typically the quota is sufficient for performing complex tasks with TradingAgents thanks to Alpha Vantage’s open-source support program. If you prefer to use OpenAI for these data sources instead, you can modify the data vendor settings in `tradingagents/default_config.py`.

### CLI Usage

You can also try out the CLI directly by running:
```bash
python -m cli.main
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, date, LLMs, research depth, etc.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/cli/cli_init.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

An interface will appear showing results as they load, letting you track the agent&#039;s progress as it runs.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/cli/cli_news.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/cli/cli_transaction.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

We built TradingAgents with LangGraph to ensure flexibility and modularity. We utilize `o1-preview` and `gpt-4o` as our deep thinking and fast thinking LLMs for our experiments. However, for testing purposes, we recommend you use `o4-mini` and `gpt-4.1-mini` to save on costs as our framework makes **lots of** API calls.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here&#039;s also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate(&quot;NVDA&quot;, &quot;2024-05-10&quot;)
print(decision)
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create a custom config
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config[&quot;deep_think_llm&quot;] = &quot;gpt-4.1-nano&quot;  # Use a different model
config[&quot;quick_think_llm&quot;] = &quot;gpt-4.1-nano&quot;  # Use a different model
config[&quot;max_debate_rounds&quot;] = 1  # Increase debate rounds

# Configure data vendors (default uses yfinance and Alpha Vantage)
config[&quot;data_vendors&quot;] = {
    &quot;core_stock_apis&quot;: &quot;yfinance&quot;,           # Options: yfinance, alpha_vantage, local
    &quot;technical_indicators&quot;: &quot;yfinance&quot;,      # Options: yfinance, alpha_vantage, local
    &quot;fundamental_data&quot;: &quot;alpha_vantage&quot;,     # Options: openai, alpha_vantage, local
    &quot;news_data&quot;: &quot;alpha_vantage&quot;,            # Options: openai, alpha_vantage, google, local
}

# Initialize with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate(&quot;NVDA&quot;, &quot;2024-05-10&quot;)
print(decision)
```

&gt; The default configuration uses yfinance for stock price and technical data, and Alpha Vantage for fundamental and news data. For production use or if you encounter rate limits, consider upgrading to [Alpha Vantage Premium](https://www.alphavantage.co/premium/) for more stable and reliable data access. For offline experimentation, there&#039;s a local data vendor option that uses our **Tauric TradingDB**, a curated dataset for backtesting, though this is still in development. We&#039;re currently refining this dataset and plan to release it soon alongside our upcoming projects. Stay tuned!

You can view the full list of configurations in `tradingagents/default_config.py`.

# AutoGen

**AutoGen** is a framework for creating multi-agent AI applications that can act autonomously or work alongside humans.

&gt; **Important:** if you are new to AutoGen, please checkout [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework).
&gt; AutoGen will still be maintained and continue to receive bug fixes and critical security patches.
&gt; Read our [announcement](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/7066).

## Installation

AutoGen requires **Python 3.10 or later**.

```bash
# Install AgentChat and OpenAI client from Extensions
pip install -U &quot;autogen-agentchat&quot; &quot;autogen-ext[openai]&quot;
```

The current stable version can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/releases). If you are upgrading from AutoGen v0.2, please refer to the [Migration Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/migration-guide.html) for detailed instructions on how to update your code and configurations.

```bash
# Install AutoGen Studio for no-code GUI
pip install -U &quot;autogenstudio&quot;
```

## Quickstart

The following samples call OpenAI API, so you first need to create an account and export your key as `export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;sk-...&quot;`.

### Hello World

Create an assistant agent using OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4o model. See [other supported models](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/tutorial/models.html).

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

async def main() -&gt; None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;)
    agent = AssistantAgent(&quot;assistant&quot;, model_client=model_client)
    print(await agent.run(task=&quot;Say &#039;Hello World!&#039;&quot;))
    await model_client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### MCP Server

Create a web browsing assistant agent that uses the Playwright MCP server.

```python
# First run `npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest` to install the MCP server.
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient
from autogen_ext.tools.mcp import McpWorkbench, StdioServerParams


async def main() -&gt; None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;)
    server_params = StdioServerParams(
        command=&quot;npx&quot;,
        args=[
            &quot;@playwright/mcp@latest&quot;,
            &quot;--headless&quot;,
        ],
    )
    async with McpWorkbench(server_params) as mcp:
        agent = AssistantAgent(
            &quot;web_browsing_assistant&quot;,
            model_client=model_client,
            workbench=mcp, # For multiple MCP servers, put them in a list.
            model_client_stream=True,
            max_tool_iterations=10,
        )
        await Console(agent.run_stream(task=&quot;Find out how many contributors for the microsoft/autogen repository&quot;))


asyncio.run(main())
```

&gt; **Warning**: Only connect to trusted MCP servers as they may execute commands
&gt; in your local environment or expose sensitive information.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

You can use `AgentTool` to create a basic multi-agent orchestration setup.

```python
import asyncio

from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.tools import AgentTool
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient


async def main() -&gt; None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=&quot;gpt-4.1&quot;)

    math_agent = AssistantAgent(
        &quot;math_expert&quot;,
        model_client=model_client,
        system_message=&quot;You are a math expert.&quot;,
        description=&quot;A math expert assistant.&quot;,
        model_client_stream=True,
    )
    math_agent_tool = AgentTool(math_agent, return_value_as_last_message=True)

    chemistry_agent = AssistantAgent(
        &quot;chemistry_expert&quot;,
        model_client=model_client,
        system_message=&quot;You are a chemistry expert.&quot;,
        description=&quot;A chemistry expert assistant.&quot;,
        model_client_stream=True,
    )
    chemistry_agent_tool = AgentTool(chemistry_agent, return_value_as_last_message=True)

    agent = AssistantAgent(
        &quot;assistant&quot;,
        system_message=&quot;You are a general assistant. Use expert tools when needed.&quot;,
        model_client=model_client,
        model_client_stream=True,
        tools=[math_agent_tool, chemistry_agent_tool],
        max_tool_iterations=10,
    )
    await Console(agent.run_stream(task=&quot;What is the integral of x^2?&quot;))
    await Console(agent.run_stream(task=&quot;What is the molecular weight of water?&quot;))


asyncio.run(main())
```

For more advanced multi-agent orchestrations and workflows, read
[AgentChat documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/index.html).

### AutoGen Studio

Use AutoGen Studio to prototype and run multi-agent workflows without writing code.

```bash
# Run AutoGen Studio on http://localhost:8080
autogenstudio ui --port 8080 --appdir ./my-app
```

## Why Use AutoGen?

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;autogen-landing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AutoGen Landing&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The AutoGen ecosystem provides everything you need to create AI agents, especially multi-agent workflows -- framework, developer tools, and applications.

The _framework_ uses a layered and extensible design. Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.

- [Core API](./python/packages/autogen-core/) implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.
- [AgentChat API](./python/packages/autogen-agentchat/) implements a simpler but opinionated API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.
- [Extensions API](./python/packages/autogen-ext/) enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.

The ecosystem also supports two essential _developer tools_:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/microsoft/autogen/refs/heads/main/python/packages/autogen-studio/docs/ags_screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;AutoGen Studio Screenshot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- [AutoGen Studio](./python/packages/autogen-studio/) provides a no-code GUI for building multi-agent applications.
- [AutoGen Bench](./python/packages/agbench/) provides a benchmarking suite for evaluating agent performance.

You can use the AutoGen framework and developer tools to create applications for your domain. For example, [Magentic-One](./python/packages/magentic-one-cli/) is a state-of-the-art multi-agent team built using AgentChat API and Extensions API that can handle a variety of tasks that require web browsing, code execution, and file handling.

With AutoGen you get to join and contribute to a thriving ecosystem. We host weekly office hours and talks with maintainers and community. We also have a [Discord server](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord) for real-time chat, GitHub Discussions for Q&amp;A, and a blog for tutorials and updates.

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as 👤 User
    participant W as 🌐 &lt;vanna-chat&gt;
    participant S as 🐍 Your Server
    participant A as 🤖 Agent
    participant T as 🧰 Tools

    U-&gt;&gt;W: &quot;Show Q4 sales&quot;
    W-&gt;&gt;S: POST /api/vanna/v2/chat_sse (with auth)
    S-&gt;&gt;A: User(id=alice, groups=[read_sales])
    A-&gt;&gt;T: Execute SQL tool (user-aware)
    T-&gt;&gt;T: Apply row-level security
    T-&gt;&gt;A: Filtered results
    A-&gt;&gt;W: Stream: Table → Chart → Summary
    W-&gt;&gt;U: Display beautiful UI
```

**Key Concepts:**

1. **User Resolver** — You define how to extract user identity from requests (cookies, JWTs, etc.)
2. **User-Aware Tools** — Tools automatically check permissions based on user&#039;s group memberships
3. **Streaming Components** — Backend streams structured UI components (tables, charts) to frontend
4. **Built-in Web UI** — Pre-built `&lt;vanna-chat&gt;` component renders everything beautifully

## Production Setup with Your Auth

Here&#039;s a complete example integrating Vanna with your existing FastAPI app and authentication:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from vanna import Agent
from vanna.servers.fastapi.routes import register_chat_routes
from vanna.servers.base import ChatHandler
from vanna.core.user import UserResolver, User, RequestContext
from vanna.integrations.anthropic import AnthropicLlmService
from vanna.tools import RunSqlTool
from vanna.integrations.sqlite import SqliteRunner
from vanna.core.registry import ToolRegistry

# Your existing FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# 1. Define your user resolver (using YOUR auth system)
class MyUserResolver(UserResolver):
    async def resolve_user(self, request_context: RequestContext) -&gt; User:
        # Extract from cookies, JWTs, or session
        token = request_context.get_header(&#039;Authorization&#039;)
        user_data = self.decode_jwt(token)  # Your existing logic

        return User(
            id=user_data[&#039;id&#039;],
            email=user_data[&#039;email&#039;],
            group_memberships=user_data[&#039;groups&#039;]  # Used for permissions
        )

# 2. Set up agent with tools
llm = AnthropicLlmService(model=&quot;claude-sonnet-4-5&quot;)
tools = ToolRegistry()
tools.register(RunSqlTool(sql_runner=SqliteRunner(&quot;./data.db&quot;)))

agent = Agent(
    llm_service=llm,
    tool_registry=tools,
    user_resolver=MyUserResolver()
)

# 3. Add Vanna routes to your app
chat_handler = ChatHandler(agent)
register_chat_routes(app, chat_handler)

# Now you have:
# - POST /api/vanna/v2/chat_sse (streaming endpoint)
# - GET / (optional web UI)
```

**Then in your frontend:**
```html
&lt;vanna-chat sse-endpoint=&quot;/api/vanna/v2/chat_sse&quot;&gt;&lt;/vanna-chat&gt;
```

See [Full Documentation](https://vanna.ai/docs) for custom tools, lifecycle hooks, and advanced configuration

## Custom Tools

Extend Vanna with custom tools for your specific use case:

```python
from vanna.core.tool import Tool, ToolContext, ToolResult
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Type

class EmailArgs(BaseModel):
    recipient: str = Field(description=&quot;Email recipient&quot;)
    subject: str = Field(description=&quot;Email subject&quot;)

class EmailTool(Tool[EmailArgs]):
    @property
    def name(self) -&gt; str:
        return &quot;send_email&quot;

    @property
    def access_groups(self) -&gt; list[str]:
        return [&quot;send_email&quot;]  # Permission check

    def get_args_schema(self) -&gt; Type[EmailArgs]:
        return EmailArgs

    async def execute(self, context: ToolContext, args: EmailArgs) -&gt; ToolResult:
        user = context.user  # Automatically injected

        # Your business logic
        await self.email_service.send(
            from_email=user.email,
            to=args.recipient,
            subject=args.subject
        )

        return ToolResult(success=True, result_for_llm=f&quot;Email sent to {args.recipient}&quot;)

# Register your tool
tools.register(EmailTool())
```

**Upgrading from Vanna 0.x?**

Vanna 2.0 is a complete rewrite focused on user-aware agents and production deployments. Key changes:

- **New API**: Agent-based instead of `VannaBase` class methods
- **User-aware**: Every component now knows the user identity
- **Streaming**: Rich UI components instead of text/dataframes
- **Web-first**: Built-in `&lt;vanna-chat&gt;` component and server

**Migration path:**

1. **Quick wrap** — Use `LegacyVannaAdapter` to wrap your existing Vanna 0.x instance and get the new web UI immediately
2. **Gradual migration** — Incrementally move to the new Agent API and tools

See the complete [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.
