2025-09-05: VibeVoice is an open-source research framework intended to advance collaboration in the speech synthesis community. After release, we discovered instances where the tool was used in ways inconsistent with the stated intent. Since responsible use of AI is one of Microsoft’s guiding principles, we have disabled this repo until we are confident that out-of-scope use is no longer possible.


### Overview

VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating **expressive**, **long-form**, **multi-speaker** conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.

VibeVoice currently includes two model variants:

- **Long-form multi-speaker model**: Synthesizes conversational/single-speaker speech up to **90 minutes** with up to **4 distinct speakers**, surpassing the typical 1–2 speaker limits of many prior models.
- **[Realtime streaming TTS model](docs/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b.md)**: Produces initial audible speech in ~**300 ms** and supports **streaming text input** for single-speaker **real-time** speech generation; designed for low-latency generation.

A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a [next-token diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635) framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.

## Risks and limitations

While efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release).
Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.

English and Chinese only: Transcripts in languages other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs.

Non-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects.

Overlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.

We do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.

cuTile Python
=============

cuTile Python is a programming language for NVIDIA GPUs. The official documentation can be found
on [docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cutile-python),
or built from source located in the [docs](docs/) folder.

Installing from PyPI
--------------------
cuTile Python is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) under the
[cuda-tile](https://pypi.org/project/cuda-tile/) package name and can be installed with `pip`:
```
pip install cuda-tile
```
Currently, the [CUDA Toolkit 13.1+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) is required
and needs to be installed separately.

Building from Source
--------------------
cuTile is written mostly in Python, but includes a C++ extension which needs to be built.
You will need:
- A C++17-capable compiler, such as GNU C++ or MSVC;
- CMake 3.18+;
- GNU Make on Linux or msbuild on Windows;
- Python 3.10+ with development headers (`venv` module is recommended but optional);
- [CUDA Toolkit 13.1+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

On an Ubuntu system, the first four dependencies can be installed with APT:
```
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake python3-dev python3-venv
```

The CMakeLists.txt script will also automatically download
the [DLPack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack) dependency from GitHub.
If you wish to disable this behavior and provide your own copy of DLPack,
set the `CUDA_TILE_CMAKE_DLPACK_PATH` environment variable to a local path
to the DLPack source tree.

Unless you are already using a Python virtual environment, it is recommended to create one
in order to avoid installing cuTile globally:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Once the build dependencies are in place, the simplest way to build cuTile is to install it
in editable mode by running the following command in the source root directory:

```
pip install -e .
```

This will create the `build` directory and invoke the CMake-based build process.
In editable mode, the compiled extension module will be placed in the build directory,
and then a symbolic link to it will be created in the source directory.
This makes sure that the `pip install -e .` command above is needed only once, and recompiling
the extension after making changes to the C++ code can be done with `make -C build`
which is much faster. This logic is defined in [setup.py](./setup.py).

Running Tests
-------------
cuTile uses the [pytest](https://pytest.org) framework for testing.
Tests have extra dependencies, such as PyTorch, which can be installed with
```
pip install -r test/requirements.txt
```

The tests are located in the [test/](test/) directory. To run a specific test file,
for example `test_copy.py`, use the following command:
```
pytest test/test_copy.py
```

## Why PAL MCP?

**Why rely on one AI model when you can orchestrate them all?**

A Model Context Protocol server that supercharges tools like [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), and IDE clients such
as [Cursor](https://cursor.com) or the [Claude Dev VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Anthropic.claude-vscode). **PAL MCP connects your favorite AI tool
to multiple AI models** for enhanced code analysis, problem-solving, and collaborative development.

### True AI Collaboration with Conversation Continuity

PAL supports **conversation threading** so your CLI can **discuss ideas with multiple AI models, exchange reasoning, get second opinions, and even run collaborative debates between models** to help you reach deeper insights and better solutions.

Your CLI always stays in control but gets perspectives from the best AI for each subtask. Context carries forward seamlessly across tools and models, enabling complex workflows like: code reviews with multiple models → automated planning → implementation → pre-commit validation.

&gt; **You&#039;re in control.** Your CLI of choice orchestrates the AI team, but you decide the workflow. Craft powerful prompts that bring in Gemini Pro, GPT 5, Flash, or local offline models exactly when needed.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reasons to Use PAL MCP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

A typical workflow with Claude Code as an example:

1. **Multi-Model Orchestration** - Claude coordinates with Gemini Pro, O3, GPT-5, and 50+ other models to get the best analysis for each task

2. **Context Revival Magic** - Even after Claude&#039;s context resets, continue conversations seamlessly by having other models &quot;remind&quot; Claude of the discussion

3. **Guided Workflows** - Enforces systematic investigation phases that prevent rushed analysis and ensure thorough code examination

4. **Extended Context Windows** - Break Claude&#039;s limits by delegating to Gemini (1M tokens) or O3 (200K tokens) for massive codebases

5. **True Conversation Continuity** - Full context flows across tools and models - Gemini remembers what O3 said 10 steps ago

6. **Model-Specific Strengths** - Extended thinking with Gemini Pro, blazing speed with Flash, strong reasoning with O3, privacy with local Ollama

7. **Professional Code Reviews** - Multi-pass analysis with severity levels, actionable feedback, and consensus from multiple AI experts

8. **Smart Debugging Assistant** - Systematic root cause analysis with hypothesis tracking and confidence levels

9. **Automatic Model Selection** - Claude intelligently picks the right model for each subtask (or you can specify)

10. **Vision Capabilities** - Analyze screenshots, diagrams, and visual content with vision-enabled models

11. **Local Model Support** - Run Llama, Mistral, or other models locally for complete privacy and zero API costs

12. **Bypass MCP Token Limits** - Automatically works around MCP&#039;s 25K limit for large prompts and responses

**The Killer Feature:** When Claude&#039;s context resets, just ask to &quot;continue with O3&quot; - the other model&#039;s response magically revives Claude&#039;s understanding without re-ingesting documents!

#### Example: Multi-Model Code Review Workflow

1. `Perform a codereview using gemini pro and o3 and use planner to generate a detailed plan, implement the fixes and do a final precommit check by continuing from the previous codereview`
2. This triggers a [`codereview`](docs/tools/codereview.md) workflow where Claude walks the code, looking for all kinds of issues
3. After multiple passes, collects relevant code and makes note of issues along the way
4. Maintains a `confidence` level between `exploring`, `low`, `medium`, `high` and `certain` to track how confidently it&#039;s been able to find and identify issues
5. Generates a detailed list of critical -&gt; low issues
6. Shares the relevant files, findings, etc with **Gemini Pro** to perform a deep dive for a second [`codereview`](docs/tools/codereview.md)
7. Comes back with a response and next does the same with o3, adding to the prompt if a new discovery comes to light
8. When done, Claude takes in all the feedback and combines a single list of all critical -&gt; low issues, including good patterns in your code. The final list includes new findings or revisions in case Claude misunderstood or missed something crucial and one of the other models pointed this out
9. It then uses the [`planner`](docs/tools/planner.md) workflow to break the work down into simpler steps if a major refactor is required
10. Claude then performs the actual work of fixing highlighted issues
11. When done, Claude returns to Gemini Pro for a [`precommit`](docs/tools/precommit.md) review

All within a single conversation thread! Gemini Pro in step 11 _knows_ what was recommended by O3 in step 7! Taking that context
and review into consideration to aid with its final pre-commit review.

**Think of it as Claude Code _for_ Claude Code.** This MCP isn&#039;t magic. It&#039;s just **super-glue**.

&gt; **Remember:** Claude stays in full control — but **YOU** call the shots.
&gt; PAL is designed to have Claude engage other models only when needed — and to follow through with meaningful back-and-forth.
&gt; **You&#039;re** the one who crafts the powerful prompt that makes Claude bring in Gemini, Flash, O3 — or fly solo.
&gt; You&#039;re the guide. The prompter. The puppeteer.
&gt; #### You are the AI - **Actually Intelligent**.
&lt;/details&gt;

#### Recommended AI Stack

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;For Claude Code Users&lt;/summary&gt;

For best results when using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code):  

- **Sonnet 4.5** - All agentic work and orchestration
- **Gemini 3.0 Pro** OR **GPT-5-Pro** - Deep thinking, additional code reviews, debugging and validations, pre-commit analysis

./run-server.sh  
```

**Option B: Instant Setup with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**
```json
// Add to ~/.claude/settings.json or .mcp.json
// Don&#039;t forget to add your API keys under env
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;pal&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;bash&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-c&quot;, &quot;for p in $(which uvx 2&gt;/dev/null) $HOME/.local/bin/uvx /opt/homebrew/bin/uvx /usr/local/bin/uvx uvx; do [ -x \&quot;$p\&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec \&quot;$p\&quot; --from git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server.git pal-mcp-server; done; echo &#039;uvx not found&#039; &gt;&amp;2; exit 1&quot;],
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;PATH&quot;: &quot;/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:~/.local/bin&quot;,
        &quot;GEMINI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-key-here&quot;,

## Provider Configuration

PAL activates any provider that has credentials in your `.env`. See `.env.example` for deeper customization.

## Core Tools

&gt; **Note:** Each tool comes with its own multi-step workflow, parameters, and descriptions that consume valuable context window space even when not in use. To optimize performance, some tools are disabled by default. See [Tool Configuration](#tool-configuration) below to enable them.

**Collaboration &amp; Planning** *(Enabled by default)*
- **[`clink`](docs/tools/clink.md)** - Bridge requests to external AI CLIs (Gemini planner, codereviewer, etc.)
- **[`chat`](docs/tools/chat.md)** - Brainstorm ideas, get second opinions, validate approaches. With capable models (GPT-5 Pro, Gemini 3.0 Pro), generates complete code / implementation
- **[`thinkdeep`](docs/tools/thinkdeep.md)** - Extended reasoning, edge case analysis, alternative perspectives
- **[`planner`](docs/tools/planner.md)** - Break down complex projects into structured, actionable plans
- **[`consensus`](docs/tools/consensus.md)** - Get expert opinions from multiple AI models with stance steering

**Code Analysis &amp; Quality**
- **[`debug`](docs/tools/debug.md)** - Systematic investigation and root cause analysis
- **[`precommit`](docs/tools/precommit.md)** - Validate changes before committing, prevent regressions
- **[`codereview`](docs/tools/codereview.md)** - Professional reviews with severity levels and actionable feedback
- **[`analyze`](docs/tools/analyze.md)** *(disabled by default - [enable](#tool-configuration))* - Understand architecture, patterns, dependencies across entire codebases

**Development Tools** *(Disabled by default - [enable](#tool-configuration))*
- **[`refactor`](docs/tools/refactor.md)** - Intelligent code refactoring with decomposition focus
- **[`testgen`](docs/tools/testgen.md)** - Comprehensive test generation with edge cases
- **[`secaudit`](docs/tools/secaudit.md)** - Security audits with OWASP Top 10 analysis
- **[`docgen`](docs/tools/docgen.md)** - Generate documentation with complexity analysis

**Utilities**
- **[`apilookup`](docs/tools/apilookup.md)** - Forces current-year API/SDK documentation lookups in a sub-process (saves tokens within the current context window), prevents outdated training data responses
- **[`challenge`](docs/tools/challenge.md)** - Prevent &quot;You&#039;re absolutely right!&quot; responses with critical analysis
- **[`tracer`](docs/tools/tracer.md)** *(disabled by default - [enable](#tool-configuration))* - Static analysis prompts for call-flow mapping

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b id=&quot;tool-configuration&quot;&gt;👉 Tool Configuration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

### Default Configuration

To optimize context window usage, only essential tools are enabled by default:

**Enabled by default:**
- `chat`, `thinkdeep`, `planner`, `consensus` - Core collaboration tools
- `codereview`, `precommit`, `debug` - Essential code quality tools
- `apilookup` - Rapid API/SDK information lookup
- `challenge` - Critical thinking utility

**Disabled by default:**
- `analyze`, `refactor`, `testgen`, `secaudit`, `docgen`, `tracer`

### Enabling Additional Tools

To enable additional tools, remove them from the `DISABLED_TOOLS` list:

**Option 1: Edit your .env file**
```bash
# Default configuration (from .env.example)
DISABLED_TOOLS=analyze,refactor,testgen,secaudit,docgen,tracer

# To enable specific tools, remove them from the list
# Example: Enable analyze tool
DISABLED_TOOLS=refactor,testgen,secaudit,docgen,tracer

# To enable ALL tools
DISABLED_TOOLS=
```

**Option 2: Configure in MCP settings**
```json
// In ~/.claude/settings.json or .mcp.json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;pal&quot;: {
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        // Tool configuration
        &quot;DISABLED_TOOLS&quot;: &quot;refactor,testgen,secaudit,docgen,tracer&quot;,
        &quot;DEFAULT_MODEL&quot;: &quot;pro&quot;,
        &quot;DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP&quot;: &quot;high&quot;,
        
        // API configuration
        &quot;GEMINI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-gemini-key&quot;,
        &quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-openai-key&quot;,
        &quot;OPENROUTER_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-openrouter-key&quot;,
        
        // Logging and performance
        &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot;: &quot;INFO&quot;,
        &quot;CONVERSATION_TIMEOUT_HOURS&quot;: &quot;6&quot;,
        &quot;MAX_CONVERSATION_TURNS&quot;: &quot;50&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 3: Enable all tools**
```json
// Remove or empty the DISABLED_TOOLS to enable everything
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;pal&quot;: {
      &quot;env&quot;: {
        &quot;DISABLED_TOOLS&quot;: &quot;&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:**
- Essential tools (`version`, `listmodels`) cannot be disabled
- After changing tool configuration, restart your Claude session for changes to take effect
- Each tool adds to context window usage, so only enable what you need

&lt;/details&gt;

## 📺 Watch Tools In Action

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chat Tool&lt;/b&gt; - Collaborative decision making and multi-turn conversations&lt;/summary&gt;

**Picking Redis vs Memcached:**

[Chat Redis or Memcached_web.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41076cfe-dd49-4dfc-82f5-d7461b34705d)

#### Licensing

While yt-dlp is licensed under the [Unlicense](LICENSE), many of the release files contain code from other projects with different licenses.

Most notably, the PyInstaller-bundled executables include GPLv3+ licensed code, and as such the combined work is licensed under [GPLv3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

The zipimport Unix executable (`yt-dlp`) contains [ISC](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah/blob/main/LICENSE.md) licensed code from [`meriyah`](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah) and [MIT](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed code from [`astring`](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring).

See [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt) for more details.

The git repository, the source tarball (`yt-dlp.tar.gz`), the PyPI source distribution and the PyPI built distribution (wheel) only contain code licensed under the [Unlicense](LICENSE).

**Note**: The manpages, shell completion (autocomplete) files etc. are available inside the [source tarball](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.tar.gz)


## UPDATE
You can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)

If you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program

For other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer to their documentation

&lt;a id=&quot;update-channels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.

* `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.
* The `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project&#039;s new patches and changes. This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip&#039;s `--pre` flag).
* The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).

When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.

You may also use `--update-to &lt;repository&gt;` (`&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.

Example usage:

* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release
* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`
* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel
* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`

**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:
```
# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly

# To install nightly with pip:
python -m pip install -U --pre &quot;yt-dlp[default]&quot;
```

When running a yt-dlp version that is older than 90 days, you will see a warning message suggesting to update to the latest version.
You can suppress this warning by adding `--no-update` to your command or configuration file.

## DEPENDENCIES
Python versions 3.10+ (CPython) and 3.11+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.

&lt;!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created
&lt;!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x&gt;
On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt;

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `yt-dlp-ejs` and a supported JavaScript runtime/engine are highly recommended

### Strongly recommended

* [**ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**](https://www.ffmpeg.org) - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds

    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)

* [**yt-dlp-ejs**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs) - Required for deciphering YouTube n/sig values. Licensed under [Unlicense](https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs/blob/main/LICENSE), bundles [MIT](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring/blob/main/LICENSE) and [ISC](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah/blob/main/LICENSE.md) components.

    A JavaScript runtime/engine like [**deno**](https://deno.land) (recommended), [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org), [**bun**](https://bun.sh), or [**QuickJS**](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) is also required to run yt-dlp-ejs. See [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS).

## About Cognee

Cognee is an open-source tool and platform that transforms your raw data into persistent and dynamic AI memory for Agents. It combines vector search with graph databases to make your documents both searchable by meaning and connected by relationships. 

You can use Cognee in two ways:

1. [Self-host Cognee Open Source](https://docs.cognee.ai/getting-started/installation), which stores all data locally by default.
2. [Connect to Cognee Cloud](https://platform.cognee.ai/), and get the same OSS stack on managed infrastructure for easier development and productionization. 

### Cognee Open Source (self-hosted):

- Interconnects any type of data — including past conversations, files, images, and audio transcriptions
- Replaces traditional RAG systems with a unified memory layer built on graphs and vectors
- Reduces developer effort and infrastructure cost while improving quality and precision
- Provides Pythonic data pipelines for ingestion from 30+ data sources
- Offers high customizability through user-defined tasks, modular pipelines, and built-in search endpoints

### Cognee Cloud (managed):
- Hosted web UI dashboard 
- Automatic version updates 
- Resource usage analytics
- GDPR compliant, enterprise-grade security

## Basic Usage &amp; Feature Guide

To learn more, [check out this short, end-to-end Colab walkthrough](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Vi9zID-M3fpKpKiaqDBvkk98ElkRPWy?usp=sharing) of Cognee&#039;s core features.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Vi9zID-M3fpKpKiaqDBvkk98ElkRPWy?usp=sharing)

## Quickstart

Let’s try Cognee in just a few lines of code. For detailed setup and configuration, see the [Cognee Docs](https://docs.cognee.ai/getting-started/installation#environment-configuration).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 to 3.13

### Step 1: Install Cognee

You can install Cognee with **pip**, **poetry**, **uv**, or your preferred Python package manager.

```bash
uv pip install cognee
```

### Step 2: Configure the LLM
```python
import os
os.environ[&quot;LLM_API_KEY&quot;] = &quot;YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;
```
Alternatively, create a `.env` file using our [template](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee/blob/main/.env.template).

To integrate other LLM providers, see our [LLM Provider Documentation](https://docs.cognee.ai/setup-configuration/llm-providers).

### Step 3: Run the Pipeline

Cognee will take your documents, generate a knowledge graph from them and then query the graph based on combined relationships. 

Now, run a minimal pipeline:

```python
import cognee
import asyncio


async def main():
    # Add text to cognee
    await cognee.add(&quot;Cognee turns documents into AI memory.&quot;)

    # Generate the knowledge graph
    await cognee.cognify()

    # Add memory algorithms to the graph
    await cognee.memify()

    # Query the knowledge graph
    results = await cognee.search(&quot;What does Cognee do?&quot;)

    # Display the results
    for result in results:
        print(result)


if __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:
    asyncio.run(main())

```

As you can see, the output is generated from the document we previously stored in Cognee:

```bash
  Cognee turns documents into AI memory.
```

### Use the Cognee CLI 

As an alternative, you can get started with these essential commands:

```bash
cognee-cli add &quot;Cognee turns documents into AI memory.&quot;

cognee-cli cognify

cognee-cli search &quot;What does Cognee do?&quot;
cognee-cli delete --all

```

To open the local UI, run:
```bash
cognee-cli -ui
```

Or free on the Internet:

- Plex TV
- Pluto TV (English, Spanish, French, Italian)
- Redbox Live TV
- Roku TV
- Samsung TV Plus
- Youtube live channels

To use it point your IPTV player to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Free-TV/IPTV/master/playlist.m3u8.

Philosophy
==========

The main goals for this playlist are listed below.

**Quality over quantity**

The less channels we support the better.

- All channels should work well.
- As much as possible channels should be in HD, not SD.
- Only one URL per channel (no +1, no alternate feeds, no regional declinations)

**Only free channels**

If a channel is normally only available via commercial subscriptions it has nothing to do in this playlist. If on the other hand it is provided for free to everybody in a particular country, then it should be in this playlist.

- No paid channels
- Only channels which are officially provided for free (via DVB-S, DVB-T, analog, etc..)

**Only mainstream channels**

This is a playlist for everybody.

- No adult channels
- No channels dedicated to any particular religion
- No channels dedicated to any particular political party
- No channels made for a country and funded by a different country

Feed sources
============

It can be quite hard to find up to date URLs, here&#039;s a list of sources:

- https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/tree/master/streams
- Youtube: As long as the channel is live and its URL doesn&#039;t change (check the age of the stream, the number of viewers..)
- Dailymotion: Same criteria as for youtube

Format
======

The m3u8 playlist is generated by `make_playlist.py`, using the `.md` files located in `lists`.

Each .md file represesnts a group. The `&lt;h1&gt;` line is used as the group title.

Only channels which URL column starts with `[&gt;]` are included in the playlist.

Channels which are not in HD are marked with an `Ⓢ`.

Channels which use GeoIP blocking are marked with a `Ⓖ`.

Channels which are live Youtube channels are marked with a `Ⓨ`.

Issues
======

Only create issues for bugs and feature requests.

Do not create issues to add/edit or to remove channels. If you want to add/edit/remove channels, create a pull request directly.

Pull Requests
=============

**Only modify .md files**

If your Pull Request modifies channels, only modify .md files. Do not modify m3u8 files in your pull request.

**Adding a new Channel**

To add a new channel, make a Pull Request.

- In your Pull Request you need to provide information to show that the channel is free.
- Use imgur.com to host the channel logo and point to it.
- If you have a valid stream, add it and put `[&gt;]` in front of it.
- If you don&#039;t have an stream for the channel, add `[x]()` in the url column and place your channel in the Invalid category.
- If you have a stream but it doesn&#039;t work well, put the channel in the Invalid category and put `[x]` in front of the url.
- If you&#039;re adding geoblocked URLs specify it in your PR and specify which country they&#039;re working in. The PR will only be merged if these URLs can be tested.

**Removing a Channel**

To remove a channel, make a Pull Request.

In your Pull Request you need to provide information to show that the channel is only available via a private paid subscription.

Note: Public taxes (whether national or regional, whether called TV License or not) do not constitute a private paid subscription.

If a stream is broken, simply move the channel to the invalid category and replace `[&gt;]` with `[x]` in the url column.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Protein design with Foundry

Foundry provides tooling and infrastructure for using and training all classes of models for protein design, including design (RFD3), inverse folding (ProteinMPNN) and protein folding (RF3).

All models within Foundry rely on [AtomWorks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks) - a unified framework for manipulating and processing biomolecular structures - for both training and inference. 

## Getting Started
### Quickstart guide
**Installation**
```bash
pip install rc-foundry[all]
```

**Downloading weights** Models can be downloaded to a target folder with:
```
foundry install base-models --checkpoint-dir &lt;path/to/ckpt/dir&gt;
```
where `checkpoint-dir` will be `~/.foundry/checkpoints` by default. Foundry always searches `~/.foundry/checkpoints` plus any colon-separated entries in `$FOUNDRY_CHECKPOINT_DIRS` during inference or subsequent commands to find checkpoints. `base-models` installs the latest RFD3, RF3 and MPNN variants - you can also download all of the models supported (including multiple checkpoints of RF3) with `all`, or by listing the models sequentially (e.g. `foundry install rfd3 rf3 ...`).
To list the registry of available checkpoints:
```
foundry list-available
```
To check what you already have downloaded (searches `~/.foundry/checkpoints` plus `$FOUNDRY_CHECKPOINT_DIRS` if set):
```
foundry list-installed
```

&gt;*See `examples/all.ipynb` for how to run each model and design proteins end-to-end in a notebook.*

### Google Colab
For an interactive Google Colab notebook walking through a basic design pipeline with RFD3, MPNN, and RF3, please see the [IPD Design Pipeline Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZwIMV3n9h0ZOnIXX0GyKUuoiahgifBxh?usp=sharing).

### RFdiffusion3 (RFD3)

[RFdiffusion3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.18.676967v2) is an all-atom generative model capable of designing protein structures under complex constraints. 

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;RFdiffusion3 generation trajectory.&quot; width=&quot;700&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; *See [models/rfd3/README.md](models/rfd3/README.md) for complete documentation.*

### RosettaFold3 (RF3)

[RF3](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.14.670328) is a structure prediction neural network that narrows the gap between closed-source AF-3 and open-source alternatives.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/prot_dna.png&quot; alt=&quot;Protein-DNA complex prediction&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; *See [models/rf3/README.md](models/rf3/README.md) for complete documentation.*

### ProteinMPNN
[ProteinMPNN](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187) and [LigandMPNN](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02626-1) are lightweight inverse-folding models which can be use to design diverse sequences for backbones under constrained conditions.

&gt; *See [models/mpnn/README.md](models/mpnn/README.md) for complete documentation.*

## Development

### Code Organization

**Strict dependency flow:** `foundry` → `atomworks`

- **atomworks**: Structure I/O, preprocessing, featurization
- **foundry**: Model architectures, training, inference endpoints
- **models/\&lt;model\&gt;:** Released models.

#### For Core Developers (Multiple Packages)

Install both `foundry` and models in editable mode for development:

```bash
uv pip install -e &#039;.[all,dev]&#039;
```

This approach allows you to:
- Modify `foundry` shared utilities and see changes immediately
- Work on specific models without installing all models
- Add new models as independent packages in `models/`

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Running tests is not currently supported, test files may be missing.

### Adding New Models

To add a new model:

1. Create `models/&lt;model_name&gt;/` directory with its own `pyproject.toml`
2. Add `foundry` as a dependency
3. Implement model-specific code in `models/&lt;model_name&gt;/src/`
4. Users can install with: `uv pip install -e ./models/&lt;model_name&gt;`

### Pre-commit Formatting

We ship a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs `make format` (via `ruff format`) before each commit. Enable it once per clone:

```bash
pip install pre-commit  # if not already installed
pre-commit install
```

After installation the hook automatically formats the repo whenever you `git commit`. Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to apply it manually.

# Installation

## Install via requirements.txt

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py 
```

## Install SET
=======
#### Mac OS X
You will need to use a virtual environment for the Python install if you are using an M2 Macbook with the following instructions in your CLI within the social-engineer-toolkit directory. 
```bash
    # to install dependencies, run the following:
    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    # to install SET
    sudo python3 setup.py 
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Installation
#### Windows 10 WSL/WSL2 Kali Linux
```bash
sudo apt install set -y
