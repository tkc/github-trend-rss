# Installing

## Windows Portable

There is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).

### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)

Simply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) and run. Make sure you put your Stable Diffusion checkpoints/models (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints

If you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -&gt; properties -&gt; unblock

#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?

See the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.

## Jupyter Notebook

To run it on services like paperspace, kaggle or colab you can use my [Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/comfyui_colab.ipynb)


## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)

You can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:
```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy install
```

## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)

python 3.13 is supported but using 3.12 is recommended because some custom nodes and their dependencies might not support it yet.

Git clone this repo.

Put your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints

Put your VAE in: models/vae


### AMD GPUs (Linux only)
AMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don&#039;t have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.3```

This is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 6.4 which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4```

### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)

(Option 1) Intel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip (currently available in PyTorch nightly builds). More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)
  
1. To install PyTorch nightly, use the following command:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```

2. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`


(Option 2) Alternatively, Intel GPUs supported by Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) can leverage IPEX for improved performance.

1. For Intel® Arc™ A-Series Graphics utilizing IPEX, create a conda environment and use the commands below:

```
conda install libuv
pip install torch==2.3.1.post0+cxx11.abi torchvision==0.18.1.post0+cxx11.abi torchaudio==2.3.1.post0+cxx11.abi intel-extension-for-pytorch==2.3.110.post0+xpu --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/ --extra-index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/cn/
```

For other supported Intel GPUs with IPEX, visit [Installation](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/index.html#installation?platform=gpu) for more information.

Additional discussion and help can be found [here](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/discussions/476).

### NVIDIA

Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128```

This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the &quot;Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled&quot; error, uninstall torch with:

```pip uninstall torch```

And install it again with the command above.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.

### Others:

#### Apple Mac silicon

You can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.

1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).
1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.
1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).
1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

&gt; **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).

#### DirectML (AMD Cards on Windows)

This is very badly supported and is not recommended. There are some unofficial builds of pytorch ROCm on windows that exist that will give you a much better experience than this. This readme will be updated once official pytorch ROCm builds for windows come out.

```pip install torch-directml``` Then you can launch ComfyUI with: ```python main.py --directml```

#### Ascend NPUs

For models compatible with Ascend Extension for PyTorch (torch_npu). To get started, ensure your environment meets the prerequisites outlined on the [installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/ascend/quick_install.html) page. Here&#039;s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:

1. Begin by installing the recommended or newer kernel version for Linux as specified in the Installation page of torch-npu, if necessary.
2. Proceed with the installation of Ascend Basekit, which includes the driver, firmware, and CANN, following the instructions provided for your specific platform.
3. Next, install the necessary packages for torch-npu by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/pytorch/install.html#pytorch) page.
4. Finally, adhere to the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) guide for Linux. Once all components are installed, you can run ComfyUI as described earlier.

#### Cambricon MLUs

For models compatible with Cambricon Extension for PyTorch (torch_mlu). Here&#039;s a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:

1. Install the Cambricon CNToolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cntoolkit_3.7.2/cntoolkit_install_3.7.2/index.html)

    &lt;i&gt;An animation engine for explanatory math videos&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It&#039;s used to create precise animations programmatically, as demonstrated in the videos of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; The community edition of Manim (ManimCE) is a version maintained and developed by the community. It was forked from 3b1b/manim, a tool originally created and open-sourced by Grant Sanderson, also creator of the 3Blue1Brown educational math videos. While Grant Sanderson continues to maintain his own repository, we recommend this version for its continued development, improved features, enhanced documentation, and more active community-driven maintenance. If you would like to study how Grant makes his videos, head over to his repository ([3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)).

## Installation

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; These instructions are for the community version _only_. Trying to use these instructions to install [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) or instructions there to install this version will cause problems. Read [this](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#why-are-there-different-versions-of-manim) and decide which version you wish to install, then only follow the instructions for your desired version.

Manim requires a few dependencies that must be installed prior to using it. If you
want to try it out first before installing it locally, you can do so
[in our online Jupyter environment](https://try.manim.community/).

For local installation, please visit the [Documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)
and follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

## Usage

Manim is an extremely versatile package. The following is an example `Scene` you can construct:

```python
from manim import *


class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square()
        square.flip(RIGHT)
        square.rotate(-3 * TAU / 8)
        circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)

        self.play(Create(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, circle))
        self.play(FadeOut(square))
```

In order to view the output of this scene, save the code in a file called `example.py`. Then, run the following in a terminal window:

```sh
manim -p -ql example.py SquareToCircle
```

You should see your native video player program pop up and play a simple scene in which a square is transformed into a circle. You may find some more simple examples within this
[GitHub repository](example_scenes). You can also visit the [official gallery](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html) for more advanced examples.

Manim also ships with a `%%manim` IPython magic which allows to use it conveniently in JupyterLab (as well as classic Jupyter) notebooks. See the
[corresponding documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.utils.ipython_magic.ManimMagic.html) for some guidance and
[try it out online](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ManimCommunity/jupyter_examples/HEAD?filepath=basic_example_scenes.ipynb).

## Command line arguments

The general usage of Manim is as follows:

![manim-illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ManimCommunity/manim/main/docs/source/_static/command.png)

The `-p` flag in the command above is for previewing, meaning the video file will automatically open when it is done rendering. The `-ql` flag is for a faster rendering at a lower quality.

Some other useful flags include:

- `-s` to skip to the end and just show the final frame.
- `-n &lt;number&gt;` to skip ahead to the `n`&#039;th animation of a scene.
- `-f` show the file in the file browser.

For a thorough list of command line arguments, visit the [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/configuration.html).

## Documentation

Documentation is in progress at [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.manim.community/).

## Docker

The community also maintains a docker image (`manimcommunity/manim`), which can be found [on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manimcommunity/manim).
Instructions on how to install and use it can be found in our [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/docker.html).

Issues and feature requests are welcome to the repo.

## 💡 Command line usage

The `gitingest` command line tool allows you to analyze codebases and create a text dump of their contents.

```bash
# Basic usage (writes to digest.txt by default)
gitingest /path/to/directory

# From URL
gitingest https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest

# or from specific subdirectory
gitingest https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest/tree/main/src/gitingest/utils
```

For private repositories, use the `--token/-t` option.

```bash
# Get your token from https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
gitingest https://github.com/username/private-repo --token github_pat_...

# Or set it as an environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
gitingest https://github.com/username/private-repo
```

By default, the digest is written to a text file (`digest.txt`) in your current working directory. You can customize the output in two ways:

- Use `--output/-o &lt;filename&gt;` to write to a specific file.
- Use `--output/-o -` to output directly to `STDOUT` (useful for piping to other tools).

See more options and usage details with:

```bash
gitingest --help
```

## 🐍 Python package usage

```python
# Synchronous usage
from gitingest import ingest

summary, tree, content = ingest(&quot;path/to/directory&quot;)

# or from URL
summary, tree, content = ingest(&quot;https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest&quot;)

# or from a specific subdirectory
summary, tree, content = ingest(&quot;https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest/tree/main/src/gitingest/utils&quot;)
```

For private repositories, you can pass a token:

```python
# Using token parameter
summary, tree, content = ingest(&quot;https://github.com/username/private-repo&quot;, token=&quot;github_pat_...&quot;)

# Or set it as an environment variable
import os
os.environ[&quot;GITHUB_TOKEN&quot;] = &quot;github_pat_...&quot;
summary, tree, content = ingest(&quot;https://github.com/username/private-repo&quot;)
```

By default, this won&#039;t write a file but can be enabled with the `output` argument.

```python
# Asynchronous usage
from gitingest import ingest_async
import asyncio

result = asyncio.run(ingest_async(&quot;path/to/directory&quot;))
```

### Jupyter notebook usage

```python
from gitingest import ingest_async

# Use await directly in Jupyter
summary, tree, content = await ingest_async(&quot;path/to/directory&quot;)

```

This is because Jupyter notebooks are asynchronous by default.

## 🐳 Self-host

1. Build the image:

   ``` bash
   docker build -t gitingest .
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ``` bash
   docker run -d --name gitingest -p 8000:8000 gitingest
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

If you are hosting it on a domain, you can specify the allowed hostnames via env variable `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

   ```bash
   # Default: &quot;gitingest.com, *.gitingest.com, localhost, 127.0.0.1&quot;.
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=&quot;example.com, localhost, 127.0.0.1&quot;
   ```

## UPDATE
You can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)

If you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program

For other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer to their documentation

&lt;a id=&quot;update-channels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.

* `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.
* The `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project&#039;s new patches and changes. This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip&#039;s `--pre` flag).
* The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).

When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.

You may also use `--update-to &lt;repository&gt;` (`&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.

Example usage:

* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release
* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`
* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel
* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`

**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:
```
# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly

# To install nightly with pip:
python3 -m pip install -U --pre &quot;yt-dlp[default]&quot;
```

## DEPENDENCIES
Python versions 3.9+ (CPython) and 3.10+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.

&lt;!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created
&lt;!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x&gt;
On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt;

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are highly recommended

### Strongly recommended

* [**ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**](https://www.ffmpeg.org) - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds

    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)

To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms.

The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with **\*** included.

If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the `--verbose` output


## COMPILE

### Standalone PyInstaller Builds
To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and `pyinstaller` (plus any of yt-dlp&#039;s [optional dependencies](#dependencies) if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used.

You can run the following commands:

```
python3 devscripts/install_deps.py --include pyinstaller
python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python3 -m bundle.pyinstaller
```

On some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`.

`python -m bundle.pyinstaller` accepts any arguments that can be passed to `pyinstaller`, such as `--onefile/-F` or `--onedir/-D`, which is further [documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate).

**Note**: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 [do not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.

**Important**: Running `pyinstaller` directly **instead of** using `python -m bundle.pyinstaller` is **not** officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.

### Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)
You will need the build tools `python` (3.9+), `zip`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`\* and `pytest`\*.

After installing these, simply run `make`.

You can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with **\*** are not needed for this)

### Related scripts

* **`devscripts/install_deps.py`** - Install dependencies for yt-dlp.
* **`devscripts/update-version.py`** - Update the version number based on the current date.
* **`devscripts/set-variant.py`** - Set the build variant of the executable.
* **`devscripts/make_changelog.py`** - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update `CONTRIBUTORS` file.
* **`devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`** - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable `YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS` to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading.

Note: See their `--help` for more info.

### Forking the project
If you fork the project on GitHub, you can run your fork&#039;s [build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatic

# BunkerWeb

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Overview banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/intro-overview.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

BunkerWeb is a next-generation and open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF).

Being a full-featured web server (based on [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) under the hood), it will protect your web services to make them &quot;secure by default&quot;. BunkerWeb integrates seamlessly into your existing environments ([Linux](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#linux), [Docker](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#docker), [Swarm](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#swarm), [Kubernetes](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#kubernetes), …) and is fully configurable (don&#039;t panic, there is an [awesome web UI](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/web-ui/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github) if you don&#039;t like the CLI) to meet your own use-cases . In other words, cybersecurity is no more a hassle.

BunkerWeb contains primary [security features](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/advanced/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#security-tuning) as part of the core but can be easily extended with additional ones thanks to a [plugin system](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/plugins/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github).

# Concepts

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Concepts banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/concepts.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

You will find more information about the key concepts of BunkerWeb in the [documentation](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/concepts/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github).

## Integrations

The first concept is the integration of BunkerWeb into the target environment. We prefer to use the word &quot;integration&quot; instead of &quot;installation&quot; because one of the goals of BunkerWeb is to integrate seamlessly into existing environments.

The following integrations are officially supported :

- [Docker](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#docker)
- [Linux](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#linux)
- [Docker autoconf](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#docker-autoconf)
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#kubernetes)
- [Swarm](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#swarm)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#microsoft-azure)

## Settings

Once BunkerWeb is integrated into your environment, you will need to configure it to serve and protect your web applications.

The configuration of BunkerWeb is done by using what we call the &quot;settings&quot; or &quot;variables&quot;. Each setting is identified by a name such as `AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT` or `USE_ANTIBOT`. You can assign values to the settings to configure BunkerWeb.

Here is a dummy example of a BunkerWeb configuration :

```conf
SERVER_NAME=www.example.com
AUTO_LETS_ENCRYPT=yes
USE_ANTIBOT=captcha
REFERRER_POLICY=no-referrer
USE_MODSECURITY=no
USE_GZIP=yes
USE_BROTLI=no
```

You will find an easy to use settings generator at [config.bunkerweb.io](https://config.bunkerweb.io/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github).

## Multisite mode

The multisite mode is a crucial concept to understand when using BunkerWeb. Because the goal is to protect web applications, we intrinsically inherit the concept of &quot;virtual host&quot; or &quot;vhost&quot; (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting)) which makes it possible to serve multiple web applications from a single (or a cluster of) instance.

By default, the multisite mode of BunkerWeb is disabled which means that only one web application will be served and all the settings will be applied to it. The typical use case is when you have a single application to protect : you don&#039;t have to worry about the multisite and the default behavior should be the right one for you.

When multisite mode is enabled, BunkerWeb will serve and protect multiple web applications. Each web application is identified by a unique server name and have its own set of settings. The typical use case is when you have multiple applications to protect and you want to use a single (or a cluster depending of the integration) instance of BunkerWeb.

## Custom configurations

Because meeting all the use cases only using the settings is not an option (even with [external plugins](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/plugins/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github)), you can use custom configurations to solve your specific challenges.

Under the hood, BunkerWeb uses the notorious NGINX web server, that&#039;s why you can leverage its configuration system for your specific needs. Custom NGINX configurations can be included in different [contexts](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/#contexts) like HTTP or server (all servers and/or specific server block).

Another core component of BunkerWeb is the ModSecurity Web Application Firewall : you can also use custom configurations to fix some false positives or add custom rules for example.

## Database

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Database model&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/bunkerweb_db.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

State of the current configuration of BunkerWeb is stored in a backend database which contains the following data :

- Settings defined for all the services
- Custom configurations
- BunkerWeb instances
- Metadata about jobs execution
- Cached files

The following backend database are supported : SQLite, MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL

## Scheduler

To make things automagically work together, a dedicated service called the scheduler is in charge of :

- Storing the settings and custom configurations inside the database
- Executing various tasks (called jobs)
- Generating a configuration which is understood by BunkerWeb
- Being the intermediary for other services (like web UI or autoconf)

In other words, the scheduler is the brain of BunkerWeb.

# Setup

## BunkerWeb Cloud

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Docker banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/bunkerweb-cloud.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

BunkerWeb Cloud is the easiest way to get started with BunkerWeb. It offers you a fully managed BunkerWeb service with no hassle. Think of a like a BunkerWeb-as-a-Service !

You will find more information about BunkerWeb Cloud beta [here](https://www.bunkerweb.io/cloud?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=docs) and you can apply for free [in the BunkerWeb panel](https://panel.bunkerweb.io/order/bunkerweb-cloud/14?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=docs).

## Linux

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Linux banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/integration-linux.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

List of supported Linux distros :

- Debian 12 &quot;Bookworm&quot;
- Ubuntu 22.04 &quot;Noble&quot;
- Ubuntu 24.04 &quot;Jammy&quot;
- Fedora 40
- Fedora 41
- RHEL 8.9
- RHEL 9.4

You will find more information in the [Linux section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.5.10/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#linux) of the documentation.

## Docker

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Docker banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/integration-docker.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

We provide ready to use prebuilt images for x64, x86, armv7 and arm64 platforms on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bunkerity).

Docker integration key concepts are :

- **Environment variables** to configure BunkerWeb
- **Scheduler** container to store configuration and execute jobs
- **Networks** to expose ports for clients and connect to upstream web services

You will find more information in the [Docker integration section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#docker) of the documentation.

## Docker autoconf

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Docker autoconf banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/integration-autoconf.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

The downside of using environment variables is that the container needs to be recreated each time there is an update which is not very convenient. To counter that issue, you can use another image called **autoconf** which will listen for Docker events and automatically reconfigure BunkerWeb in real-time without recreating the container.

Instead of defining environment variables for the BunkerWeb container, you simply add **labels** to your web applications containers and the **autoconf** will &quot;automagically&quot; take care of the rest.

You will find more information in the [Docker autoconf section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#docker-autoconf) of the documentation.

## Kubernetes

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Kubernetes banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/integration-kubernetes.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

The autoconf acts as an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) and will configure the BunkerWeb instances according to the [Ingress resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). It also monitors other Kubernetes objects like [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) for custom configurations.

The official [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/) for BunkerWeb is available in the [bunkerity/bunkerweb-helm repository](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb-helm).

You will find more information in the [Kubernetes section](https://docs.bunkerweb.io/1.6.1/integrations/?utm_campaign=self&amp;utm_source=github#kubernetes) of the documentation.

## Microsoft Azure

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Azure banner&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1/docs/assets/img/integration-azure.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

BunkerWeb is referenced in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/fr-fr/marketplace/apps/bunkerity.bunkerweb?tab=Overview) and a ARM template is available in the [misc folder](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb/raw/v1.6.1

# 🚀 Quick Start with a Computer-Use Agent UI

**Need to automate desktop tasks? Launch the Computer-Use Agent UI with a single command.**



### Option 1: Fully-managed install with Docker (recommended)
*Docker-based guided install for quick use*

**macOS/Linux/Windows (via WSL):**
```bash
# Requires Docker
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/scripts/playground-docker.sh)&quot;
```
This script will guide you through setup using Docker containers and launch the Computer-Use Agent UI.

---

### Option 2: [Dev Container](./.devcontainer/README.md)
*Best for contributors and development*

This repository includes a [Dev Container](./.devcontainer/README.md) configuration that simplifies setup to a few steps:

1. **Install the Dev Containers extension ([VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or [WindSurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/advanced#dev-containers-beta))**
2. **Open the repository in the Dev Container:**
    - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `⌘+Shift+P` on macOS)
    - Select `Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...` and paste the repository URL: `https://github.com/trycua/cua.git` (if not cloned) or `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...` (if git cloned).
     &gt; **Note**: On WindSurf, the post install hook might not run automatically. If so, run `/bin/bash .devcontainer/post-install.sh` manually.
3. **Open the VS Code workspace:** Once the post-install.sh is done running, open the `.vscode/py.code-workspace` workspace and press ![Open Workspace](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/923bdd43-8c8f-4060-8d78-75bfa302b48c)

&lt;br/&gt;

# 🐍 Usage Guide

Follow these steps to use C/ua in your own Python code. See [Developer Guide](./docs/Developer-Guide.md) for building from source.

### Step 1: Install Lume CLI

```bash
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)&quot;
```

Lume CLI manages high-performance macOS/Linux VMs with near-native speed on Apple Silicon.

### Step 2: Pull the macOS CUA Image

```bash
lume pull macos-sequoia-cua:latest
```

The macOS CUA image contains the default Mac apps and the Computer Server for easy automation.

### Step 3: Install Python SDK

```bash
pip install &quot;cua-computer[all]&quot; &quot;cua-agent[all]&quot;
```

### Step 4: Use in Your Code

```python
from computer import Computer
from agent import ComputerAgent, LLM

async def main():
    # Start a local macOS VM
    computer = Computer(os_type=&quot;macos&quot;)
    await computer.run()

    # Or with C/ua Cloud Container
    computer = Computer(
      os_type=&quot;linux&quot;,
      api_key=&quot;your_cua_api_key_here&quot;,
      name=&quot;your_container_name_here&quot;
    )

    # Example: Direct control of a macOS VM with Computer
    await computer.interface.left_click(100, 200)
    await computer.interface.type_text(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
    screenshot_bytes = await computer.interface.screenshot()
    
    # Example: Create and run an agent locally using mlx-community/UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit
    agent = ComputerAgent(
      computer=computer,
      loop=&quot;uitars&quot;,
      model=LLM(provider=&quot;mlxvlm&quot;, name=&quot;mlx-community/UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit&quot;)
    )
    async for result in agent.run(&quot;Find the trycua/cua repository on GitHub and follow the quick start guide&quot;):
        print(result)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

            <p>🔥 The fastest and powerful Python library for Instagram Private API 2025 with HikerAPI SaaS</p>
            <p>Language: Python</p>
            <p>Stars: 5,142</p>
            <p>Forks: 757</p>
            <p>Stars today: 16 stars today</p>
            <h2>README</h2><pre>If you want to work with Instagrapi (business interests), we strongly advise you to prefer [HikerAPI SaaS](https://hikerapi.com/p/bkXQlaVe) project.
However, you won&#039;t need to spend weeks or even months setting it up.
The best service available today is [HikerAPI SaaS](https://hikerapi.com/p/bkXQlaVe), which handles 4–5 million daily requests, provides support around-the-clock, and offers partners a special rate.
In many instances, our clients tried to save money and preferred instagrapi, but in our experience, they ultimately returned to [HikerAPI SaaS](https://hikerapi.com/p/bkXQlaVe) after spending much more time and money.
It will be difficult to find good accounts, good proxies, or resolve challenges, and IG will ban your accounts.

The instagrapi more suits for testing or research than a working business!

✨ [aiograpi - Asynchronous Python library for Instagram Private API](https://github.com/subzeroid/aiograpi) ✨

[&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/header_model_release.png&quot; alt=&quot;BitNet Model on Hugging Face&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T)

Try it out via this [demo](https://bitnet-demo.azurewebsites.net/), or build and run it on your own [CPU](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-source) or [GPU](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/blob/main/gpu/README.md).

bitnet.cpp is the official inference framework for 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). It offers a suite of optimized kernels, that support **fast** and **lossless** inference of 1.58-bit models on CPU and GPU (NPU support will coming next).

The first release of bitnet.cpp is to support inference on CPUs. bitnet.cpp achieves speedups of **1.37x** to **5.07x** on ARM CPUs, with larger models experiencing greater performance gains. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption by **55.4%** to **70.0%**, further boosting overall efficiency. On x86 CPUs, speedups range from **2.37x** to **6.17x** with energy reductions between **71.9%** to **82.2%**. Furthermore, bitnet.cpp can run a 100B BitNet b1.58 model on a single CPU, achieving speeds comparable to human reading (5-7 tokens per second), significantly enhancing the potential for running LLMs on local devices. Please refer to the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16144) for more details.

&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/intel_performance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;m2_performance&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;

&gt;The tested models are dummy setups used in a research context to demonstrate the inference performance of bitnet.cpp.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) framework. We would like to thank all the authors for their contributions to the open-source community. Also, bitnet.cpp&#039;s kernels are built on top of the Lookup Table methodologies pioneered in [T-MAC](https://github.com/microsoft/T-MAC/). For inference of general low-bit LLMs beyond ternary models, we recommend using T-MAC.

                        (When this option is turned on, the prompt specified by -p will be used as the system prompt.)
&lt;/pre&gt;

### Benchmark
We provide scripts to run the inference benchmark providing a model.

```  
usage: e2e_benchmark.py -m MODEL [-n N_TOKEN] [-p N_PROMPT] [-t THREADS]  
   
Setup the environment for running the inference  
   
required arguments:  
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL  
                        Path to the model file. 
   
optional arguments:  
  -h, --help  
                        Show this help message and exit. 
  -n N_TOKEN, --n-token N_TOKEN  
                        Number of generated tokens. 
  -p N_PROMPT, --n-prompt N_PROMPT  
                        Prompt to generate text from. 
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS  
                        Number of threads to use. 
```  
   
Here&#039;s a brief explanation of each argument:  
   
- `-m`, `--model`: The path to the model file. This is a required argument that must be provided when running the script.  
- `-n`, `--n-token`: The number of tokens to generate during the inference. It is an optional argument with a default value of 128.  
- `-p`, `--n-prompt`: The number of prompt tokens to use for generating text. This is an optional argument with a default value of 512.  
- `-t`, `--threads`: The number of threads to use for running the inference. It is an optional argument with a default value of 2.  
- `-h`, `--help`: Show the help message and exit. Use this argument to display usage information.  
   
For example:  
   
```sh  
python utils/e2e_benchmark.py -m /path/to/model -n 200 -p 256 -t 4  
```  
   
This command would run the inference benchmark using the model located at `/path/to/model`, generating 200 tokens from a 256 token prompt, utilizing 4 threads.  

For the model layout that do not supported by any public model, we provide scripts to generate a dummy model with the given model layout, and run the benchmark on your machine:

```bash
python utils/generate-dummy-bitnet-model.py models/bitnet_b1_58-large --outfile models/dummy-bitnet-125m.tl1.gguf --outtype tl1 --model-size 125M

# Run benchmark with the generated model, use -m to specify the model path, -p to specify the prompt processed, -n to specify the number of token to generate
python utils/e2e_benchmark.py -m models/dummy-bitnet-125m.tl1.gguf -p 512 -n 128
```

### Convert from `.safetensors` Checkpoints

```sh
# Prepare the .safetensors model file
huggingface-cli download microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-bf16 --local-dir ./models/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-bf16

# Convert to gguf model
python ./utils/convert-helper-bitnet.py ./models/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-bf16
```

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)📌 

#### Q1: The build dies with errors building llama.cpp due to issues with std::chrono in log.cpp?

**A:**
This is an issue introduced in recent version of llama.cpp. Please refer to this [commit](https://github.com/tinglou/llama.cpp/commit/4e3db1e3d78cc1bcd22bcb3af54bd2a4628dd323) in the [discussion](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/issues/1942) to fix this issue.

#### Q2: How to build with clang in conda environment on windows?

**A:** 
Before building the project, verify your clang installation and access to Visual Studio tools by running:
```
clang -v
```

This command checks that you are using the correct version of clang and that the Visual Studio tools are available. If you see an error message such as:
```
&#039;clang&#039; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

It indicates that your command line window is not properly initialized for Visual Studio tools.

• If you are using Command Prompt, run:
```
&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat&quot; -startdir=none -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64
```

• If you are using Windows PowerShell, run the following commands:
```
Import-Module &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll&quot; Enter-VsDevShell 3f0e31ad -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments &quot;-arch=x64 -host_arch=x64&quot;
```

These steps will initialize your environment and allow you to use the correct Visual Studio tools.

## 🔍 How to Use AutoAgent

&lt;span id=&#039;user-mode&#039;/&gt;

### 1. `user mode` (SOTA 🏆 Open Deep Research)

AutoAgent have an out-of-the-box multi-agent system, which you could choose `user mode` in the start page to use it. This multi-agent system is a general AI assistant, having the same functionality with **OpenAI&#039;s Deep Research** and the comparable performance with it in [GAIA](https://gaia-benchmark-leaderboard.hf.space/) benchmark. 

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Matches Deep Research using Claude 3.5 rather than OpenAI&#039;s o3 model.
- 🔄 **Model Flexibility**: Compatible with any LLM (including Deepseek-R1, Grok, Gemini, etc.)
- 💰 **Cost-Effective**: Open-source alternative to Deep Research&#039;s $200/month subscription
- 🎯 **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-deploy CLI interface for seamless interaction
- 📁 **File Support**: Handles file uploads for enhanced data interaction

  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;🎥 Deep Research (aka User Mode)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;span id=&#039;agent-editor&#039;/&gt;

### 2. `agent editor` (Agent Creation without Workflow)

The most distinctive feature of AutoAgent is its natural language customization capability. Unlike other agent frameworks, AutoAgent allows you to create tools, agents, and workflows using natural language alone. Simply choose `agent editor` or `workflow editor` mode to start your journey of building agents through conversations.

You can use `agent editor` as shown in the following figure.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/agent_editor/1-requirement.png&quot; alt=&quot;requirement&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Input what kind of agent you want to create.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/agent_editor/2-profiling.png&quot; alt=&quot;profiling&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Automated agent profiling.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/agent_editor/3-profiles.png&quot; alt=&quot;profiles&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Output the agent profiles.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/agent_editor/4-tools.png&quot; alt=&quot;tools&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Create the desired tools.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/agent_editor/5-task.png&quot; alt=&quot;task&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Input what do you want to complete with the agent. (Optional)&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/agent_editor/6-output-next.png&quot; alt=&quot;output&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Create the desired agent(s) and go to the next step.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;span id=&#039;workflow-editor&#039;/&gt;

### 3. `workflow editor` (Agent Creation with Workflow)

You can also create the agent workflows using natural language description with the `workflow editor` mode, as shown in the following figure. (Tips: this mode does not support tool creation temporarily.)

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/workflow_editor/1-requirement.png&quot; alt=&quot;requirement&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Input what kind of workflow you want to create.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/workflow_editor/2-profiling.png&quot; alt=&quot;profiling&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Automated workflow profiling.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/workflow_editor/3-profiles.png&quot; alt=&quot;profiles&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Output the workflow profiles.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/workflow_editor/4-task.png&quot; alt=&quot;task&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Input what do you want to complete with the workflow. (Optional)&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/workflow_editor/5-output-next.png&quot; alt=&quot;output&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;Create the desired workflow(s) and go to the next step.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;span id=&#039;quick-start&#039;/&gt;

## ⚡ Quick Start

&lt;span id=&#039;installation&#039;/&gt;

### Installation

#### AutoAgent Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent.git
cd AutoAgent
pip install -e .
```

#### Docker Installation

We use Docker to containerize the agent-interactive environment. So please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) first. You don&#039;t need to manually pull the pre-built image, because we have let Auto-Deep-Research **automatically pull the pre-built image based on your architecture of your machine**.

&lt;span id=&#039;api-keys-setup&#039;/&gt;

### API Keys Setup

Create an environment variable file, just like `.env.template`, and set the API keys for the LLMs you want to use. Not every LLM API Key is required, use what you need.

```bash
# Required Github Tokens of your own
GITHUB_AI_TOKEN=

# Optional API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
XAI_API_KEY=
```

&lt;span id=&#039;start-with-cli-mode&#039;/&gt;

### Start with CLI Mode

&gt; [🚨 **News**: ] We have updated a more easy-to-use command to start the CLI mode and fix the bug of different LLM providers from issues. You can follow the following steps to start the CLI mode with different LLM providers with much less configuration.

#### Command Options:

You can run `auto main` to start full part of AutoAgent, including `user mode`, `agent editor` and `workflow editor`. Btw, you can also run `auto deep-research` to start more lightweight `user mode`, just like the [Auto-Deep-Research](https://github.com/HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research) project. Some configuration of this command is shown below. 

- `--container_name`: Name of the Docker container (default: &#039;deepresearch&#039;)
- `--port`: Port for the container (default: 12346)
- `COMPLETION_MODEL`: Specify the LLM model to use, you should follow the name of [Litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) to set the model name. (Default: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode for detailed logs (default: False)
- `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the LLM provider (default: None)
- `FN_CALL`: Enable function calling (default: None). Most of time, you could ignore this option because we have already set the default value based on the model name.
- `git_clone`: Clone the AutoAgent repository to the local environment (only support with the `auto main` command, default: True)
- `test_pull_name`: The name of the test pull. (only support with the `auto main` command, default: &#039;autoagent_mirror&#039;)

#### More details about `git_clone` and `test_pull_name`] 

In the `agent editor` and `workflow editor` mode, we should clone a mirror of the AutoAgent repository to the local agent-interactive environment and let our **AutoAgent** automatically update the AutoAgent itself, such as creating new tools, agents and workflows. So if you want to use the `agent editor` and `workflow editor` mode, you should set the `git_clone` to True and set the `test_pull_name` to &#039;autoagent_mirror&#039; or other branches.

#### `auto main` with different LLM Providers

Then I will show you how to use the full part of AutoAgent with the `auto main` command and different LLM providers. If you want to use the `auto deep-research` command, you can refer to the [Auto-Deep-Research](https://github.com/HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research) project for more details.

We recommend using OpenRouter as LLM provider of DeepSeek-R1 temporarily. Because official API of DeepSeek-R1 can not be used efficiently.

* set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1 auto main
```

##### DeepSeek

* set the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
```

* run the following command to start Auto-Deep-Research.

```bash
COMPLETION_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat auto main
```


After the CLI mode is started, you can see the start page of AutoAgent: 

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/AutoAgentnew-intro.pdf&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start Page of AutoAgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

### Tips

#### Import browser cookies to browser environment

You can import the browser cookies to the browser environment to let the agent better access some specific websites. For more details, please refer to the [cookies](./AutoAgent/environment/cookie_json/README.md) folder.

#### Add your own API keys for third-party Tool Platforms

If you want to create tools from the third-party tool platforms, such as RapidAPI, you should subscribe tools from the platform and add your own API keys by running [process_tool_docs.py](./process_tool_docs.py). 

```bash
python process_tool_docs.py
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Rome wasn&#039;t built in a day. AutoAgent stands on the shoulders of giants, and we are deeply grateful for the outstanding work that came before us. Our framework architecture draws inspiration from [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm), while our user mode&#039;s three-agent design benefits from [Magentic-one](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one)&#039;s insights. We&#039;ve also learned from [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) for documentation structure and many other excellent projects for agent-environment interaction design, among others. We express our sincere gratitude and respect to all these pioneering works that have been instrumental in shaping AutoAgent.

### For end users

- **Clean &amp; Minimalistic UI**: A user-friendly interface for RAG-based QA.
- **Support for Various LLMs**: Compatible with LLM API providers (OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Cohere, etc.) and local LLMs (via `ollama` and `llama-cpp-python`).
- **Easy Installation**: Simple scripts to get you started quickly.

### For developers

- **Framework for RAG Pipelines**: Tools to build your own RAG-based document QA pipeline.
- **Customizable UI**: See your RAG pipeline in action with the provided UI, built with &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;Gradio &lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
- **Gradio Theme**: If you use Gradio for development, check out our theme here: [kotaemon-gradio-theme](https://github.com/lone17/kotaemon-gradio-theme).

## Key Features

- **Host your own document QA (RAG) web-UI**: Support multi-user login, organize your files in private/public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others.

- **Organize your LLM &amp; Embedding models**: Support both local LLMs &amp; popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq).

- **Hybrid RAG pipeline**: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text &amp; vector) retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality.

- **Multi-modal QA support**: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI).

- **Advanced citations with document preview**: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the _in-browser PDF viewer_ with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles.

- **Support complex reasoning methods**: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with `ReAct`, `ReWOO` and other agents.

- **Configurable settings UI**: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval &amp; generation process on the UI (incl. prompts).

- **Extensible**: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing &amp; retrieval. `GraphRAG` indexing pipeline is provided as an example.

## Installation

&gt; If you are not a developer and just want to use the app, please check out our easy-to-follow [User Guide](https://cinnamon.github.io/kotaemon/). Download the `.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/releases/latest) to get all the newest features and bug fixes.

### System requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) &gt;= 3.10
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): optional, if you [install with Docker](#with-docker-recommended)
3. [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation#full-installation) if you want to process files other than `.pdf`, `.html`, `.mhtml`, and `.xlsx` documents. Installation steps differ depending on your operating system. Please visit the link and follow the specific instructions provided there.

### With Docker (recommended)

1. We support both `lite` &amp; `full` version of Docker images. With `full` version, the extra packages of `unstructured` will be installed, which can support additional file types (`.doc`, `.docx`, ...) but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the `lite` image should work well in most cases.

   - To use the `full` version.

     ```bash
     docker run \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
     -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
     -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
     ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-full
     ```

   - To use the `full` version with bundled **Ollama** for _local / private RAG_.

     ```bash
     # change image name to
     docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-ollama
     ```

   - To use the `lite` version.

   ```bash
    # change image name to
    docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

2. We currently support and test two platforms: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (for newer Mac). You can specify the platform by passing `--platform` in the `docker run` command. For example:

   ```bash
   # To run docker with platform linux/arm64
   docker run \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
   -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
   -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
   --platform linux/arm64 \
   ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

3. Once everything is set up correctly, you can go to `http://localhost:7860/` to access the WebUI.

4. We use [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store docker images, all images can be found [here.](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/pkgs/container/kotaemon)

### Without Docker

1. Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment.

   ```shell
   # optional (setup env)
   conda create -n kotaemon python=3.10
   conda activate kotaemon

   # clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon
   cd kotaemon

   pip install -e &quot;libs/kotaemon[all]&quot;
   pip install -e &quot;libs/ktem&quot;
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of this project. Use `.env.example` as a template

   The `.env` file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app (e.g. deploy the app on HF hub). The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs.

3. (Optional) To enable in-browser `PDF_JS` viewer, download [PDF_JS_DIST](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v4.0.379/pdfjs-4.0.379-dist.zip) then extract it to `libs/ktem/ktem/assets/prebuilt`

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/pdf-viewer-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;pdf-setup&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;

4. Start the web server:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

   - The app will be automatically launched in your browser.
   - Default username and password are both `admin`. You can set up additional users directly through the UI.

   ![Chat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/chat-tab.png)

5. Check the `Resources` tab and `LLMs and Embeddings` and ensure that your `api_key` value is set correctly from your `.env` file. If it is not set, you can set it there.

### Setup GraphRAG

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Official MS GraphRAG indexing only works with OpenAI or Ollama API.
&gt; We recommend most users to use NanoGraphRAG implementation for straightforward integration with Kotaemon.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup Nano GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install nano-GraphRAG: `pip install nano-graphrag`
- `nano-graphrag` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_NANO_GRAPHRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from NanoGraphRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup LIGHTRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install LightRAG: `pip install git+https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git`
- `LightRAG` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_LIGHTRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from LightRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup MS GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- **Non-Docker Installation**: If you are not using Docker, install GraphRAG with the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install &quot;graphrag&lt;=0.3.6&quot; future
  ```

- **Setting Up API KEY**: To use the GraphRAG retriever feature, ensure you set the `GRAPHRAG_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this directly in your environment or by adding it to a `.env` file.
- **Using Local Models and Custom Settings**: If you want to use GraphRAG with local models (like `Ollama`) or customize the default LLM and other configurations, set the `USE_CUSTOMIZED_GRAPHRAG_SETTING` environment variable to true. Then, adjust your settings in the `settings.yaml.example` file.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Setup Local Models (for local/private RAG)

See [Local model setup](docs/local_model.md).

### Setup multimodal document parsing (OCR, table parsing, figure extraction)

These options are available:

- [Azure Document Intelligence (API)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
- [Adobe PDF Extract (API)](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/)
- [Docling (local, open-source)](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling)
  - To use Docling, first install required dependencies: `pip install docling`

Select corresponding loaders in `Settings -&gt; Retrieval Settings -&gt; File loader`

### Customize your application

- By default, all application data is stored in the `./ktem_app_data` folder. You can back up or copy this folder to transfer your installation to a new machine.

- For advanced users or specific use cases, you can customize these files:

  - `flowsettings.py`
  - `.env`

#### `flowsettings.py`

This file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example
[here](flowsettings.py) as the starting point.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Notable settings&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
# setup your preferred document store (with full-text search capabilities)
KH_DOCSTORE=(Elasticsearch | LanceDB | SimpleFileDocumentStore)

# setup your preferred vectorstore (for vector-based search)
KH_VECTORSTORE=(ChromaDB | LanceDB | InMemory | Milvus | Qdrant)

# Enable / disable multimodal QA
KH_REASONINGS_USE_MULTIMODAL=True

# Setup your new reasoning pipeline or modify existing one.
KH_REASONINGS = [
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullDecomposeQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.react.ReactAgentPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.rewoo.RewooAgentPipeline&quot;,
]
```

&lt;/details&gt;

#### `.env`

This file provides another way to configure your models and credentials.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Configure model via the .env file&lt;/summary&gt;

- Alternatively, you can configure the models via the `.env` file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in the folder of the application. If you don&#039;t see it, you can create one.

- Currently, the following providers are supported:

  - **OpenAI**

    In the `.env` file, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your OpenAI API key in order
    to enable access to OpenAI&#039;s models. There are other variables that can be modified,
    please feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should
    work for most people.

    ```shell
    OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
    OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your OpenAI API key here&gt;
    OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
    OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Azure OpenAI**

    For OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API
    key. Your might also need to provide your developments&#039; name for the chat model and the
    embedding model depending on how you set up Azure development.

    ```shell
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
    AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-35-turbo
    AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Local Models**

    - Using `ollama` OpenAI compatible server:

      - Install [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and start the application.

      - Pull your model, for example:

        ```shell
        ollama pull llama3.1:8b
        ollama pull nomic-embed-text
        ```

      - Set the model names on web UI and make it as default:

        ![Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/models.png)

    - Using `GGUF` with `llama-cpp-python`

      You can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Currently, these model formats are supported:

      - GGUF

        You should choose a model whose size is less than your device&#039;s memory and should leave
        about 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available,
        then you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to
        give better generation but also take more processing time.

        Here are some recommendations and their size in memory:

      - [Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen1_5-1_8b-chat-q8_0.gguf?download=true): around 2 GB

        Add a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web UI.

  &lt;/details&gt;

### Adding your own RAG pipeline

#### Custom Reasoning Pipeline

1. Check the default pipeline implementation in [here](libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/simple.py). You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work.
2. Add new `.py` implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/` and later include it in `flowssettings` to enable it on the UI.

#### Custom Indexing Pipeline

- Check sample implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/graph`

&gt; (more instruction WIP).
