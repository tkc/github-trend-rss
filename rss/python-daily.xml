            <h2>README</h2><pre># Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1447831134212984903?color=5865F2&amp;label=discord&amp;labelColor=black&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/gdXc48gSyT)

Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka &quot;safety alignment&quot;) from
transformer-based language models without expensive post-training.
It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known
as &quot;abliteration&quot; ([Arditi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717)),
with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).

This approach enables Heretic to work **completely automatically.** Heretic
finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of
refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a
decensored model that retains as much of the original model&#039;s intelligence
as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer
internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program
can use Heretic to decensor language models.

&lt;img width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;715&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a5efa-d6be-4705-a817-63332afb2d15&quot; /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce
decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually
by human experts:

| Model | Refusals for &quot;harmful&quot; prompts | KL divergence from original model for &quot;harmless&quot; prompts |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| [google/gemma-3-12b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it) (original) | 97/100 | 0 *(by definition)* |
| [mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2) | 3/100 | 1.04 |
| [huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated](https://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated) | 3/100 | 0.45 |
| **[p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic) (ours)** | **3/100** | **0.16** |

The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same
level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower
KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model&#039;s capabilities.
*(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic&#039;s built-in evaluation functionality,
e.g. `heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic`.
Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent.
The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)*

Of course, mathematical metrics and automated benchmarks never tell the whole
story, and are no substitute for human evaluation. Models generated with
Heretic have been well-received by users (links and emphasis added):

&gt; &quot;I was skeptical before, but I just downloaded
&gt; [**GPT-OSS 20B Heretic**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic)
&gt; model and holy shit. It gives properly formatted long responses to sensitive topics,
&gt; using the exact uncensored words that you would expect from an uncensored model,
&gt; produces markdown format tables with details and whatnot. Looks like this is
&gt; the best abliterated version of this model so far...&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/np6tba6/)

&gt; &quot;[**Heretic GPT 20b**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic)
&gt; seems to be the best uncensored model I have tried yet. It doesn&#039;t destroy a
&gt; the model&#039;s intelligence and it is answering prompts normally would be
&gt; rejected by the base model.&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/npe9jng/)

&gt; &quot;[[**Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic)]
&gt; Has been the best unquantized abliterated model that I have been able to run on 16gb vram.&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1phjxca/im_calling_these_people_out_right_now/nt06tji/)

Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and
several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models,
models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.

You can find a collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic
[on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary).


## Usage

Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate
for your hardware. Then run:

```
pip install -U heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
```

Replace `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` with whatever model you want to decensor.

The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however,
Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for
greater control. Run `heretic --help` to see available command-line options,
or look at [`config.default.toml`](config.default.toml) if you prefer to use
a configuration file.

At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine
the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware.
On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B
takes about 45 minutes.

After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to
save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works,
or any combination of those actions.


## Research features

In addition to its primary function of removing model censorship, Heretic also
provides features designed to support research into the semantics of model internals
(interpretability). To use those features, you need to install Heretic with the
optional `research` extra:

```
pip install -U heretic-llm[research]
```

This gives you access to the following functionality:

### Generate plots of residual vectors by passing `--plot-residuals`

When run with this flag, Heretic will:

1. Compute residual vectors (hidden states) for the first output token,
   for each transformer layer, for both &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; prompts.
2. Perform a [PaCMAP projection](https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP)
   from residual space to 2D-space.
3. Left-right align the projections of &quot;harmful&quot;/&quot;harmless&quot; residuals
   by their geometric medians to make projections for consecutive layers
   more similar. Additionally, PaCMAP is initialized with the previous
   layer&#039;s projections for each new layer, minimizing disruptive transitions.
4. Scatter-plot the projections, generating a PNG image for each layer.
5. Generate an animation showing how residuals transform between layers,
   as an animated GIF.

&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of residual vectors&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981aa6ed-5ab9-48f0-9abf-2b1a2c430295&quot; /&gt;

See [the configuration file](config.default.toml) for options that allow you
to control various aspects of the generated plots.

Note that PaCMAP is an expensive operation that is performed on the CPU.
For larger models, it can take an hour or more to compute projections
for all layers.

### Print details about residual geometry by passing `--print-residual-geometry`

If you are interested in a quantitative analysis of how residual vectors
for &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; prompts relate to each other, this flag gives you
the following table, packed with metrics that can facilitate understanding
the same (for [gemma-3-270m-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-270m-it)
in this case):

## How Heretic works

Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each
supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and
MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer
layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant &quot;refusal direction&quot;,
inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications
with that matrix.

Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between
the first-token residuals for &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; example prompts.

The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:

* `direction_index`: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special
  value `per layer`, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the
  refusal direction associated with that layer.
* `max_weight`, `max_weight_position`, `min_weight`, and `min_weight_distance`:
  For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the
  ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:

&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Explanation&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e4b84e-5a82-4faf-b918-ac642f9e4892&quot; /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Heretic&#039;s main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:

* The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with
  automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff.
  Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in
  [gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2).
* The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral
  values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated.
  This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified
  by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization
  process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.
* Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that
  MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions,
  so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.


## Prior art

I&#039;m aware of the following publicly available implementations of abliteration
techniques:

* [AutoAbliteration](https://huggingface.co/posts/mlabonne/714992455492422)
* [abliterator.py](https://github.com/FailSpy/abliterator)
* [wassname&#039;s Abliterator](https://github.com/wassname/abliterator)
* [ErisForge](https://github.com/Tsadoq/ErisForge)
* [Removing refusals with HF Transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers)
* [deccp](https://github.com/AUGMXNT/deccp)

Note that Heretic was written from scratch, and does not reuse code from
any of those projects.

&lt;/div&gt;

**MiniCPM-o** is the latest series of on-device multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) ungraded from MiniCPM-V. The models can now take image, video, text, and audio as inputs and provide high-quality text and speech outputs in an end-to-end fashion. The model series is designed for **strong performance and efficient deployment**. The most notable models in the series currently include:


- **MiniCPM-o 4.5**: 🔥🔥🔥 The latest and most capable model in the series. With a total of 9B parameters, this end-to-end model **approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash in vision, speech, and full-duplex multimodal live streaming**, making it one of the most versatile and performant models in the open-source community. The new full-duplex multimodal live streaming capability means that the output streams (speech and text), and the real-time input streams (video and audio) do not block each other. This **enables MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously** in a real-time omnimodal conversation, and perform **proactive interactions** such as proactive reminding. The improved voice mode supports bilingual real-time speech conversation in a more natural, expressive, and stable way, and also allows for voice cloning. It also advances MiniCPM-V&#039;s visual capabilities such as strong OCR capability, trustworthy behavior and multilingual support, etc. We also rollout a **high-performing llama.cpp-omni inference framework together with a WebRTC Demo**, to bring this full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience [available on local devices such as Macs](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/WebRTC_Demo/README.md).

- **MiniCPM-V 4.0**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ An efficient model in the MiniCPM-V series. With a total of 4B parameters, the model surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414 in image understanding on the OpenCompass evaluation. With its small parameter-size and efficient architecure, MiniCPM-V 4.0 is an ideal choice for on-device deployment on the phone.

## MiniCPM-o 4.5

**MiniCPM-o 4.5** is the latest and most capable model in the MiniCPM-o series. The model is built in an end-to-end fashion based on SigLip2, Whisper-medium, CosyVoice2, and Qwen3-8B with a total of 9B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement, and introduces new features for full-duplex multimodal live streaming. Notable features of MiniCPM-o 4.5 include:

- 🔥 **Leading Visual Capability.**
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 achieves an average score of 77.6 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. **With only 9B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash** for vision-language capabilities. It supports instruct and thinking modes in a single model, better covering efficiency and performance trade-offs in different user scenarios.

- 🎙 **Strong Speech Capability.** 
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 supports **bilingual real-time speech conversation with configurable voices** in English and Chinese. It features **more natural, expressive and stable speech conversation**. The model also allows for fun features such as **voice cloning and role play via a simple reference audio clip**, where the cloning performance surpasses strong TTS tools such as CosyVoice2.

- 🎬 **New Full-Duplex and Proactive Multimodal Live Streaming Capability.** 
  As a new feature, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process real-time, continuous video and audio input streams simultaneously while generating concurrent text and speech output streams in an end-to-end fashion, without mutual blocking. This **allows MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously**, creating a fluid, real-time omnimodal conversation experience. Beyond reactive responses, the model can also perform **proactive interaction**, such as initiating reminders or comments based on its continuous understanding of the live scene. 

- 💪 **Strong OCR Capability, Efficiency and Others.**
Advancing popular visual capabilities from MiniCPM-V series, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process **high-resolution images** (up to 1.8 million pixels) and **high-FPS videos** (up to 10fps) in any aspect ratio efficiently. It achieves **state-of-the-art peformance for end-to-end English document parsing** on OmniDocBench, outperforming proprietary models such as Gemini-3 Flash and GPT-5, and specialized tools such as DeepSeek-OCR 2. It also features **trustworthy behaviors**, matching Gemini 2.5 Flash on MMHal-Bench, and supports **multilingual capabilities** on more than 30 languages.

-  💫  **Easy Usage.**
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 can be easily used in various ways: (1) [llama.cpp](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/llama.cpp/minicpm-o4_5_llamacpp.md) and [Ollama](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/ollama/minicpm-o4_5_ollama.md) support for efficient CPU inference on local devices, (2) [int4](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/quantization/awq/minicpm-o4_5_awq_quantize.md) and [GGUF](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/quantization/gguf/minicpm-o4_5_gguf_quantize.md) format quantized models in 16 sizes, (3) [vLLM](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/vllm/minicpm-o4_5_vllm.md) and [SGLang](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/sglang/MiniCPM-o4_5_sglang.md) support for high-throughput and memory-efficient inference, (4) [FlagOS](#flagos) support for the unified multi-chip backend plugin, (5) fine-tuning on new domains and tasks with [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/finetune/llama-factory/finetune_llamafactory.md), and (6) online web demo on [server](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/gradio/README_o45.md). We also rollout a high-performing [llama.cpp-omni](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni) inference framework together with a [WebRTC Demo](https://minicpm-omni.openbmb.cn/), which **enables the full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience on local devices** such as [PCs](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni/blob/master/README.md) (e.g., on a MacBook).

**Model Architecture.**
- **End-to-end Omni-modal Architecture.** The modality encoders/decoders and LLM are densely connected via hidden states in an end-to-end fashion. This enables better information flow and control, and also facilitates full exploitation of rich multimodal knowledge during training.
- **Full-Duplex Omni-modal Live Streaming Mechanism.** (1) We turn the offline modality encoder/decoders into online and full-duplex ones for streaming inputs/outputs. The speech token decoder models text and speech tokens in an interleaved fashion to support full-duplex speech generation (i.e., sync timely with new input). This also facilitates more stable long speech generation (e.g., &gt; 1min).
(2) **We sync all the input and output streams on timeline in milliseconds**, which are jointly modeled by a time-division multiplexing (TDM) mechanism for omni-modality streaming processing in the LLM backbone. It divides parallel omni-modality streams into sequential info groups within small periodic time slices.
- **Proactive Interaction Mechanism.** The LLM continuously monitors the input video and audio streams, and decides at a frequency of 1Hz to speak or not. This high decision-making frequency together with full-duplex nature are curcial to enable the proactive interaction capability.
- **Configurable Speech Modeling Design.** We inherent the multimodal system prompt design of MiniCPM-o 2.6, which includes a traditional text system prompt, and a new audio system prompt to determine the assistant voice. This enables cloning new voices and role play in inference time for speech conversation.

## Inference

### Generating Your First Video

Here&#039;s a minimal example to generate a video using the default settings. Make sure VSA kernels are [installed](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/video_sparse_attention/installation/). Create a file called `example.py` with the following code:

```python
import os
from fastvideo import VideoGenerator

def main():
    os.environ[&quot;FASTVIDEO_ATTENTION_BACKEND&quot;] = &quot;VIDEO_SPARSE_ATTN&quot;

    # Create a video generator with a pre-trained model
    generator = VideoGenerator.from_pretrained(
        &quot;FastVideo/FastWan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers&quot;,
        num_gpus=1,  # Adjust based on your hardware
    )

    # Define a prompt for your video
    prompt = &quot;A curious raccoon peers through a vibrant field of yellow sunflowers, its eyes wide with interest.&quot;

    # Generate the video
    video = generator.generate_video(
        prompt,
        return_frames=True,  # Also return frames from this call (defaults to False)
        output_path=&quot;my_videos/&quot;,  # Controls where videos are saved
        save_video=True
    )

if __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:
    main()
```

Run the script with:

```bash
python example.py
```

# 🏆 The Best Machine Learning Engineering Agent!

[MLE-bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench) is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating the performance of AI agents on machine learning engineering tasks. Utilizing datasets from 75 Kaggle competitions, MLE-bench provides robust assessments of AI systems&#039; capabilities in real-world ML engineering scenarios.

R&amp;D-Agent currently leads as the top-performing machine learning engineering agent on MLE-bench:

| Agent | Low == Lite (%) | Medium (%) | High (%) | All (%) |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| R&amp;D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) | 51.52 ± 6.9 | 19.3 ± 5.5 | 26.67 ± 0 | 30.22 ± 1.5 |
| R&amp;D-Agent o1-preview | 48.18 ± 2.49 | 8.95 ± 2.36 | 18.67 ± 2.98 | 22.4 ± 1.1 |
| AIDE o1-preview | 34.3 ± 2.4 | 8.8 ± 1.1 | 10.0 ± 1.9 | 16.9 ± 1.1 |

**Notes:**
- **O3(R)+GPT-4.1(D)**: This version is designed to both reduce average time per loop and leverage a cost-effective combination of backend LLMs by seamlessly integrating Research Agent (o3) with Development Agent (GPT-4.1).
- **AIDE o1-preview**: Represents the previously best public result on MLE-bench as reported in the original MLE-bench paper.
- Average and standard deviation results for R&amp;D-Agent o1-preview is based on a independent of 5 seeds and for R&amp;D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) is based on 6 seeds.
- According to MLE-Bench, the 75 competitions are categorized into three levels of complexity: **Low==Lite** if we estimate that an experienced ML engineer can produce a sensible solution in under 2 hours, excluding the time taken to train any models; **Medium** if it takes between 2 and 10 hours; and **High** if it takes more than 10 hours.

You can inspect the detailed runs of the above results online.

# 🥇 The First Data-Centric Quant Multi-Agent Framework!

R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short **RD-Agent(Q)**, is the first data-centric, multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3198bc10-47ba-4ee0-8a8e-46d5ce44f45d)

Extensive experiments in real stock markets show that, at a cost under $10, RD-Agent(Q) achieves approximately 2× higher ARR than benchmark factor libraries while using over 70% fewer factors. It also surpasses state-of-the-art deep time-series models under smaller resource budgets. Its alternating factor–model optimization further delivers excellent trade-off between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness.

You can learn more details about **RD-Agent(Q)** through the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15155) and reproduce it through the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scens/quant_agent_fin.html).

# Data Science Agent Preview
Check out our demo video showcasing the current progress of our Data Science Agent under development:

# 🌟 Introduction
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/scen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our focused scenario&quot; style=&quot;width:80%; &quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

R&amp;D-Agent aims to automate the most critical and valuable aspects of the industrial R&amp;D process, and we begin with focusing on the data-driven scenarios to streamline the development of models and data. 
Methodologically, we have identified a framework with two key components: &#039;R&#039; for proposing new ideas and &#039;D&#039; for implementing them.
We believe that the automatic evolution of R&amp;D will lead to solutions of significant industrial value.


&lt;!-- Tag Cloud --&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


# ⚡ Quick start

### RD-Agent currently only supports Linux.

You can try above demos by running the following command:

### 🐳 Docker installation.
Users must ensure Docker is installed before attempting most scenarios. Please refer to the [official 🐳Docker page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation instructions.
Ensure the current user can run Docker commands **without using sudo**. You can verify this by executing `docker run hello-world`.

### 🐍 Create a Conda Environment
- Create a new conda environment with Python (3.10 and 3.11 are well-tested in our CI):
  ```sh
  conda create -n rdagent python=3.10
  ```
- Activate the environment:
  ```sh
  conda activate rdagent
  ```

### 🛠️ Install the R&amp;D-Agent

#### For Users
- You can directly install the R&amp;D-Agent package from PyPI:
  ```sh
  pip install rdagent
  ```

#### For Developers
- If you want to try the latest version or contribute to RD-Agent, you can install it from the source and follow the development setup:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent
  cd RD-Agent
  make dev
  ```

More details can be found in the [development setup](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html).

### 💊 Health check
- rdagent provides a health check that currently checks two things.
  - whether the docker installation was successful.
  - whether the default port used by the [rdagent ui](https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-monitor-the-application-results) is occupied.
  ```sh
  rdagent health_check --no-check-env
  ```


### ⚙️ Configuration
- The demos requires following ability:
  - ChatCompletion
  - json_mode
  - embedding query

  You can set your Chat Model and Embedding Model in the following ways:

  &gt; **🔥 Attention**: We now provide experimental support for **DeepSeek** models! You can use DeepSeek&#039;s official API for cost-effective and high-performance inference. See the configuration example below for DeepSeek setup.

- **Using LiteLLM (Default)**: We now support LiteLLM as a backend for integration with multiple LLM providers. You can configure in multiple ways:

  **Option 1: Unified API base for both models**

  *Configuration Example: `OpenAI` Setup :*

  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  # Set to any model supported by LiteLLM.
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o 
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  # Configure unified API base
  OPENAI_API_BASE=&lt;your_unified_api_base&gt;
  OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_openai_api_key&gt;
  ```

  *Configuration Example: `Azure OpenAI` Setup :*

  &gt; Before using this configuration, please confirm in advance that your `Azure OpenAI API key` supports `embedded models`.

  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=azure/&lt;Model deployment supporting embedding&gt;
  CHAT_MODEL=azure/&lt;your deployment name&gt;
  AZURE_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_openai_api_key&gt;
  AZURE_API_BASE=&lt;your_unified_api_base&gt;
  AZURE_API_VERSION=&lt;azure api version&gt;
  ```

  **Option 2: Separate API bases for Chat and Embedding models**
  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  # Set to any model supported by LiteLLM.
  # Configure separate API bases for chat and embedding
  
  # CHAT MODEL:
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o 
  OPENAI_API_BASE=&lt;your_chat_api_base&gt;
  OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_openai_api_key&gt;

  # EMBEDDING MODEL:
  # TAKE siliconflow as an example, you can use other providers.
  # Note: embedding requires litellm_proxy prefix
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=litellm_proxy/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
  LITELLM_PROXY_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_siliconflow_api_key&gt;
  LITELLM_PROXY_API_BASE=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
  ```

  *Configuration Example: `DeepSeek` Setup :*

  &gt;Since many users encounter configuration errors when setting up DeepSeek. Here&#039;s a complete working example for DeepSeek Setup:
  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  # CHAT MODEL: Using DeepSeek Official API
  CHAT_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat 
  DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_deepseek_api_key&gt;

  # EMBEDDING MODEL: Using SiliconFlow for embedding since deepseek has no embedding model.
  # Note: embedding requires litellm_proxy prefix
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=litellm_proxy/BAAI/bge-m3
  LITELLM_PROXY_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_siliconflow_api_key&gt;
  LITELLM_PROXY_API_BASE=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
  ```

  Notice: If you are using reasoning models that include thought processes in their responses (such as \&lt;think&gt; tags), you need to set the following environment variable:
  ```bash
  REASONING_THINK_RM=True
  ```

  You can also use a deprecated backend if you only use `OpenAI API` or `Azure OpenAI` directly. For this deprecated setting and more configuration information, please refer to the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_and_configuration.html). 



- If your environment configuration is complete, please execute the following commands to check if your configuration is valid. This step is necessary.

  ```bash
  rdagent health_check
  ```

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide &lt;a name=&quot;quickstart&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Choose between our hosted platform or self-hosted package:

### Hosted Platform

Get up and running in minutes with automatic updates, analytics, and enterprise security.

1. Sign up on [Mem0 Platform](https://app.mem0.ai)
2. Embed the memory layer via SDK or API keys

### Self-Hosted (Open Source)

Install the sdk via pip:

```bash
pip install mem0ai
```

Install sdk via npm:
```bash
npm install mem0ai
```

### Basic Usage

Mem0 requires an LLM to function, with `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14 from OpenAI as the default. However, it supports a variety of LLMs; for details, refer to our [Supported LLMs documentation](https://docs.mem0.ai/components/llms/overview).

First step is to instantiate the memory:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from mem0 import Memory

openai_client = OpenAI()
memory = Memory()

def chat_with_memories(message: str, user_id: str = &quot;default_user&quot;) -&gt; str:
    # Retrieve relevant memories
    relevant_memories = memory.search(query=message, user_id=user_id, limit=3)
    memories_str = &quot;\n&quot;.join(f&quot;- {entry[&#039;memory&#039;]}&quot; for entry in relevant_memories[&quot;results&quot;])

    # Generate Assistant response
    system_prompt = f&quot;You are a helpful AI. Answer the question based on query and memories.\nUser Memories:\n{memories_str}&quot;
    messages = [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: system_prompt}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: message}]
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model=&quot;gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14&quot;, messages=messages)
    assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Create new memories from the conversation
    messages.append({&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: assistant_response})
    memory.add(messages, user_id=user_id)

    return assistant_response

def main():
    print(&quot;Chat with AI (type &#039;exit&#039; to quit)&quot;)
    while True:
        user_input = input(&quot;You: &quot;).strip()
        if user_input.lower() == &#039;exit&#039;:
            print(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;)
            break
        print(f&quot;AI: {chat_with_memories(user_input)}&quot;)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
```

For detailed integration steps, see the [Quickstart](https://docs.mem0.ai/quickstart) and [API Reference](https://docs.mem0.ai/api-reference).

# Skills
Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that&#039;s creating documents with your company&#039;s brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization&#039;s specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

# About This Repository

This repository contains skills that demonstrate what&#039;s possible with Claude&#039;s skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We&#039;ve also included the document creation &amp; editing skills that power [Claude&#039;s document capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) under the hood in the [`skills/docx`](./skills/docx), [`skills/pdf`](./skills/pdf), [`skills/pptx`](./skills/pptx), and [`skills/xlsx`](./skills/xlsx) subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application.

## Disclaimer

**These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only.** While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.

# Try in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API

## Claude Code
You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
```

Then, to install a specific set of skills:
1. Select `Browse and install plugins`
2. Select `anthropic-agent-skills`
3. Select `document-skills` or `example-skills`
4. Select `Install now`

Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via:
```
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the `document-skills` plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: &quot;Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from `path/to/some-file.pdf`&quot;

# Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow. For more details, see [How to create custom skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).

# Partner Skills

Skills are a great way to teach Claude how to get better at using specific pieces of software. As we see awesome example skills from partners, we may highlight some of them here:

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Claude Agent SDK for Python

Python SDK for Claude Agent. See the [Claude Agent SDK documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python) for more information.

## Installation

```bash
pip install claude-agent-sdk
```

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.10+

**Note:** The Claude Code CLI is automatically bundled with the package - no separate installation required! The SDK will use the bundled CLI by default. If you prefer to use a system-wide installation or a specific version, you can:

- Install Claude Code separately: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
- Specify a custom path: `ClaudeAgentOptions(cli_path=&quot;/path/to/claude&quot;)`

## Quick Start

```python
import anyio
from claude_agent_sdk import query

async def main():
    async for message in query(prompt=&quot;What is 2 + 2?&quot;):
        print(message)

anyio.run(main)
```

## Basic Usage: query()

`query()` is an async function for querying Claude Code. It returns an `AsyncIterator` of response messages. See [src/claude_agent_sdk/query.py](src/claude_agent_sdk/query.py).

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AssistantMessage, TextBlock

# Simple query
async for message in query(prompt=&quot;Hello Claude&quot;):
    if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
        for block in message.content:
            if isinstance(block, TextBlock):
                print(block.text)

# With options
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt=&quot;You are a helpful assistant&quot;,
    max_turns=1
)

async for message in query(prompt=&quot;Tell me a joke&quot;, options=options):
    print(message)
```

### Using Tools

```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=[&quot;Read&quot;, &quot;Write&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;],
    permission_mode=&#039;acceptEdits&#039;  # auto-accept file edits
)

async for message in query(
    prompt=&quot;Create a hello.py file&quot;,
    options=options
):
    # Process tool use and results
    pass
```

### Working Directory

```python
from pathlib import Path

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    cwd=&quot;/path/to/project&quot;  # or Path(&quot;/path/to/project&quot;)
)
```

## ClaudeSDKClient

`ClaudeSDKClient` supports bidirectional, interactive conversations with Claude
Code. See [src/claude_agent_sdk/client.py](src/claude_agent_sdk/client.py).

Unlike `query()`, `ClaudeSDKClient` additionally enables **custom tools** and **hooks**, both of which can be defined as Python functions.

### Custom Tools (as In-Process SDK MCP Servers)

A **custom tool** is a Python function that you can offer to Claude, for Claude to invoke as needed.

Custom tools are implemented in-process MCP servers that run directly within your Python application, eliminating the need for separate processes that regular MCP servers require.

For an end-to-end example, see [MCP Calculator](examples/mcp_calculator.py).

#### Creating a Simple Tool

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import tool, create_sdk_mcp_server, ClaudeAgentOptions, ClaudeSDKClient

# Define a tool using the @tool decorator
@tool(&quot;greet&quot;, &quot;Greet a user&quot;, {&quot;name&quot;: str})
async def greet_user(args):
    return {
        &quot;content&quot;: [
            {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: f&quot;Hello, {args[&#039;name&#039;]}!&quot;}
        ]
    }

# Create an SDK MCP server
server = create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name=&quot;my-tools&quot;,
    version=&quot;1.0.0&quot;,
    tools=[greet_user]
)

# Use it with Claude
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={&quot;tools&quot;: server},
    allowed_tools=[&quot;mcp__tools__greet&quot;]
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    await client.query(&quot;Greet Alice&quot;)

    # Extract and print response
    async for msg in client.receive_response():
        print(msg)
```

#### Benefits Over External MCP Servers

- **No subprocess management** - Runs in the same process as your application
- **Better performance** - No IPC overhead for tool calls
- **Simpler deployment** - Single Python process instead of multiple
- **Easier debugging** - All code runs in the same process
- **Type safety** - Direct Python function calls with type hints

#### Migration from External Servers

```python
# BEFORE: External MCP server (separate process)
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={
        &quot;calculator&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;python&quot;,
            &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;-m&quot;, &quot;calculator_server&quot;]
        }
    }
)

# AFTER: SDK MCP server (in-process)
from my_tools import add, subtract  # Your tool functions

calculator = create_sdk_mcp_server(
    name=&quot;calculator&quot;,
    tools=[add, subtract]
)

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={&quot;calculator&quot;: calculator}
)
```

#### Mixed Server Support

You can use both SDK and external MCP servers together:

```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={
        &quot;internal&quot;: sdk_server,      # In-process SDK server
        &quot;external&quot;: {                # External subprocess server
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;external-server&quot;
        }
    }
)
```

### Hooks

A **hook** is a Python function that the Claude Code _application_ (_not_ Claude) invokes at specific points of the Claude agent loop. Hooks can provide deterministic processing and automated feedback for Claude. Read more in [Claude Code Hooks Reference](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).

For more examples, see examples/hooks.py.

#### Example

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, ClaudeSDKClient, HookMatcher

async def check_bash_command(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    tool_name = input_data[&quot;tool_name&quot;]
    tool_input = input_data[&quot;tool_input&quot;]
    if tool_name != &quot;Bash&quot;:
        return {}
    command = tool_input.get(&quot;command&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
    block_patterns = [&quot;foo.sh&quot;]
    for pattern in block_patterns:
        if pattern in command:
            return {
                &quot;hookSpecificOutput&quot;: {
                    &quot;hookEventName&quot;: &quot;PreToolUse&quot;,
                    &quot;permissionDecision&quot;: &quot;deny&quot;,
                    &quot;permissionDecisionReason&quot;: f&quot;Command contains invalid pattern: {pattern}&quot;,
                }
            }
    return {}

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=[&quot;Bash&quot;],
    hooks={
        &quot;PreToolUse&quot;: [
            HookMatcher(matcher=&quot;Bash&quot;, hooks=[check_bash_command]),
        ],
    }
)

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    # Test 1: Command with forbidden pattern (will be blocked)
    await client.query(&quot;Run the bash command: ./foo.sh --help&quot;)
    async for msg in client.receive_response():
        print(msg)

    print(&quot;\n&quot; + &quot;=&quot; * 50 + &quot;\n&quot;)

    # Test 2: Safe command that should work
    await client.query(&quot;Run the bash command: echo &#039;Hello from hooks example!&#039;&quot;)
    async for msg in client.receive_response():
        print(msg)
```

## Types

See [src/claude_agent_sdk/types.py](src/claude_agent_sdk/types.py) for complete type definitions:

- `ClaudeAgentOptions` - Configuration options
- `AssistantMessage`, `UserMessage`, `SystemMessage`, `ResultMessage` - Message types
- `TextBlock`, `ToolUseBlock`, `ToolResultBlock` - Content blocks

## Error Handling

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import (
    ClaudeSDKError,      # Base error
    CLINotFoundError,    # Claude Code not installed
    CLIConnectionError,  # Connection issues
    ProcessError,        # Process failed
    CLIJSONDecodeError,  # JSON parsing issues
)

try:
    async for message in query(prompt=&quot;Hello&quot;):
        pass
except CLINotFoundError:
    print(&quot;Please install Claude Code&quot;)
except ProcessError as e:
    print(f&quot;Process failed with exit code: {e.exit_code}&quot;)
except CLIJSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f&quot;Failed to parse response: {e}&quot;)
```

See [src/claude_agent_sdk/\_errors.py](src/claude_agent_sdk/_errors.py) for all error types.

## Available Tools

See the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#tools-available-to-claude) for a complete list of available tools.

## Examples

See [examples/quick_start.py](examples/quick_start.py) for a complete working example.

See [examples/streaming_mode.py](examples/streaming_mode.py) for comprehensive examples involving `ClaudeSDKClient`. You can even run interactive examples in IPython from [examples/streaming_mode_ipython.py](examples/streaming_mode_ipython.py).

## Migrating from Claude Code SDK

If you&#039;re upgrading from the Claude Code SDK (versions &lt; 0.1.0), please see the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#010) for details on breaking changes and new features, including:

- `ClaudeCodeOptions` → `ClaudeAgentOptions` rename
- Merged system prompt configuration
- Settings isolation and explicit control
- New programmatic subagents and session forking features

## Development

If you&#039;re contributing to this project, run the initial setup script to install git hooks:

```bash
./scripts/initial-setup.sh
```

This installs a pre-push hook that runs lint checks before pushing, matching the CI workflow. To skip the hook temporarily, use `git push --no-verify`.

### Building Wheels Locally

To build wheels with the bundled Claude Code CLI:

```bash
# Install build dependencies
pip install build twine

# Build wheel with bundled CLI
python scripts/build_wheel.py

# Build with specific version
python scripts/build_wheel.py --version 0.1.4

# Build with specific CLI version
python scripts/build_wheel.py --cli-version 2.0.0

# Clean bundled CLI after building
python scripts/build_wheel.py --clean

# Skip CLI download (use existing)
python scripts/build_wheel.py --skip-download
```

The build script:

1. Downloads Claude Code CLI for your platform
2. Bundles it in the wheel
3. Builds both wheel and source distribution
4. Checks the package with twine

See `python scripts/build_wheel.py --help` for all options.

### Release Workflow

The package is published to PyPI via the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. To create a new release:

1. **Trigger the workflow** manually from the Actions tab with two inputs:
   - `version`: The package version to publish (e.g., `0.1.5`)
   - `claude_code_version`: The Claude Code CLI version to bundle (e.g., `2.0.0` or `latest`)

2. **The workflow will**:
   - Build platform-specific wheels for macOS, Linux, and Windows
   - Bundle the specified Claude Code CLI version in each wheel
   - Build a source distribution
   - Publish all artifacts to PyPI
   - Create a release branch with version updates
   - Open a PR to main with:
     - Updated `pyproject.toml` version
     - Updated `src/claude_agent_sdk/_version.py`
     - Updated `src/claude_agent_sdk/_cli_version.py` with bundled CLI version
     - Auto-generated `CHANGELOG.md` entry

3. **Review and merge** the release PR to update main with the new version information

The workflow tracks both the package version and the bundled CLI version separately, allowing you to release a new package version with an updated CLI without code changes.

## License and terms

Use of this SDK is governed by Anthropic&#039;s [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms), including when you use it to power products and services that you make available to your own customers and end users, except to the extent a specific component or dependency is covered by a different license as indicated in that component&#039;s LICENSE file.

- Replaces traditional RAG systems with a unified memory layer built on graphs and vectors
- Reduces developer effort and infrastructure cost while improving quality and precision
- Provides Pythonic data pipelines for ingestion from 30+ data sources
- Offers high customizability through user-defined tasks, modular pipelines, and built-in search endpoints


## Basic Usage &amp; Feature Guide

To learn more, [check out this short, end-to-end Colab walkthrough](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Vi9zID-M3fpKpKiaqDBvkk98ElkRPWy?usp=sharing) of Cognee&#039;s core features.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Vi9zID-M3fpKpKiaqDBvkk98ElkRPWy?usp=sharing)

## Quickstart

Let’s try Cognee in just a few lines of code. For detailed setup and configuration, see the [Cognee Docs](https://docs.cognee.ai/getting-started/installation#environment-configuration).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 to 3.13

### Step 1: Install Cognee

You can install Cognee with **pip**, **poetry**, **uv**, or your preferred Python package manager.

```bash
uv pip install cognee
```

### Step 2: Configure the LLM
```python
import os
os.environ[&quot;LLM_API_KEY&quot;] = &quot;YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;
```
Alternatively, create a `.env` file using our [template](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee/blob/main/.env.template).

To integrate other LLM providers, see our [LLM Provider Documentation](https://docs.cognee.ai/setup-configuration/llm-providers).

### Step 3: Run the Pipeline

Cognee will take your documents, generate a knowledge graph from them and then query the graph based on combined relationships.

Now, run a minimal pipeline:

```python
import cognee
import asyncio
from pprint import pprint


async def main():
    # Add text to cognee
    await cognee.add(&quot;Cognee turns documents into AI memory.&quot;)

    # Generate the knowledge graph
    await cognee.cognify()

    # Add memory algorithms to the graph
    await cognee.memify()

    # Query the knowledge graph
    results = await cognee.search(&quot;What does Cognee do?&quot;)

    # Display the results
    for result in results:
        pprint(result)


if __name__ == &#039;__main__&#039;:
    asyncio.run(main())

```

As you can see, the output is generated from the document we previously stored in Cognee:

```bash
  Cognee turns documents into AI memory.
```

### Use the Cognee CLI

As an alternative, you can get started with these essential commands:

```bash
cognee-cli add &quot;Cognee turns documents into AI memory.&quot;

cognee-cli cognify

cognee-cli search &quot;What does Cognee do?&quot;
cognee-cli delete --all

```

To open the local UI, run:
```bash
cognee-cli -ui
```
