## Introduction

LangExtract is a Python library that uses LLMs to extract structured information from unstructured text documents based on user-defined instructions. It processes materials such as clinical notes or reports, identifying and organizing key details while ensuring the extracted data corresponds to the source text.

## Why LangExtract?

1.  **Precise Source Grounding:** Maps every extraction to its exact location in the source text, enabling visual highlighting for easy traceability and verification.
2.  **Reliable Structured Outputs:** Enforces a consistent output schema based on your few-shot examples, leveraging controlled generation in supported models like Gemini to guarantee robust, structured results.
3.  **Optimized for Long Documents:** Overcomes the &quot;needle-in-a-haystack&quot; challenge of large document extraction by using an optimized strategy of text chunking, parallel processing, and multiple passes for higher recall.
4.  **Interactive Visualization:** Instantly generates a self-contained, interactive HTML file to visualize and review thousands of extracted entities in their original context.
5.  **Flexible LLM Support:** Supports your preferred models, from cloud-based LLMs like the Google Gemini family to local open-source models via the built-in Ollama interface.
6.  **Adaptable to Any Domain:** Define extraction tasks for any domain using just a few examples. LangExtract adapts to your needs without requiring any model fine-tuning.
7.  **Leverages LLM World Knowledge:** Utilize precise prompt wording and few-shot examples to influence how the extraction task may utilize LLM knowledge. The accuracy of any inferred information and its adherence to the task specification are contingent upon the selected LLM, the complexity of the task, the clarity of the prompt instructions, and the nature of the prompt examples.

## Quick Start

&gt; **Note:** Using cloud-hosted models like Gemini requires an API key. See the [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup-for-cloud-models) section for instructions on how to get and configure your key.

Extract structured information with just a few lines of code.

### 1. Define Your Extraction Task

First, create a prompt that clearly describes what you want to extract. Then, provide a high-quality example to guide the model.

```python
import langextract as lx
import textwrap

# 1. Define the prompt and extraction rules
prompt = textwrap.dedent(&quot;&quot;&quot;\
    Extract characters, emotions, and relationships in order of appearance.
    Use exact text for extractions. Do not paraphrase or overlap entities.
    Provide meaningful attributes for each entity to add context.&quot;&quot;&quot;)

# 2. Provide a high-quality example to guide the model
examples = [
    lx.data.ExampleData(
        text=&quot;ROMEO. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.&quot;,
        extractions=[
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class=&quot;character&quot;,
                extraction_text=&quot;ROMEO&quot;,
                attributes={&quot;emotional_state&quot;: &quot;wonder&quot;}
            ),
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class=&quot;emotion&quot;,
                extraction_text=&quot;But soft!&quot;,
                attributes={&quot;feeling&quot;: &quot;gentle awe&quot;}
            ),
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class=&quot;relationship&quot;,
                extraction_text=&quot;Juliet is the sun&quot;,
                attributes={&quot;type&quot;: &quot;metaphor&quot;}
            ),
        ]
    )
]
```

&gt; **Note:** Examples drive model behavior. Each `extraction_text` should ideally be verbatim from the example&#039;s `text` (no paraphrasing), listed in order of appearance. LangExtract raises `Prompt alignment` warnings by default if examples don&#039;t follow this pattern—resolve these for best results.

### 2. Run the Extraction

Provide your input text and the prompt materials to the `lx.extract` function.

```python
# The input text to be processed
input_text = &quot;Lady Juliet gazed longingly at the stars, her heart aching for Romeo&quot;

# Run the extraction
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
)
```

&gt; **Model Selection**: `gemini-2.5-flash` is the recommended default, offering an excellent balance of speed, cost, and quality. For highly complex tasks requiring deeper reasoning, `gemini-2.5-pro` may provide superior results. For large-scale or production use, a Tier 2 Gemini quota is suggested to increase throughput and avoid rate limits. See the [rate-limit documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-2) for details.
&gt;
&gt; **Model Lifecycle**: Note that Gemini models have a lifecycle with defined retirement dates. Users should consult the [official model version documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions) to stay informed about the latest stable and legacy versions.

### 3. Visualize the Results

The extractions can be saved to a `.jsonl` file, a popular format for working with language model data. LangExtract can then generate an interactive HTML visualization from this file to review the entities in context.

```python
# Save the results to a JSONL file
lx.io.save_annotated_documents([result], output_name=&quot;extraction_results.jsonl&quot;, output_dir=&quot;.&quot;)

# Generate the visualization from the file
html_content = lx.visualize(&quot;extraction_results.jsonl&quot;)
with open(&quot;visualization.html&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as f:
    if hasattr(html_content, &#039;data&#039;):
        f.write(html_content.data)  # For Jupyter/Colab
    else:
        f.write(html_content)
```

This creates an animated and interactive HTML file:

![Romeo and Juliet Basic Visualization ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/docs/_static/romeo_juliet_basic.gif)

&gt; **Note on LLM Knowledge Utilization:** This example demonstrates extractions that stay close to the text evidence - extracting &quot;longing&quot; for Lady Juliet&#039;s emotional state and identifying &quot;yearning&quot; from &quot;gazed longingly at the stars.&quot; The task could be modified to generate attributes that draw more heavily from the LLM&#039;s world knowledge (e.g., adding `&quot;identity&quot;: &quot;Capulet family daughter&quot;` or `&quot;literary_context&quot;: &quot;tragic heroine&quot;`). The balance between text-evidence and knowledge-inference is controlled by your prompt instructions and example attributes.

### Scaling to Longer Documents

For larger texts, you can process entire documents directly from URLs with parallel processing and enhanced sensitivity:

```python
# Process Romeo &amp; Juliet directly from Project Gutenberg
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1513/1513-0.txt&quot;,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    extraction_passes=3,    # Improves recall through multiple passes
    max_workers=20,         # Parallel processing for speed
    max_char_buffer=1000    # Smaller contexts for better accuracy
)
```

This approach can extract hundreds of entities from full novels while maintaining high accuracy. The interactive visualization seamlessly handles large result sets, making it easy to explore hundreds of entities from the output JSONL file. **[See the full *Romeo and Juliet* extraction example →](https://github.com/google/langextract/blob/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md)** for detailed results and performance insights.

### Vertex AI Batch Processing

Save costs on large-scale tasks by enabling Vertex AI Batch API: `language_model_params={&quot;vertexai&quot;: True, &quot;batch&quot;: {&quot;enabled&quot;: True}}`.

See an example of the Vertex AI Batch API usage in [this example](docs/examples/batch_api_example.md).

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install langextract
```

*Recommended for most users. For isolated environments, consider using a virtual environment:*

```bash
python -m venv langextract_env
source langextract_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: langextract_env\Scripts\activate
pip install langextract
```

### From Source

LangExtract uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml` for dependency management:

*Installing with `-e` puts the package in development mode, allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.*


```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/langextract.git
cd langextract

# For basic installation:
pip install -e .

# For development (includes linting tools):
pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;

# For testing (includes pytest):
pip install -e &quot;.[test]&quot;
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t langextract .
docker run --rm -e LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot; langextract python your_script.py
```

## API Key Setup for Cloud Models

When using LangExtract with cloud-hosted models (like Gemini or OpenAI), you&#039;ll need to
set up an API key. On-device models don&#039;t require an API key. For developers
using local LLMs, LangExtract offers built-in support for Ollama and can be
extended to other third-party APIs by updating the inference endpoints.

### API Key Sources

Get API keys from:

*   [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for Gemini models
*   [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdks/overview) for enterprise use
*   [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for OpenAI models

### Setting up API key in your environment

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```bash
export LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;
```

**Option 2: .env File (Recommended)**

Add your API key to a `.env` file:

```bash
# Add API key to .env file
cat &gt;&gt; .env &lt;&lt; &#039;EOF&#039;
LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
EOF

# Keep your API key secure
echo &#039;.env&#039; &gt;&gt; .gitignore
```

In your Python code:
```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=&quot;Extract information...&quot;,
    examples=[...],
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;
)
```

**Option 3: Direct API Key (Not Recommended for Production)**

You can also provide the API key directly in your code, though this is not recommended for production use:

```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=&quot;Extract information...&quot;,
    examples=[...],
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    api_key=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;  # Only use this for testing/development
)
```

**Option 4: Vertex AI (Service Accounts)**

Use [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) for authentication with service accounts:

```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=&quot;Extract information...&quot;,
    examples=[...],
    model_id=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash&quot;,
    language_model_params={
        &quot;vertexai&quot;: True,
        &quot;project&quot;: &quot;your-project-id&quot;,
        &quot;location&quot;: &quot;global&quot;  # or regional endpoint
    }
)
```

## Adding Custom Model Providers

LangExtract supports custom LLM providers via a lightweight plugin system. You can add support for new models without changing core code.

- Add new model support independently of the core library
- Distribute your provider as a separate Python package
- Keep custom dependencies isolated
- Override or extend built-in providers via priority-based resolution

See the detailed guide in [Provider System Documentation](langextract/providers/README.md) to learn how to:

- Register a provider with `@registry.register(...)`
- Publish an entry point for discovery
- Optionally provide a schema with `get_schema_class()` for structured output
- Integrate with the factory via `create_model(...)`

## Using OpenAI Models

LangExtract supports OpenAI models (requires optional dependency: `pip install langextract[openai]`):

```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,  # Automatically selects OpenAI provider
    api_key=os.environ.get(&#039;OPENAI_API_KEY&#039;),
    fence_output=True,
    use_schema_constraints=False
)
```

Note: OpenAI models require `fence_output=True` and `use_schema_constraints=False` because LangExtract doesn&#039;t implement schema constraints for OpenAI yet.

## Using Local LLMs with Ollama
LangExtract supports local inference using Ollama, allowing you to run models without API keys:

```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id=&quot;gemma2:2b&quot;,  # Automatically selects Ollama provider
    model_url=&quot;http://localhost:11434&quot;,
    fence_output=False,
    use_schema_constraints=False
)
```

**Quick setup:** Install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/), run `ollama pull gemma2:2b`, then `ollama serve`.

For detailed installation, Docker setup, and examples, see [`examples/ollama/`](examples/ollama/).

## More Examples

Additional examples of LangExtract in action:

### *Romeo and Juliet* Full Text Extraction

LangExtract can process complete documents directly from URLs. This example demonstrates extraction from the full text of *Romeo and Juliet* from Project Gutenberg (147,843 characters), showing parallel processing, sequential extraction passes, and performance optimization for long document processing.

**[View *Romeo and Juliet* Full Text Example →](https://github.com/google/langextract/blob/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md)**

### Medication Extraction

&gt; **Disclaimer:** This demonstration is for illustrative purposes of LangExtract&#039;s baseline capability only. It does not represent a finished or approved product, is not intended to diagnose or suggest treatment of any disease or condition, and should not be used for medical advice.

LangExtract excels at extracting structured medical information from clinical text. These examples demonstrate both basic entity recognition (medication names, dosages, routes) and relationship extraction (connecting medications to their attributes), showing LangExtract&#039;s effectiveness for healthcare applications.

## Quick Start

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jeffallan/claude-skills
```
then
```bash
/plugin install fullstack-dev-skills@jeffallan
```

For all installation methods and first steps, see the [**Quick Start Guide**](QUICKSTART.md).

**Full documentation:** [jeffallan.github.io/claude-skills](https://jeffallan.github.io/claude-skills)

## Skills

&lt;!-- SKILL_COUNT --&gt;66&lt;!-- /SKILL_COUNT --&gt; specialized skills across 12 categories covering languages, backend/frontend frameworks, infrastructure, APIs, testing, DevOps, security, data/ML, and platform specialists.

See [**Skills Guide**](SKILLS_GUIDE.md) for the full list, decision trees, and workflow combinations.

## Usage Patterns

### Context-Aware Activation

Skills activate automatically based on your request:

```bash
# Backend Development
&quot;Implement JWT authentication in my NestJS API&quot;
→ Activates: NestJS Expert → Loads: references/authentication.md

# Frontend Development
&quot;Build a React component with Server Components&quot;
→ Activates: React Expert → Loads: references/server-components.md
```

### Multi-Skill Workflows

Complex tasks combine multiple skills:

```
Feature Development: Feature Forge → Architecture Designer → Fullstack Guardian → Test Master → DevOps Engineer
Bug Investigation:   Debugging Wizard → Framework Expert → Test Master → Code Reviewer
Security Hardening:  Secure Code Guardian → Security Reviewer → Test Master
```

## Context Engineering

Surface and validate Claude&#039;s hidden assumptions about your project with `/common-ground`. See the [**Common Ground Guide**](docs/COMMON_GROUND.md) for full documentation.

## Project Workflow

&lt;!-- WORKFLOW_COUNT --&gt;9&lt;!-- /WORKFLOW_COUNT --&gt; workflow commands manage epics from discovery through retrospectives, integrating with Jira and Confluence. See &lt;a href=&quot;docs/WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.md&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow Commands Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the full command reference and lifecycle diagrams.
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; **Setup:** Workflow commands require an Atlassian MCP server. See the [**Atlassian MCP Setup Guide**](docs/ATLASSIAN_MCP_SETUP.md).

**Before to post an install or bug issue search carefully to the opened and closed issues TAB&lt;br&gt;
to be sure your issue does not exist already.**

&gt;[!NOTE]
**EPUB format lacks any standard structure like what is a chapter, paragraph, preface etc.&lt;br&gt;
So you should first remove manually any text you don&#039;t want to be converted in audio.**

### Basic  Usage
   - **Linux/MacOS**:
     ```bash
     ./ebook2audiobook.command --headless --ebook &lt;path_to_ebook_file&gt; --voice [path_to_voice_file] --language [language_code]
     ```
   - **Windows**
     ```bash
     ebook2audiobook.cmd --headless --ebook &lt;path_to_ebook_file&gt; --voice [path_to_voice_file] --language [language_code]
     ```
     
  - **[--ebook]**: Path to your eBook file
  - **[--voice]**: Voice cloning file path (optional)
  - **[--language]**: Language code in ISO-639-3 (i.e.: ita for italian, eng for english, deu for german...).&lt;br&gt;
    Default language is eng and --language is optional for default language set in ./lib/lang.py.&lt;br&gt;
    The ISO-639-1 2 letters codes are also supported.


###  Example of Custom Model Zip Upload
  (must be a .zip file containing the mandatory model files. Example for XTTSv2: config.json, model.pth, vocab.json and ref.wav)
   - **Linux/MacOS**
     ```bash

     ebook2audiobook.cmd --headless --ebook &lt;ebook_file_path&gt; --language &lt;language&gt; --custom_model &lt;custom_model_path&gt;
     ```
     &lt;i&gt;Note: the ref.wav of your custom model is always the voice selected for the conversion&lt;/i&gt;
     
- **&lt;custom_model_path&gt;**: Path to `model_name.zip` file,
      which must contain (according to the tts engine) all the mandatory files&lt;br&gt;
      (see ./lib/models.py).

UI-TARS-1.5, an open-source multimodal agent built upon a powerful vision-language model. It is capable of effectively performing diverse tasks within virtual worlds.

Leveraging the foundational architecture introduced in [our recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12326), UI-TARS-1.5 integrates advanced reasoning enabled by reinforcement learning. This allows the model to reason through its thoughts before taking action, significantly enhancing its performance and adaptability, particularly in inference-time scaling. Our new 1.5 version achieves state-of-the-art results across a variety of standard benchmarks, demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities and notable improvements over prior models.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide: Deploying and Using Our Model

To help you get started quickly with our model, we recommend following the steps below in order. These steps will guide you through deployment, prediction post-processing to make the model take actions in your environment.


### ✅ Step 1: Deployment &amp; Inference

👉 &lt;a href=&quot;README_deploy.md&quot;&gt;Deployment and Inference&lt;/a&gt;.
This includes instructions for model deployment using huggingface endpoint, and running your first prediction.


### ✅ Step 2: Post Processing

#### Installation
```bash
pip install ui-tars
# or
uv pip install ui-tars
```
#### Usage
```python
from ui_tars.action_parser import parse_action_to_structure_output, parsing_response_to_pyautogui_code

response = &quot;Thought: Click the button\nAction: click(start_box=&#039;(100,200)&#039;)&quot;
original_image_width, original_image_height = 1920, 1080
parsed_dict = parse_action_to_structure_output(
    response,
    factor=1000,
    origin_resized_height=original_image_height,
    origin_resized_width=original_image_width,
    model_type=&quot;qwen25vl&quot;
)
print(parsed_dict)
parsed_pyautogui_code = parsing_response_to_pyautogui_code(
    responses=parsed_dict,
    image_height=original_image_height,
    image_width=original_image_width
)
print(parsed_pyautogui_code)
```
##### FYI: Coordinates visualization
To help you better understand the coordinate processing, we also provide a &lt;a href=&quot;README_coordinates.md&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; for coordinates processing visualization.

## Prompt Usage Guide

To accommodate different device environments and task complexities, the following three prompt templates in &lt;a href=&quot;codes/ui_tars/prompt.py&quot;&gt;codes/ui_tars/prompt.py&lt;/a&gt;. are designed to guide GUI agents in generating appropriate actions. Choose the template that best fits your use case:

### 🖥️ `COMPUTER_USE`

**Recommended for**: GUI tasks on **desktop environments** such as Windows, Linux, or macOS.

**Features**:
- Supports common desktop operations: mouse clicks (single, double, right), drag actions, keyboard shortcuts, text input, scrolling, etc.
- Ideal for browser navigation, office software interaction, file management, and other desktop-based tasks.


### 📱 `MOBILE_USE`

**Recommended for**: GUI tasks on **mobile devices or Android emulators**.

**Features**:
- Includes mobile-specific actions: `long_press`, `open_app`, `press_home`, `press_back`.
- Suitable for launching apps, scrolling views, filling input fields, and navigating within mobile apps.


### 📌 `GROUNDING` 

**Recommended for**: Lightweight tasks focused solely on **action output**, or for use in model training and evaluation.

**Features**:
- Only outputs the `Action` without any reasoning (`Thought`).
- Useful for evaluating grounding capability.

---

When developing or evaluating multimodal interaction systems, choose the appropriate prompt template based on your target platform (desktop vs. mobile)

## Model Scale Comparison

Here we compare performance across different model scales of UI-TARS on the OSworld benchmark.

| **Benchmark Type** | **Benchmark**                      | **UI-TARS-72B-DPO** | **UI-TARS-1.5-7B** | **UI-TARS-1.5** |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Computer Use       | [OSWorld](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07972)             | 24.6                | 27.5               | **42.5**        |
| GUI Grounding      | [ScreenSpotPro](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07981v1) | 38.1                | 49.6               | **61.6**        |

### Limitations

While UI-TARS-1.5 represents a significant advancement in multimodal agent capabilities, we acknowledge several important limitations:

- **Misuse:** Given its enhanced performance in GUI tasks, including successfully navigating authentication challenges like CAPTCHA, UI-TARS-1.5 could potentially be misused for unauthorized access or automation of protected content. To mitigate this risk, extensive internal safety evaluations are underway.
- **Computation:** UI-TARS-1.5 still requires substantial computational resources, particularly for large-scale tasks or extended gameplay scenarios.
- **Hallucination**: UI-TARS-1.5 may occasionally generate inaccurate descriptions, misidentify GUI elements, or take suboptimal actions based on incorrect inferences—especially in ambiguous or unfamiliar environments.
- **Model scale:** The released UI-TARS-1.5-7B focuses primarily on enhancing general computer use capabilities and is not specifically optimized for game-based scenarios, where the UI-TARS-1.5 still holds a significant advantage.

## What&#039;s next

We are providing early research access to our top-performing UI-TARS-1.5 model to facilitate collaborative research. Interested researchers can contact us at TARS@bytedance.com.

Looking ahead, we envision UI-TARS evolving into increasingly sophisticated agentic experiences capable of performing real-world actions, thereby empowering platforms such as [doubao](https://team.doubao.com/en/) to accomplish more complex tasks for you :)

## Overview

VoxCPM is a novel tokenizer-free Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that redefines realism in speech synthesis. By modeling speech in a continuous space, it overcomes the limitations of discrete tokenization and enables two flagship capabilities: context-aware speech generation and true-to-life zero-shot voice cloning.

Unlike mainstream approaches that convert speech to discrete tokens, VoxCPM uses an end-to-end diffusion autoregressive architecture that directly generates continuous speech representations from text. Built on [MiniCPM-4](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4-0.5B) backbone, it achieves implicit semantic-acoustic decoupling through hierachical language modeling and FSQ constraints, greatly enhancing both expressiveness and generation stability.

&lt;/div&gt;


###  🚀 Key Features
- **Context-Aware, Expressive Speech Generation** - VoxCPM comprehends text to infer and generate appropriate prosody, delivering speech with remarkable expressiveness and natural flow. It spontaneously adapts speaking style based on content, producing highly fitting vocal expression trained on a massive 1.8 million-hour bilingual corpus.
- **True-to-Life Voice Cloning** - With only a short reference audio clip, VoxCPM performs accurate zero-shot voice cloning, capturing not only the speaker&#039;s timbre but also fine-grained characteristics such as accent, emotional tone, rhythm, and pacing to create a faithful and natural replica.
- **High-Efficiency Synthesis** - VoxCPM supports streaming synthesis with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) as low as 0.17 on a consumer-grade NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, making it possible for real-time applications.

    prompt_text=None,          # optional: reference text
    cfg_value=2.0,             # LM guidance on LocDiT, higher for better adherence to the prompt, but maybe worse
    inference_timesteps=10,   # LocDiT inference timesteps, higher for better result, lower for fast speed
    normalize=False,           # enable external TN tool, but will disable native raw text support
    denoise=False,             # enable external Denoise tool, but it may cause some distortion and restrict the sampling rate to 16kHz
    retry_badcase=True,        # enable retrying mode for some bad cases (unstoppable)
    retry_badcase_max_times=3,  # maximum retrying times

## ⚠️ Risks and limitations
- General Model Behavior: While VoxCPM has been trained on a large-scale dataset, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or contain artifacts.
- Potential for Misuse of Voice Cloning: VoxCPM&#039;s powerful zero-shot voice cloning capability can generate highly realistic synthetic speech. This technology could be misused for creating convincing deepfakes for purposes of impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users of this model must not use it to create content that infringes upon the rights of individuals. It is strictly forbidden to use VoxCPM for any illegal or unethical purposes. We strongly recommend that any publicly shared content generated with this model be clearly marked as AI-generated.
- Current Technical Limitations: Although generally stable, the model may occasionally exhibit instability, especially with very long or expressive inputs. Furthermore, the current version offers limited direct control over specific speech attributes like emotion or speaking style.
- Bilingual Model: VoxCPM is trained primarily on Chinese and English data. Performance on other languages is not guaranteed and may result in unpredictable or low-quality audio.
- This model is released for research and development purposes only. We do not recommend its use in production or commercial applications without rigorous testing and safety evaluations. Please use VoxCPM responsibly.

- ✅ 性能监控（LLM 耗时、动作执行统计）
- ✅ 详细的操作指南和错误避免提示

&lt;a id=&quot;mode-classic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### 🌿 普通模式（单模型 / Open AutoGLM）

这是**开源 AutoGLM-Phone 的“原生形态”**：由一个视觉模型直接完成「理解任务 → 规划步骤 → 观察屏幕 → 执行动作」的完整闭环。

- **优点**：配置最简单，上手最快
- **适用场景**：目标明确、步骤较少的任务（例如打开应用、简单导航）

&lt;a id=&quot;mode-layered&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
### 🧩 分层代理模式（Layered Agent，增强 / 实验性）

分层代理模式是更“严格”的两层结构：**规划层**专注拆解与推理，**执行层**专注观察与操作，二者通过工具调用协作完成任务。

- **工作方式**：规划层（决策模型）会调用工具（如 `list_devices()` / `chat(device_id, message)`）去驱动执行层；你能在界面里看到每次工具调用与返回结果
- **执行粒度**：执行层每次只做一个“原子子任务”，并有步数上限（例如每次最多 5 步），便于规划层按反馈动态调整策略
- **适用场景**：需要多轮推理、需要“边看边问边改计划”的复杂任务（例如浏览/筛选/对比、多轮表单填写等）
- **重要限制**：执行层不负责&quot;记笔记/保存中间信息/直接提取文本变量&quot;；规划层需要信息时必须通过提问让执行层把屏幕内容&quot;念出来&quot;

&gt; 📖 **深入了解**：查看 [Layered Agent 架构分析文档](./docs/docs/layered_agent_analysis.md) 了解技术原理、数据流和实现细节

### 🎭 两种工作模式对比

AutoGLM-GUI 提供了两种不同的代理工作模式，适用于不同的使用场景：

#### 1️⃣ 经典模式（Classic Mode）
- **架构**：单一 `autoglm-phone` 视觉模型直接处理（即普通 Open AutoGLM 的体验）
- **适用场景**：简单、明确的任务
- **特点**：配置简单，适合快速上手

#### 2️⃣ 分层代理（Layered Agent）
- **架构**：基于 Agent SDK 的分层任务执行系统
  - **规划层**：决策模型作为高级智能中枢，负责任务拆解和多轮推理
  - **执行层**：autoglm-phone 作为执行者，只负责观察和操作
- **适用场景**：需要多轮交互和复杂推理的高级任务
- **特点**：规划层通过工具调用驱动执行层，过程更透明、更便于调试与迭代策略

**选择建议**：
- 🚀 **常规任务（订外卖、打车）**：经典模式
- 🏗️ **需要多轮推理的任务**：分层代理模式

## 🔌 MCP (Model Context Protocol) 集成

AutoGLM-GUI 内置了 MCP 服务器，可以作为一个工具集成为其他 AI 应用（如 Claude Desktop、Cline、Cursor 等）提供 Android 设备自动化能力。

### 什么是 MCP？

MCP (Model Context Protocol) 是一个开放协议，允许 AI 应用连接到外部数据源和工具。通过 MCP，你可以让 Claude、Cursor 等 AI 直接操作你的 Android 设备。

### MCP Tools

AutoGLM-GUI 提供了两个 MCP 工具：

#### 1. `chat(device_id, message)` - 执行手机任务

向指定设备发送自动化任务，AI 会控制手机完成操作。

**参数**：
- `device_id`：设备标识符（如 &quot;192.168.1.100:5555&quot; 或设备序列号）
- `message`：自然语言任务描述（如 &quot;打开微信&quot;、&quot;发送消息&quot;）

**特点**：
- ✅ 自动初始化设备（使用全局配置）
- ✅ **Fail-Fast 策略**：找不到元素立即报错，不猜测坐标
- ✅ **5 步限制**：适合原子操作，避免无限循环
- ✅ **专用 Prompt**：优化为快速执行模式

#### 2. `list_devices()` - 列出已连接设备

获取所有已连接的 ADB 设备列表及其状态。

**返回信息**：
- 设备 ID、型号
- 连接类型（USB/WiFi）
- 在线状态
- Agent 初始化状态

### 使用场景

**典型应用**：
- 🤝 **Claude Desktop**：让 Claude 直接操作你的 Android 设备
- 💻 **IDE 集成**：在 Cursor、VS Code (Cline) 中调用手机自动化
- 🔄 **工作流集成**：作为 AI Agent 工具链的一环
- 🧪 **自动化测试**：结合 AI 进行移动端 UI 测试

**示例**：
```
用户：帮我在手机上打开微信，给张三发消息&quot;下午三点开会&quot;

AI：
1. 调用 list_devices() 找到设备
2. 调用 chat(device_id, &quot;打开微信&quot;)
3. 调用 chat(device_id, &quot;搜索联系人张三&quot;)
4. 调用 chat(device_id, &quot;发送消息：下午三点开会&quot;)
```

### 配置 MCP 客户端

#### Claude Desktop 配置

1. **启动 AutoGLM-GUI**（确保 MCP 端点可访问）：

```bash
# 使用默认 MCP 端点（挂载在 /mcp）
autoglm-gui --base-url http://localhost:8080/v1
```

2. **编辑 Claude Desktop 配置文件**：

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

添加以下配置：

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;autoglm-gui&quot;: {
      &quot;transport&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8000/mcp&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **重启 Claude Desktop**，即可在对话中使用 AutoGLM-GUI 工具。

#### Cline (VS Code) 配置

在 VS Code 设置中搜索 &quot;cline&quot;，添加 MCP 服务器配置：

```json
{
  &quot;cline.mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;autoglm-gui&quot;: {
      &quot;transport&quot;: {
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8000/mcp&quot;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor 配置

在 Cursor 设置中添加 MCP 服务器（设置 → MCP Servers）：

```json
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;autoglm-gui&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:8000/mcp&quot;
  }
}
```

### MCP 端点说明

AutoGLM-GUI 的 MCP 服务器通过 HTTP 端点暴露：

- **Base URL**：`http://localhost:8000/mcp`
- **传输协议**：HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **端口**：跟随主服务端口（默认 8000）

**端点路径**：
- `/mcp/sse` - SSE 传输端点
- `/mcp/messages` - 消息端点

### 技术架构

**实现方式**：
- 基于 **FastMCP** 库构建
- MCP HTTP App 挂载到 FastAPI 的根路径 `/`
- 使用 ASGI 应用集成，与 FastAPI 生命周期合并
- 设备锁管理：使用 `PhoneAgentManager.use_agent` 上下文管理器

**专用 Prompt 特性**：
- **Fail-Fast**：找不到元素立即报错，禁止猜测坐标
- **Step Limit**：5 步未完成自动中断
- **目标验证**：执行前必须确认元素在屏幕上可见
- **错误规范**：使用 `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND` 和 `STEP_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` 标准化错误

### 最佳实践

1. **原子任务**：MCP 的 `chat` 工具设计用于执行原子操作（5 步内完成），复杂任务应拆分为多个子任务
2. **设备管理**：使用 `list_devices()` 先确认设备在线，再执行操作
3. **错误处理**：AI 应捕获 `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND` 错误，调整策略后重试
4. **性能优化**：MCP 调用优先使用本地 API（如 vLLM/SGLang），减少网络延迟

### 示例对话

**在 Claude Desktop 中**：

```
用户：帮我查一下手机上有几台设备连接了

Claude：我调用 list_devices() 工具查看一下...

[MCP 工具调用] list_devices()

结果：发现 1 台设备
- 设备 ID: emulator-5554
- 型号: sdk_gphone64_x86_64
- 状态: 在线

用户：在模拟器上打开设置应用

Claude：我调用 chat 工具来操作设备...

[MCP 工具调用] chat(&quot;emulator-5554&quot;, &quot;打开设置应用&quot;)

执行结果：✅ 已完成
步骤 1: Launch(app=&quot;设置&quot;)
步骤 2: 等待应用加载
步骤 3: 完成

设置应用已成功打开。
```

## 🐳 Docker 部署详细说明

&gt; 💡 **提示**：Docker 部署已整合到 [快速开始](#-快速开始) 部分，推荐直接查看上方的&quot;方式二：Docker 部署&quot;说明。

本节提供更多 Docker 配置选项和高级用法。

### 指定监听端口

如果使用 host 网络模式且需要修改默认端口（8000），可以通过 `command` 参数指定：

```bash

[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai) is an open ecosystem that empowers AI developers
to choose the right tools as their project evolves. ONNX provides an open source format for AI models, both deep learning and traditional ML. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard
data types. Currently we focus on the capabilities needed for inferencing (scoring).

ONNX is [widely supported](http://onnx.ai/supported-tools) and can be found in many frameworks, tools, and hardware. Enabling interoperability between different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to production helps increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. We invite the community to join us and further evolve ONNX.

# Roadmap

A roadmap process takes place every year. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/tree/main/roadmap)

# Installation

ONNX released packages are published in PyPi.

```sh
pip install onnx # or pip install onnx[reference] for optional reference implementation dependencies
```

[ONNX weekly packages](https://pypi.org/project/onnx-weekly/) are published in PyPI to enable experimentation and early testing.

Detailed install instructions, including Common Build Options and Common Errors can be found [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

# Python ABI3 Compatibility

This package provides [abi3](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html)-compatible wheels, allowing a single binary wheel to work across multiple Python versions (from 3.12 onwards).


# Testing

ONNX uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) as test driver. In order to run tests, you will first need to install `pytest`:

```sh
pip install pytest
```

After installing pytest, use the following command to run tests.

```sh
pytest
```

# Development

Check out the [contributor guide](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.

# Reproducible Builds (Linux)

This project provides reproducible builds for Linux.

A *reproducible build* means that the same source code will always produce identical binary outputs, no matter who builds it or where it is built.

To achieve this, we use the [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/) standard. This ensures that build timestamps and other time-dependent information are fixed, making the output bit-for-bit identical across different environments.

### Why this matters
- **Transparency**: Anyone can verify that the distributed binaries were created from the published source code.
- **Security**: Prevents tampering or hidden changes in the build process.
- **Trust**: Users can be confident that the binaries they download are exactly what the maintainers intended.

If you prefer, you can use the prebuilt reproducible binaries instead of building from source yourself.

&lt;/div&gt;

**MiniCPM-o** is the latest series of on-device multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) ungraded from MiniCPM-V. The models can now take image, video, text, and audio as inputs and provide high-quality text and speech outputs in an end-to-end fashion. The model series is designed for **strong performance and efficient deployment**. The most notable models in the series currently include:


- **MiniCPM-o 4.5**: 🔥🔥🔥 The latest and most capable model in the series. With a total of 9B parameters, this end-to-end model **approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash in vision, speech, and full-duplex multimodal live streaming**, making it one of the most versatile and performant models in the open-source community. The new full-duplex multimodal live streaming capability means that the output streams (speech and text), and the real-time input streams (video and audio) do not block each other. This **enables MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously** in a real-time omnimodal conversation, and perform **proactive interactions** such as proactive reminding. The improved voice mode supports bilingual real-time speech conversation in a more natural, expressive, and stable way, and also allows for voice cloning. It also advances MiniCPM-V&#039;s visual capabilities such as strong OCR capability, trustworthy behavior and multilingual support, etc. We also rollout a **high-performing llama.cpp-omni inference framework together with a WebRTC Demo**, to bring this full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience [available on local devices such as Macs](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/WebRTC_Demo/README.md).

- **MiniCPM-V 4.0**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ An efficient model in the MiniCPM-V series. With a total of 4B parameters, the model surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414 in image understanding on the OpenCompass evaluation. With its small parameter-size and efficient architecure, MiniCPM-V 4.0 is an ideal choice for on-device deployment on the phone.

## MiniCPM-o 4.5

**MiniCPM-o 4.5** is the latest and most capable model in the MiniCPM-o series. The model is built in an end-to-end fashion based on SigLip2, Whisper-medium, CosyVoice2, and Qwen3-8B with a total of 9B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement, and introduces new features for full-duplex multimodal live streaming. Notable features of MiniCPM-o 4.5 include:

- 🔥 **Leading Visual Capability.**
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 achieves an average score of 77.6 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. **With only 9B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash** for vision-language capabilities. It supports instruct and thinking modes in a single model, better covering efficiency and performance trade-offs in different user scenarios.

- 🎙 **Strong Speech Capability.** 
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 supports **bilingual real-time speech conversation with configurable voices** in English and Chinese. It features **more natural, expressive and stable speech conversation**. The model also allows for fun features such as **voice cloning and role play via a simple reference audio clip**, where the cloning performance surpasses strong TTS tools such as CosyVoice2.

- 🎬 **New Full-Duplex and Proactive Multimodal Live Streaming Capability.** 
  As a new feature, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process real-time, continuous video and audio input streams simultaneously while generating concurrent text and speech output streams in an end-to-end fashion, without mutual blocking. This **allows MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously**, creating a fluid, real-time omnimodal conversation experience. Beyond reactive responses, the model can also perform **proactive interaction**, such as initiating reminders or comments based on its continuous understanding of the live scene. 

- 💪 **Strong OCR Capability, Efficiency and Others.**
Advancing popular visual capabilities from MiniCPM-V series, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process **high-resolution images** (up to 1.8 million pixels) and **high-FPS videos** (up to 10fps) in any aspect ratio efficiently. It achieves **state-of-the-art peformance for end-to-end English document parsing** on OmniDocBench, outperforming proprietary models such as Gemini-3 Flash and GPT-5, and specialized tools such as DeepSeek-OCR 2. It also features **trustworthy behaviors**, matching Gemini 2.5 Flash on MMHal-Bench, and supports **multilingual capabilities** on more than 30 languages.

-  💫  **Easy Usage.**
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 can be easily used in various ways: (1) [llama.cpp](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/llama.cpp/minicpm-o4_5_llamacpp.md) and [Ollama](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/ollama/minicpm-o4_5_ollama.md) support for efficient CPU inference on local devices, (2) [int4](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/quantization/awq/minicpm-o4_5_awq_quantize.md) and [GGUF](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/quantization/gguf/minicpm-o4_5_gguf_quantize.md) format quantized models in 16 sizes, (3) [vLLM](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/vllm/minicpm-o4_5_vllm.md) and [SGLang](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/sglang/MiniCPM-o4_5_sglang.md) support for high-throughput and memory-efficient inference, (4) [FlagOS](#flagos) support for the unified multi-chip backend plugin, (5) fine-tuning on new domains and tasks with [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/finetune/llama-factory/finetune_llamafactory.md), and (6) online web demo on [server](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/gradio/README_o45.md). We also rollout a high-performing [llama.cpp-omni](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni) inference framework together with a [WebRTC Demo](https://minicpm-omni.openbmb.cn/), which **enables the full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience on local devices** such as [PCs](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni/blob/master/README.md) (e.g., on a MacBook).

**Model Architecture.**
- **End-to-end Omni-modal Architecture.** The modality encoders/decoders and LLM are densely connected via hidden states in an end-to-end fashion. This enables better information flow and control, and also facilitates full exploitation of rich multimodal knowledge during training.
- **Full-Duplex Omni-modal Live Streaming Mechanism.** (1) We turn the offline modality encoder/decoders into online and full-duplex ones for streaming inputs/outputs. The speech token decoder models text and speech tokens in an interleaved fashion to support full-duplex speech generation (i.e., sync timely with new input). This also facilitates more stable long speech generation (e.g., &gt; 1min).
(2) **We sync all the input and output streams on timeline in milliseconds**, which are jointly modeled by a time-division multiplexing (TDM) mechanism for omni-modality streaming processing in the LLM backbone. It divides parallel omni-modality streams into sequential info groups within small periodic time slices.
- **Proactive Interaction Mechanism.** The LLM continuously monitors the input video and audio streams, and decides at a frequency of 1Hz to speak or not. This high decision-making frequency together with full-duplex nature are curcial to enable the proactive interaction capability.
- **Configurable Speech Modeling Design.** We inherent the multimodal system prompt design of MiniCPM-o 2.6, which includes a traditional text system prompt, and a new audio system prompt to determine the assistant voice. This enables cloning new voices and role play in inference time for speech conversation.

## Performance Demonstration

Many current open-source SOTA models are trained and evaluated on academic datasets, achieving high-quality results only on single document types. To enable models to achieve stable and robust high-quality results on diverse documents, we constructed diverse fine-tuning datasets and fine-tuned some SOTA models to obtain practical parsing models. Below are some visual results of the models.

### Layout Detection

We trained robust `Layout Detection` models using diverse PDF document annotations. Our fine-tuned models achieve accurate extraction results on diverse PDF documents such as papers, textbooks, research reports, and financial reports, and demonstrate high robustness to challenges like blurring and watermarks. The visualization example below shows the inference results of the fine-tuned LayoutLMv3 model.
 
![](assets/readme/layout_example.png)

### Formula Detection

Similarly, we collected and annotated documents containing formulas in both English and Chinese, and fine-tuned advanced formula detection models. The visualization result below shows the inference results of the fine-tuned YOLO formula detection model:

![](assets/readme/mfd_example.png)

### Formula Recognition

[UniMERNet](https://github.com/opendatalab/UniMERNet) is an algorithm designed for diverse formula recognition in real-world scenarios. By constructing large-scale training data and carefully designed results, it achieves excellent recognition performance for complex long formulas, handwritten formulas, and noisy screenshot formulas.

### Table Recognition

[StructEqTable](https://github.com/UniModal4Reasoning/StructEqTable-Deploy) is a high efficiency toolkit that can converts table images into LaTeX/HTML/MarkDown. The latest version, powered by the InternVL2-1B foundation model,  improves Chinese recognition accuracy and expands multi-format output options.

&gt; This project focuses on using models for `high-quality` content extraction from `diverse` documents and does not involve reconstructing extracted content into new documents, such as PDF to Markdown. For such needs, please refer to our other GitHub project: [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU).

## To-Do List

- [x] **Table Parsing**: Develop functionality to convert table images into corresponding LaTeX/Markdown format source code.
- [ ] **Chemical Equation Detection**: Implement automatic detection of chemical equations.
- [ ] **Chemical Equation/Diagram Recognition**: Develop models to recognize and parse chemical equations and diagrams.
- [ ] **Reading Order Sorting Model**: Build a model to determine the correct reading order of text in documents.

**PDF-Extract-Kit** aims to provide high-quality PDF content extraction capabilities. We encourage the community to propose specific and valuable needs and welcome everyone to participate in continuously improving the PDF-Extract-Kit tool to advance research and industry development.
