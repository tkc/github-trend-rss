            <h2>README</h2><pre># AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Aswath Damodaran Agent - The Dean of Valuation, focuses on story, numbers, and disciplined valuation
2. Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
3. Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investor, takes bold positions and pushes for change
4. Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
5. Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett&#039;s partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
6. Michael Burry Agent - The Big Short contrarian who hunts for deep value
7. Peter Lynch Agent - Practical investor who seeks &quot;ten-baggers&quot; in everyday businesses
8. Phil Fisher Agent - Meticulous growth investor who uses deep &quot;scuttlebutt&quot; research 
9. Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential
10. Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
11. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
12. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
13. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
14. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
15. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
16. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## Setup

### Using Poetry

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

### Using Docker

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Docker&#039;s official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit the .env file to add your API keys as described above.

5. Build the Docker image:
```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh build

# On Windows:
run.bat build
```

**Important**: You must set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for the hedge fund to work.  If you want to use LLMs from all providers, you will need to set all API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund

#### With Poetry
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

#### With Docker
```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA main

# On Windows:
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA main
```

**Example Output:**
&lt;img width=&quot;992&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b&quot; /&gt;

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama

# With Docker (on Linux/Mac):
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama main

# With Docker (on Windows):
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama main
```

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning

# With Docker (on Linux/Mac):
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning main

# With Docker (on Windows):
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning main
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 

# With Docker (on Linux/Mac):
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 main

# With Docker (on Windows):
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 main
```

### Running the Backtester

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to backtest over a specific time period.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01

# With Docker (on Linux/Mac):
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 backtest

# With Docker (on Windows):
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 backtest
```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the backtester using local LLMs.

---

This may not be the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework.

Due to its extreme simplicity, it aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training. If XLA is CISC, tinygrad is RISC.

tinygrad is still alpha software, but we [raised some money](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/05/24/the-tiny-corp-raised-5M.html) to make it good. Someday, we will tape out chips.

## Features

### LLaMA and Stable Diffusion

tinygrad can run [LLaMA](/docs/showcase.md#llama) and [Stable Diffusion](/docs/showcase.md#stable-diffusion)!

### Laziness

Try a matmul. See how, despite the style, it is fused into one kernel with the power of laziness.

```sh
DEBUG=3 python3 -c &quot;from tinygrad import Tensor;
N = 1024; a, b = Tensor.rand(N, N), Tensor.rand(N, N);
c = (a.reshape(N, 1, N) * b.T.reshape(1, N, N)).sum(axis=2);
print((c.numpy() - (a.numpy() @ b.numpy())).mean())&quot;
```

And we can change `DEBUG` to `4` to see the generated code.

### Neural networks

As it turns out, 90% of what you need for neural networks are a decent autograd/tensor library.
Throw in an optimizer, a data loader, and some compute, and you have all you need.

```python
from tinygrad import Tensor, nn

class LinearNet:
  def __init__(self):
    self.l1 = Tensor.kaiming_uniform(784, 128)
    self.l2 = Tensor.kaiming_uniform(128, 10)
  def __call__(self, x:Tensor) -&gt; Tensor:
    return x.flatten(1).dot(self.l1).relu().dot(self.l2)

model = LinearNet()
optim = nn.optim.Adam([model.l1, model.l2], lr=0.001)

x, y = Tensor.rand(4, 1, 28, 28), Tensor([2,4,3,7])  # replace with real mnist dataloader

with Tensor.train():
  for i in range(10):
    optim.zero_grad()
    loss = model(x).sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y).backward()
    optim.step()
    print(i, loss.item())
```

See [examples/beautiful_mnist.py](examples/beautiful_mnist.py) for the full version that gets 98% in ~5 seconds

## Accelerators

tinygrad already supports numerous accelerators, including:

- [x] [GPU (OpenCL)](tinygrad/runtime/ops_gpu.py)
- [x] [CPU (C Code)](tinygrad/runtime/ops_cpu.py)
- [x] [LLVM](tinygrad/runtime/ops_llvm.py)
- [x] [METAL](tinygrad/runtime/ops_metal.py)
- [x] [CUDA](tinygrad/runtime/ops_cuda.py)
- [x] [AMD](tinygrad/runtime/ops_amd.py)
- [x] [NV](tinygrad/runtime/ops_nv.py)
- [x] [QCOM](tinygrad/runtime/ops_qcom.py)
- [x] [WEBGPU](tinygrad/runtime/ops_webgpu.py)

And it is easy to add more! Your accelerator of choice only needs to support a total of ~25 low level ops.

To check default accelerator run: `python3 -c &quot;from tinygrad import Device; print(Device.DEFAULT)&quot;`

## Installation

The current recommended way to install tinygrad is from source.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad.git
cd tinygrad
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Direct (master)

```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad.git
```

## Documentation

Documentation along with a quick start guide can be found on the [docs website](https://docs.tinygrad.org/) built from the [docs/](/docs) directory.

### Quick example comparing to PyTorch

```python
from tinygrad import Tensor

x = Tensor.eye(3, requires_grad=True)
y = Tensor([[2.0,0,-2.0]], requires_grad=True)
z = y.matmul(x).sum()
z.backward()

print(x.grad.tolist())  # dz/dx
print(y.grad.tolist())  # dz/dy
```

The same thing but in PyTorch:
```python
import torch

x = torch.eye(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0,0,-2.0]], requires_grad=True)
z = y.matmul(x).sum()
z.backward()

print(x.grad.tolist())  # dz/dx
print(y.grad.tolist())  # dz/dy
```

## Contributing

There has been a lot of interest in tinygrad lately. Following these guidelines will help your PR get accepted.

We&#039;ll start with what will get your PR closed with a pointer to this section:

- No code golf! While low line count is a guiding light of this project, anything that remotely looks like code golf will be closed. The true goal is reducing complexity and increasing readability, and deleting `\n`s does nothing to help with that.
- All docs and whitespace changes will be closed unless you are a well-known contributor. The people writing the docs should be those who know the codebase the absolute best. People who have not demonstrated that shouldn&#039;t be messing with docs. Whitespace changes are both useless *and* carry a risk of introducing bugs.
- Anything you claim is a &quot;speedup&quot; must be benchmarked. In general, the goal is simplicity, so even if your PR makes things marginally faster, you have to consider the tradeoff with maintainability and readability.
- In general, the code outside the core `tinygrad/` folder is not well tested, so unless the current code there is broken, you shouldn&#039;t be changing it.
- If your PR looks &quot;complex&quot;, is a big diff, or adds lots of lines, it won&#039;t be reviewed or merged. Consider breaking it up into smaller PRs that are individually clear wins. A common pattern I see is prerequisite refactors before adding new functionality. If you can (cleanly) refactor to the point that the feature is a 3 line change, this is great, and something easy for us to review.

Now, what we want:

- Bug fixes (with a regression test) are great! This library isn&#039;t 1.0 yet, so if you stumble upon a bug, fix it, write a test, and submit a PR, this is valuable work.
- Solving bounties! tinygrad [offers cash bounties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WKHbT-7KOgjEawq5h5Ic1qUWzpfAzuD_J06N1JwOCGs/edit?usp=sharing) for certain improvements to the library. All new code should be high quality and well tested.
- Features. However, if you are adding a feature, consider the line tradeoff. If it&#039;s 3 lines, there&#039;s less of a bar of usefulness it has to meet over something that&#039;s 30 or 300 lines. All features must have regression tests. In general with no other constraints, your feature&#039;s API should match torch or numpy.
- Refactors that are clear wins. In general, if your refactor isn&#039;t a clear win it will be closed. But some refactors are amazing! Think about readability in a deep core sense. A whitespace change or moving a few functions around is useless, but if you realize that two 100 line functions can actually use the same 110 line function with arguments while also improving readability, this is a big win. Refactors should pass [process replay](#process-replay-tests).
- Tests/fuzzers. If you can add tests that are non brittle, they are welcome. We have some fuzzers in here too, and there&#039;s a plethora of bugs that can be found with them and by improving them. Finding bugs, even writing broken tests (that should pass) with `@unittest.expectedFailure` is great. This is how we make progress.
- Dead code removal from core `tinygrad/` folder. We don&#039;t care about the code in extra, but removing dead code from the core library is great. Less for new people to read and be confused by.

### Running tests

You should install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`. This will run the linter, mypy, and a subset of the tests on every commit.

For more examples on how to run the full test suite please refer to the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test.yml).

Some examples of running tests locally:
```sh
python3 -m pip install -e &#039;.[testing]&#039;  # install extra deps for testing
python3 test/test_ops.py                # just the ops tests
python3 -m pytest test/                 # whole test suite
```

#### Process replay tests

[Process replay](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/test/external/process_replay/README.md) compares your PR&#039;s generated kernels against master. If your PR is a refactor or speedup without any expected behavior change, It should include [pr] in the pull request title.

&lt;summary&gt;🤓 &lt;strong&gt;My Personal Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

My journey with computers started in childhood when my dad, a computer scientist, introduced me to an Amstrad computer. Those early days sparked a fascination with technology, leading me to pursue computer science and specialize in NLP during my postgraduate studies. It was during this time that I first delved into web crawling, building tools to help researchers organize papers and extract information from publications a challenging yet rewarding experience that honed my skills in data extraction.

Fast forward to 2023, I was working on a tool for a project and needed a crawler to convert a webpage into markdown. While exploring solutions, I found one that claimed to be open-source but required creating an account and generating an API token. Worse, it turned out to be a SaaS model charging $16, and its quality didn’t meet my standards. Frustrated, I realized this was a deeper problem. That frustration turned into turbo anger mode, and I decided to build my own solution. In just a few days, I created Crawl4AI. To my surprise, it went viral, earning thousands of GitHub stars and resonating with a global community.

I made Crawl4AI open-source for two reasons. First, it’s my way of giving back to the open-source community that has supported me throughout my career. Second, I believe data should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind paywalls or monopolized by a few. Open access to data lays the foundation for the democratization of AI, a vision where individuals can train their own models and take ownership of their information. This library is the first step in a larger journey to create the best open-source data extraction and generation tool the world has ever seen, built collaboratively by a passionate community.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this project, used it, and shared feedback. Your encouragement motivates me to dream even bigger. Join us, file issues, submit PRs, or spread the word. Together, we can build a tool that truly empowers people to access their own data and reshape the future of AI.
&lt;/details&gt;

## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;🐍 &lt;strong&gt;Using pip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup # Setup the browser
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the `crawl4ai-setup` should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. If the above doesn&#039;t work, try this more specific command:

   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

---

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode
```

Install optional features:

```bash
pip install -e &quot;.[torch]&quot;           # With PyTorch features
pip install -e &quot;.[transformer]&quot;     # With Transformer features
pip install -e &quot;.[cosine]&quot;          # With cosine similarity features
pip install -e &quot;.[sync]&quot;            # With synchronous crawling (Selenium)
pip install -e &quot;.[all]&quot;             # Install all optional features
```

&lt;/details&gt;

Training and inference code for audio generation models

# Install

The library can be installed from PyPI with:
```bash
$ pip install stable-audio-tools
```

To run the training scripts or inference code, you&#039;ll want to clone this repository, navigate to the root, and run:
```bash
$ pip install .
```

# Requirements
Requires PyTorch 2.5 or later for Flash Attention and Flex Attention support

Development for the repo is done in Python 3.10

# Interface

A basic Gradio interface is provided to test out trained models. 

For example, to create an interface for the [`stable-audio-open-1.0`](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0) model, once you&#039;ve accepted the terms for the model on Hugging Face, you can run:
```bash
$ python3 ./run_gradio.py --pretrained-name stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0
```

The `run_gradio.py` script accepts the following command line arguments:

- `--pretrained-name`
  - Hugging Face repository name for a Stable Audio Tools model
  - Will prioritize `model.safetensors` over `model.ckpt` in the repo
  - Optional, used in place of `model-config` and `ckpt-path` when using pre-trained model checkpoints on Hugging Face
- `--model-config`
  - Path to the model config file for a local model
- `--ckpt-path`
  - Path to unwrapped model checkpoint file for a local model
- `--pretransform-ckpt-path` 
  - Path to an unwrapped pretransform checkpoint, replaces the pretransform in the model, useful for testing out fine-tuned decoders
  - Optional
- `--share`
  - If true, a publicly shareable link will be created for the Gradio demo
  - Optional
- `--username` and `--password`
  - Used together to set a login for the Gradio demo
  - Optional
- `--model-half`
  - If true, the model weights to half-precision
  - Optional

# Training

## Prerequisites
Before starting your training run, you&#039;ll need a model config file, as well as a dataset config file. For more information about those, refer to the Configurations section below

The training code also requires a Weights &amp; Biases account to log the training outputs and demos. Create an account and log in with:
```bash
$ wandb login
```

## Start training
To start a training run, run the `train.py` script in the repo root with:
```bash
$ python3 ./train.py --dataset-config /path/to/dataset/config --model-config /path/to/model/config --name harmonai_train
```

The `--name` parameter will set the project name for your Weights and Biases run.

## Training wrappers and model unwrapping
`stable-audio-tools` uses PyTorch Lightning to facilitate multi-GPU and multi-node training. 

When a model is being trained, it is wrapped in a &quot;training wrapper&quot;, which is a `pl.LightningModule` that contains all of the relevant objects needed only for training. That includes things like discriminators for autoencoders, EMA copies of models, and all of the optimizer states.

The checkpoint files created during training include this training wrapper, which greatly increases the size of the checkpoint file.

`unwrap_model.py` in the repo root will take in a wrapped model checkpoint and save a new checkpoint file including only the model itself.

That can be run with from the repo root with:
```bash
$ python3 ./unwrap_model.py --model-config /path/to/model/config --ckpt-path /path/to/wrapped/ckpt --name model_unwrap
```

Unwrapped model checkpoints are required for:
  - Inference scripts
  - Using a model as a pretransform for another model (e.g. using an autoencoder model for latent diffusion)
  - Fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a modified configuration (i.e. partial initialization)

## Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning a model involves continuning a training run from a pre-trained checkpoint. 

To continue a training run from a wrapped model checkpoint, you can pass in the checkpoint path to `train.py` with the `--ckpt-path` flag.

To start a fresh training run using a pre-trained unwrapped model, you can pass in the unwrapped checkpoint to `train.py` with the `--pretrained-ckpt-path` flag.

## Additional training flags

Additional optional flags for `train.py` include:
- `--config-file`
  - The path to the defaults.ini file in the repo root, required if running `train.py` from a directory other than the repo root
- `--pretransform-ckpt-path`
  - Used in various model types such as latent diffusion models to load a pre-trained autoencoder. Requires an unwrapped model checkpoint.

# Configurations
Training and inference code for `stable-audio-tools` is based around JSON configuration files that define model hyperparameters, training settings, and information about your training dataset.

## Model config
The model config file defines all of the information needed to load a model for training or inference. It also contains the training configuration needed to fine-tune a model or train from scratch.

The following properties are defined in the top level of the model configuration:

- `model_type`
  - The type of model being defined, currently limited to one of `&quot;autoencoder&quot;, &quot;diffusion_uncond&quot;, &quot;diffusion_cond&quot;, &quot;diffusion_cond_inpaint&quot;, &quot;diffusion_autoencoder&quot;, &quot;lm&quot;`.
- `sample_size`
  - The length of the audio provided to the model during training, in samples. For diffusion models, this is also the raw audio sample length used for inference.
- `sample_rate`
  - The sample rate of the audio provided to the model during training, and generated during inference, in Hz.
- `audio_channels`
  - The number of channels of audio provided to the model during training, and generated during inference. Defaults to 2. Set to 1 for mono.
- `model`
  - The specific configuration for the model being defined, varies based on `model_type`
- `training`
  - The training configuration for the model, varies based on `model_type`. Provides parameters for training as well as demos.

## Dataset config
`stable-audio-tools` currently supports two kinds of data sources: local directories of audio files, and WebDataset datasets stored in Amazon S3. More information can be found in [the dataset config documentation](docs/datasets.md)

NetBox exists to empower network engineers. Since its release in 2016, it has become the go-to solution for modeling and documenting network infrastructure for thousands of organizations worldwide. As a successor to legacy IPAM and DCIM applications, NetBox provides a cohesive, extensive, and accessible data model for all things networked. By providing a single robust user interface and programmable APIs for everything from cable maps to device configurations, NetBox serves as the central source of truth for the modern network.

&lt;/p&gt;

## NetBox&#039;s Role

NetBox functions as the **source of truth** for your network infrastructure. Its job is to define and validate the _intended state_ of all network components and resources. NetBox does not interact with network nodes directly; rather, it makes this data available programmatically to purpose-built automation, monitoring, and assurance tools. This separation of duties enables the construction of a robust yet flexible automation system.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;docs/media/misc/reference_architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reference network automation architecture&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

The diagram above illustrates the recommended deployment architecture for an automated network, leveraging NetBox as the central authority for network state. This approach allows your team to swap out individual tools to meet changing needs while retaining a predictable, modular workflow.

## Why NetBox?

### Comprehensive Data Model

Racks, devices, cables, IP addresses, VLANs, circuits, power, VPNs, and lots more: NetBox is built for networks. Its comprehensive and thoroughly inter-linked data model provides for natural and highly structured modeling of myriad network primitives that just isn&#039;t possible using general-purpose tools. And there&#039;s no need to waste time contemplating how to build out a database: Everything is ready to go upon installation.

### Focused Development

NetBox strives to meet a singular goal: Provide the best available solution for making network infrastructure programmatically accessible. Unlike &quot;all-in-one&quot; tools which awkwardly bolt on half-baked features in an attempt to check every box, NetBox is committed to its core function. NetBox provides the best possible solution for modeling network infrastructure, and provides rich APIs for integrating with tools that excel in other areas of network automation.

### Extensible and Customizable

No two networks are exactly the same. Users are empowered to extend NetBox&#039;s native data model with custom fields and tags to best suit their unique needs. You can even write your own plugins to introduce entirely new objects and functionality!

### Flexible Permissions

NetBox includes a fully customizable permission system, which affords administrators incredible granularity when assigning roles to users and groups. Want to restrict certain users to working only with cabling and not be able to change IP addresses? Or maybe each team should have access only to a particular tenant? NetBox enables you to craft roles as you see fit.

### Custom Validation &amp; Protection Rules

The data you put into NetBox is crucial to network operations. In addition to its robust native validation rules, NetBox provides mechanisms for administrators to define their own custom validation rules for objects. Custom validation can be used both to ensure new or modified objects adhere to a set of rules, and to prevent the deletion of objects which don&#039;t meet certain criteria. (For example, you might want to prevent the deletion of a device with an &quot;active&quot; status.)

### Device Configuration Rendering

NetBox can render user-created Jinja2 templates to generate device configurations from its own data. Configuration templates can be uploaded individually or pulled automatically from an external source, such as a git repository. Rendered configurations can be retrieved via the REST API for application directly to network devices via a provisioning tool such as Ansible or Salt.

### Custom Scripts

Complex workflows, such as provisioning a new branch office, can be tedious to carry out via the user interface. NetBox allows you to write and upload custom scripts that can be run directly from the UI. Scripts prompt users for input and then automate the necessary tasks to greatly simplify otherwise burdensome processes.

### Automated Events

Users can define event rules to automatically trigger a custom script or outbound webhook in response to a NetBox event. For example, you might want to automatically update a network monitoring service whenever a new device is added to NetBox, or update a DHCP server when an IP range is allocated.

### Comprehensive Change Logging

NetBox automatically logs the creation, modification, and deletion of all managed objects, providing a thorough change history. Changes can be attributed to the executing user, and related changes are grouped automatically by request ID.

## Features
[Detailed feature showcase with images](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features):
- Original txt2img and img2img modes
- One click install and run script (but you still must install python and git)
- Outpainting
- Inpainting
- Color Sketch
- Prompt Matrix
- Stable Diffusion Upscale
- Attention, specify parts of text that the model should pay more attention to
    - a man in a `((tuxedo))` - will pay more attention to tuxedo
    - a man in a `(tuxedo:1.21)` - alternative syntax
    - select text and press `Ctrl+Up` or `Ctrl+Down` (or `Command+Up` or `Command+Down` if you&#039;re on a MacOS) to automatically adjust attention to selected text (code contributed by anonymous user)
- Loopback, run img2img processing multiple times
- X/Y/Z plot, a way to draw a 3 dimensional plot of images with different parameters
- Textual Inversion
    - have as many embeddings as you want and use any names you like for them
    - use multiple embeddings with different numbers of vectors per token
    - works with half precision floating point numbers
    - train embeddings on 8GB (also reports of 6GB working)
- Extras tab with:
    - GFPGAN, neural network that fixes faces
    - CodeFormer, face restoration tool as an alternative to GFPGAN
    - RealESRGAN, neural network upscaler
    - ESRGAN, neural network upscaler with a lot of third party models
    - SwinIR and Swin2SR ([see here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/2092)), neural network upscalers
    - LDSR, Latent diffusion super resolution upscaling
- Resizing aspect ratio options
- Sampling method selection
    - Adjust sampler eta values (noise multiplier)
    - More advanced noise setting options
- Interrupt processing at any time
- 4GB video card support (also reports of 2GB working)
- Correct seeds for batches
- Live prompt token length validation
- Generation parameters
     - parameters you used to generate images are saved with that image
     - in PNG chunks for PNG, in EXIF for JPEG
     - can drag the image to PNG info tab to restore generation parameters and automatically copy them into UI
     - can be disabled in settings
     - drag and drop an image/text-parameters to promptbox
- Read Generation Parameters Button, loads parameters in promptbox to UI
- Settings page
- Running arbitrary python code from UI (must run with `--allow-code` to enable)
- Mouseover hints for most UI elements
- Possible to change defaults/mix/max/step values for UI elements via text config
- Tiling support, a checkbox to create images that can be tiled like textures
- Progress bar and live image generation preview
    - Can use a separate neural network to produce previews with almost none VRAM or compute requirement
- Negative prompt, an extra text field that allows you to list what you don&#039;t want to see in generated image
- Styles, a way to save part of prompt and easily apply them via dropdown later
- Variations, a way to generate same image but with tiny differences
- Seed resizing, a way to generate same image but at slightly different resolution
- CLIP interrogator, a button that tries to guess prompt from an image
- Prompt Editing, a way to change prompt mid-generation, say to start making a watermelon and switch to anime girl midway

     - separate prompts using uppercase `AND`
     - also supports weights for prompts: `a cat :1.2 AND a dog AND a penguin :2.2`
- No token limit for prompts (original stable diffusion lets you use up to 75 tokens)
- DeepDanbooru integration, creates danbooru style tags for anime prompts
- [xformers](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Xformers), major speed increase for select cards: (add `--xformers` to commandline args)

     - Preprocessing images: cropping, mirroring, autotagging using BLIP or deepdanbooru (for anime)
- Clip skip
- Hypernetworks
- Loras (same as Hypernetworks but more pretty)
- A separate UI where you can choose, with preview, which embeddings, hypernetworks or Loras to add to your prompt
- Can select to load a different VAE from settings screen
- Estimated completion time in progress bar
- API
- Support for dedicated [inpainting model](https://github.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion#inpainting-with-stable-diffusion) by RunwayML
- via extension: [Aesthetic Gradients](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-aesthetic-gradients), a way to generate images with a specific aesthetic by using clip images embeds (implementation of [https://github.com/vicgalle/stable-diffusion-aesthetic-gradients](https://github.com/vicgalle/stable-diffusion-aesthetic-gradients))
- [Stable Diffusion 2.0](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) support - see [wiki](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features#stable-diffusion-20) for instructions
- [Alt-Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06679) support - see [wiki](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features#alt-diffusion) for instructions

🚩 This is the open source repository of NetExec maintained by a community of passionate people
# NetExec - The Network Execution Tool

This project was initially created in 2015 by @byt3bl33d3r, known as CrackMapExec. In 2019 @mpgn_x64 started maintaining the project for the next 4 years, adding a lot of great tools and features. In September 2023 he retired from maintaining the project.

Along with many other contributors, we (NeffIsBack, Marshall-Hallenbeck, and zblurx) developed new features, bug fixes, and helped maintain the original project CrackMapExec.
During this time, with both a private and public repository, community contributions were not easily merged into the project. The 6-8 month discrepancy between the code bases caused many development issues and heavily reduced community-driven development.
With the end of mpgn&#039;s maintainer role, we (the remaining most active contributors) decided to maintain the project together as a fully free and open source project under the new name **NetExec** 🚀
Going forward, our intent is to maintain a community-driven and maintained project with regular updates for everyone to use.

## UPDATE
You can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)

If you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program

For other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer to their documentation

&lt;a id=&quot;update-channels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.

* `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.
* The `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project&#039;s new patches and changes. This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip&#039;s `--pre` flag).
* The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).

When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.

You may also use `--update-to &lt;repository&gt;` (`&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.

Example usage:

* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release
* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`
* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel
* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`

**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:
```
# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly

# To install nightly with pip:
python3 -m pip install -U --pre &quot;yt-dlp[default]&quot;
```

## DEPENDENCIES
Python versions 3.9+ (CPython) and 3.10+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.

&lt;!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created
&lt;!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x&gt;
On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt;

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are highly recommended

### Strongly recommended

* [**ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**](https://www.ffmpeg.org) - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds

    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)

To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms.

The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with **\*** included.

If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the `--verbose` output


## COMPILE

### Standalone PyInstaller Builds
To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and `pyinstaller` (plus any of yt-dlp&#039;s [optional dependencies](#dependencies) if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used.

You can run the following commands:

```
python3 devscripts/install_deps.py --include pyinstaller
python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python3 -m bundle.pyinstaller
```

On some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`.

`python -m bundle.pyinstaller` accepts any arguments that can be passed to `pyinstaller`, such as `--onefile/-F` or `--onedir/-D`, which is further [documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate).

**Note**: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 [do not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.

**Important**: Running `pyinstaller` directly **instead of** using `python -m bundle.pyinstaller` is **not** officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.

### Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)
You will need the build tools `python` (3.9+), `zip`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`\* and `pytest`\*.

After installing these, simply run `make`.

You can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with **\*** are not needed for this)

### Related scripts

* **`devscripts/install_deps.py`** - Install dependencies for yt-dlp.
* **`devscripts/update-version.py`** - Update the version number based on the current date.
* **`devscripts/set-variant.py`** - Set the build variant of the executable.
* **`devscripts/make_changelog.py`** - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update `CONTRIBUTORS` file.
* **`devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`** - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable `YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS` to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading.

Note: See their `--help` for more info.

# Introduction

LTX-Video is the first DiT-based video generation model that can generate high-quality videos in *real-time*.
It can generate 30 FPS videos at 1216×704 resolution, faster than it takes to watch them.
The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of diverse videos and can generate high-resolution videos
with realistic and diverse content.

The model supports text-to-image, image-to-video, keyframe-based animation, video extension (both forward and backward), video-to-video transformations, and any combination of these features.

The woman with brown hair wears a black jacket and has a small, barely noticeable mole on her right cheek. The camera angle is a close-up, focused on the woman with brown hair&#039;s face. The lighting is warm and natural, likely from the setting sun, casting a soft glow on the scene. The scene appears to be real-life footage.&lt;/details&gt; | ![example10](./docs/_static/ltx-video_example_00010.gif)&lt;br&gt;&lt;details style=&quot;max-width: 300px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;A clear, turquoise river flows through a rocky canyon...&lt;/summary&gt;A clear, turquoise river flows through a rocky canyon, cascading over a small waterfall and forming a pool of water at the bottom.The river is the main focus of the scene, with its clear water reflecting the surrounding trees and rocks. The canyon walls are steep and rocky, with some vegetation growing on them. The trees are mostly pine trees, with their green needles contrasting with the brown and gray rocks. The overall tone of the scene is one of peace and tranquility.&lt;/details&gt; | ![example3](./docs/_static/ltx-video_example_00015.gif)&lt;br&gt;&lt;details style=&quot;max-width: 300px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Two police officers in dark blue uniforms and matching hats...&lt;/summary&gt;Two police officers in dark blue uniforms and matching hats enter a dimly lit room through a doorway on the left side of the frame. The first officer, with short brown hair and a mustache, steps inside first, followed by his partner, who has a shaved head and a goatee. Both officers have serious expressions and maintain a steady pace as they move deeper into the room. The camera remains stationary, capturing them from a slightly low angle as they enter. The room has exposed brick walls and a corrugated metal ceiling, with a barred window visible in the background. The lighting is low-key, casting shadows on the officers&#039; faces and emphasizing the grim atmosphere. The scene appears to be from a film or television show.&lt;/details&gt; |

He holds the black rotary phone to his right ear with his right hand, his left hand holding a rocks glass with amber liquid. He wears a brown suit jacket over a white shirt, and a gold ring on his left ring finger. His short hair is neatly combed, and he has light skin with visible wrinkles around his eyes. The camera remains stationary, focused on his face and upper body. The room is dark, lit only by a warm light source off-screen to the left, casting shadows on the wall behind him. The scene appears to be from a movie.&lt;/details&gt; | ![example7](./docs/_static/ltx-video_example_00007.gif)&lt;br&gt;&lt;details style=&quot;max-width: 300px; margin: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;A prison guard unlocks and opens a cell door...&lt;/summary&gt;A prison guard unlocks and opens a cell door to reveal a young man sitting at a table with a woman. The guard, wearing a dark blue uniform with a badge on his left chest, unlocks the cell door with a key held in his right hand and pulls it open; he has short brown hair, light skin, and a neutral expression. The young man, wearing a black and white striped shirt, sits at a table covered with a white tablecloth, facing the woman; he has short brown hair, light skin, and a neutral expression. The woman, wearing a dark blue shirt, sits opposite the young man, her face turned towards him; she has short blonde hair and light skin. The camera remains stationary, capturing the scene from a medium distance, positioned slightly to the right of the guard. The room is dimly lit, with a single light fixture illuminating the table and the two figures. The walls are made of large, grey concrete blocks, and a metal door is visible in the background. The scene is captured in real-life footage.&lt;/details&gt; |

He has short, dark hair, dark skin, and is wearing a brown coat over a red and gray scarf. He walks from left to right towards a window, his gaze fixed on something outside. The camera follows him from behind at a medium distance. The room is brightly lit, with white walls and a large window covered by a white curtain.

## Run locally

### Installation
The codebase was tested with Python 3.10.5, CUDA version 12.2, and supports PyTorch &gt;= 2.1.2.
On macos, MPS was tested with PyTorch 2.3.0, and should support PyTorch == 2.3 or &gt;= 2.6.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video.git
cd LTX-Video

# create env
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .\[inference-script\]
```

### Inference

📝 **Note:** For best results, we recommend using our [ComfyUI](#comfyui-integration) workflow. We’re working on updating the inference.py script to match the high quality and output fidelity of ComfyUI.

To use our model, please follow the inference code in [inference.py](./inference.py):

#### For text-to-video generation:

```bash
python inference.py --prompt &quot;PROMPT&quot; --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled.yaml
```

#### For image-to-video generation:

```bash
python inference.py --prompt &quot;PROMPT&quot; --conditioning_media_paths IMAGE_PATH --conditioning_start_frames 0 --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled.yaml
```

#### Extending a video:

📝 **Note:** Input video segments must contain a multiple of 8 frames plus 1 (e.g., 9, 17, 25, etc.), and the target frame number should be a multiple of 8.


```bash
python inference.py --prompt &quot;PROMPT&quot; --conditioning_media_paths VIDEO_PATH --conditioning_start_frames START_FRAME --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled.yaml
```

#### For video generation with multiple conditions:

You can now generate a video conditioned on a set of images and/or short video segments.
Simply provide a list of paths to the images or video segments you want to condition on, along with their target frame numbers in the generated video. You can also specify the conditioning strength for each item (default: 1.0).

```bash
python

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.

## More About PyTorch

[Learn the basics of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)

At a granular level, PyTorch is a library that consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| [**torch**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html) | A Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support |
| [**torch.autograd**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) | A tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch |
| [**torch.jit**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) | A compilation stack (TorchScript) to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code  |
| [**torch.nn**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) | A neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility |
| [**torch.multiprocessing**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html) | Python multiprocessing, but with magical memory sharing of torch Tensors across processes. Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |
| [**torch.utils**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |

Usually, PyTorch is used either as:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.
- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.

Elaborating Further:

### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library

If you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).

![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)

PyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the
computation by a huge amount.

We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs
such as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.
And they are fast!

### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd

PyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.

Most frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.
One has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.
Changing the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.

With PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to
change the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes
from several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as
[torch-autograd](https://github.com/twitter/torch-autograd),
[autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),
[Chainer](https://chainer.org), etc.

While this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it&#039;s one of the fastest implementations of it to date.
You get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.

![Dynamic graph](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/raw/main/docs/source/_static/img/dynamic_graph.gif)

### Python First

PyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.
It is built to be deeply integrated into Python.
You can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) / [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) etc.
You can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries
and use packages such as [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).
Our goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.

### Imperative Experiences

PyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.
When you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn&#039;t an asynchronous view of the world.
When you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.
The stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.
We hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.

### Fast and Lean

PyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries
such as [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) and NVIDIA ([cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)) to maximize speed.
At the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends
are mature and have been tested for years.

Hence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.

The memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.
We&#039;ve written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that
your deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.
This enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.

### Extensions Without Pain

Writing new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch&#039;s Tensor API was designed to be straightforward
and with minimal abstractions.

You can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API
[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).

If you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.
No wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).


## Installation

### Binaries
Commands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)


#### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms

Python wheels for NVIDIA&#039;s Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1/TX2, Jetson Xavier NX/AGX, and Jetson AGX Orin are provided [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson-version-1-10-now-available/72048) and the L4T container is published [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-pytorch)

They require JetPack 4.2 and above, and [@dusty-nv](https://github.com/dusty-nv) and [@ptrblck](https://github.com/ptrblck) are maintaining them.


### From Source

#### Prerequisites
If you are installing from source, you will need:
- Python 3.9 or later
- A compiler that fully supports C++17, such as clang or gcc (gcc 9.4.0 or newer is required, on Linux)
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tool (Windows only)

\* PyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,
Professional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools from
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. The build tools *do not*
come with Visual Studio Code by default.

An example of environment setup is shown below:

* Linux:

```bash
$ source &lt;CONDA_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/bin/activate
$ conda create -y -n &lt;CONDA_NAME&gt;
$ conda activate &lt;CONDA_NAME&gt;
```

* Windows:

```bash
$ source &lt;CONDA_INSTALL_DIR&gt;\Scripts\activate.bat
$ conda create -y -n &lt;CONDA_NAME&gt;
$ conda activate &lt;CONDA_NAME&gt;
$ call &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\&lt;VERSION&gt;\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat&quot; x64
```

##### NVIDIA CUDA Support
If you want to compile with CUDA support, [select a supported version of CUDA from our support matrix](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then install the following:
- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) v8.5 or above
- [Compiler](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) compatible with CUDA

Note: You could refer to the [cuDNN Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/backend/latest/reference/support-matrix.html) for cuDNN versions with the various supported CUDA, CUDA driver and NVIDIA hardware

If you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.
Other potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.

If you are building for NVIDIA&#039;s Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)

##### AMD ROCm Support
If you want to compile with ROCm support, install
- [AMD ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/quick_start.html) 4.0 and above installation
- ROCm is currently supported only for Linux systems.

By default the build system expects ROCm to be installed in `/opt/rocm`. If ROCm is installed in a different directory, the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable must be set to the ROCm installation directory. The build system automatically detects the AMD GPU architecture. Optionally, the AMD GPU architecture can be explicitly set with the `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` environment variable [AMD GPU architecture](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus)

If you want to disable ROCm support, export the environment variable `USE_ROCM=0`.
Other potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.

##### Intel GPU Support
If you want to compile with Intel GPU support, follow these
- [PyTorch Prerequisites for Intel GPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pytorch-prerequisites-for-intel-gpus.html) instructions.
- Intel GPU is supported for Linux and Windows.

If you want to disable Intel GPU support, export the environment variable `USE_XPU=0`.
Other potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.

#### Get the PyTorch Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch
# if you are updating an existing checkout
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Install Dependencies

**Common**

```bash
conda install cmake ninja
# Run this command from the PyTorch directory after cloning the source code using the “Get the PyTorch Source“ section below
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**On Linux**

```bash
pip install mkl-static mkl-include
# CUDA only: Add LAPACK support for the GPU if needed
# magma installation: run with active conda environment. specify CUDA version to install
.ci/docker/common/install_magma_conda.sh 12.4

# (optional) If using torch.compile with inductor/triton, install the matching version of triton
# Run from the pytorch directory after cloning
# For Intel GPU support, please explicitly `export USE_XPU=1` before running command.
make triton
```

**On MacOS**

```bash
# Add this package on intel x86 processor machines only
pip install mkl-static mkl-include
# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed
conda install pkg-config libuv
```

**On Windows**

```bash
pip install mkl-static mkl-include
# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed.
# Distributed package support on Windows is a prototype feature and is subject to changes.
conda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39
```

#### Install PyTorch
**On Linux**

If you&#039;re compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:
```bash
# Only run this if you&#039;re compiling for ROCm
python tools/amd_build/build_amd.py
```

Install PyTorch
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=&quot;${CONDA_PREFIX:-&#039;$(dirname $(which conda))/../&#039;}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}&quot;
python setup.py develop
```

**On macOS**

```bash
python3 setup.py develop
```

**On Windows**

If you want to build legacy python code, please refer to [Building on legacy code and CUDA](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-on-legacy-code-and-cuda)

**CPU-only builds**

In this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPU.

```cmd
python setup.py develop
```

Note on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you&#039;ll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIB`. The instruction [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/docs/source/notes/windows.rst#building-from-source) is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.

**CUDA based build**

In this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunching

[NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.
NVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called &quot;Nsight Compute&quot;. To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.
Make sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.

Currently, VS 2017 / 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 / 2019.
&lt;br/&gt; If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.

Additional libraries such as
[Magma](https://developer.nvidia.com/magma), [oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN), and [Sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) are often needed. Please refer to the [installation-helper](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/installation-helpers) to install them.

You can refer to the [build_pytorch.bat](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/build_pytorch.bat) script for some other environment variables configurations


```cmd
cmd

:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,
:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.
set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\mkl\include
set LIB={Your directory}\mkl\lib;%LIB%

:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.
:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.
:: &quot;Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt&quot; will be run automatically.
:: Make sure you have CMake &gt;= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.
set CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27
set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
for /f &quot;usebackq tokens=*&quot; %i in (`&quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe&quot; -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call &quot;%i\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat&quot; x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%

:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compiler
set CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.27.29110\bin\HostX64\x64\cl.exe

python setup.py develop

```

**Intel GPU builds**

In this mode PyTorch with Intel GPU support will be built.

Please make sure [the common prerequisites](#prerequisites) as well as [the prerequisites for Intel GPU](#intel-gpu-support) are properly installed and the environment variables are configured prior to starting the build. For build tool support, `Visual Studio 2022` is required.

Then PyTorch can be built with the command:

```cmd
:: CMD Commands:
:: Set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to help find corresponding packages
:: %CONDA_PREFIX% only works after `conda activate custom_env`

if defined CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (
    set &quot;CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%CONDA_PREFIX%\Library;%CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH%&quot;
) else (
    set &quot;CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%CONDA_PREFIX%\Library&quot;
)

python setup.py develop
```

##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)

You can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing
the following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done
with such a step.

On Linux
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=&quot;${CONDA_PREFIX:-&#039;$(dirname $(which conda))/../&#039;}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}&quot;
python setup.py build --cmake-only
ccmake build  # or cmake-gui build
```

On macOS
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=&quot;${CONDA_PREFIX:-&#039;$(dirname $(which conda))/../&#039;}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}&quot;
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only
ccmake build  # or cmake-gui build
```

### Docker Image

#### Using pre-built images

You can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest
```

Please note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.
for multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you
should increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.

#### Building the image yourself

**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version &gt; 18.06

The `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with CUDA 11.1 support and cuDNN v8.
You can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it
unset to use the default.

```bash
make -f docker.Makefile
# images are tagged as docker.io/${your_docker_username}/pytorch
```

You can also pass the `CMAKE_VARS=&quot;...&quot;` environment variable to specify additional CMake variables to be passed to CMake during the build.
See [setup.py](./setup.py) for the list of available variables.

```bash
make -f docker.Makefile
```

### Building the Documentation

To build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org)
and the pytorch_sphinx_theme2.

Before you build the documentation locally, ensure `torch` is
installed in your environment. For small fixes, you can install the
nightly version as described in [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

For more complex fixes, such as adding a new module and docstrings for
the new module, you might need to inst
