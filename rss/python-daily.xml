# Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1447831134212984903?color=5865F2&amp;label=discord&amp;labelColor=black&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/gdXc48gSyT) [![Follow us on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/follow-us-on-hf-md-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/heretic-org)

Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka &quot;safety alignment&quot;) from
transformer-based language models without expensive post-training.
It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known
as &quot;abliteration&quot; ([Arditi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717),
Lai 2025 ([1](https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/projected-abliteration),
[2](https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/norm-preserving-biprojected-abliteration))),
with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).

This approach enables Heretic to work **completely automatically.** Heretic
finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of
refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a
decensored model that retains as much of the original model&#039;s intelligence
as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer
internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program
can use Heretic to decensor language models.

&lt;img width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;715&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a5efa-d6be-4705-a817-63332afb2d15&quot; /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce
decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually
by human experts:

| Model | Refusals for &quot;harmful&quot; prompts | KL divergence from original model for &quot;harmless&quot; prompts |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| [google/gemma-3-12b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it) (original) | 97/100 | 0 *(by definition)* |
| [mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2) | 3/100 | 1.04 |
| [huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated](https://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated) | 3/100 | 0.45 |
| **[p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic) (ours)** | **3/100** | **0.16** |

The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same
level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower
KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model&#039;s capabilities.
*(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic&#039;s built-in evaluation functionality,
e.g. `heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic`.
Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent.
The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)*

Of course, mathematical metrics and automated benchmarks never tell the whole
story, and are no substitute for human evaluation. Models generated with
Heretic have been well-received by users (links and emphasis added):

&gt; &quot;I was skeptical before, but I just downloaded
&gt; [**GPT-OSS 20B Heretic**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic)
&gt; model and holy shit. It gives properly formatted long responses to sensitive topics,
&gt; using the exact uncensored words that you would expect from an uncensored model,
&gt; produces markdown format tables with details and whatnot. Looks like this is
&gt; the best abliterated version of this model so far...&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/np6tba6/)

&gt; &quot;[**Heretic GPT 20b**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic)
&gt; seems to be the best uncensored model I have tried yet. It doesn&#039;t destroy a
&gt; the model&#039;s intelligence and it is answering prompts normally would be
&gt; rejected by the base model.&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/npe9jng/)

&gt; &quot;[[**Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic**](https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic)]
&gt; Has been the best unquantized abliterated model that I have been able to run on 16gb vram.&quot;
&gt; [*(Link to comment)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1phjxca/im_calling_these_people_out_right_now/nt06tji/)

Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and
several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models,
models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.

You can find a small collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic
[on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary),
and the community has created and published
[well over 1,000](https://huggingface.co/models?other=heretic)
Heretic models in addition to those.


## Usage

Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate
for your hardware. Then run:

```
pip install -U heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
```

Replace `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` with whatever model you want to decensor.

The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however,
Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for
greater control. Run `heretic --help` to see available command-line options,
or look at [`config.default.toml`](config.default.toml) if you prefer to use
a configuration file.

At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine
the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware.
On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
takes about 45 minutes. Note that Heretic supports model quantization with
bitsandbytes, which can drastically reduce the amount of VRAM required to process
models. Set the `quantization` option to `bnb_4bit` to enable quantization.

After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to
save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works,
or any combination of those actions.


## Research features

In addition to its primary function of removing model censorship, Heretic also
provides features designed to support research into the semantics of model internals
(interpretability). To use those features, you need to install Heretic with the
optional `research` extra:

```
pip install -U heretic-llm[research]
```

This gives you access to the following functionality:

### Generate plots of residual vectors by passing `--plot-residuals`

When run with this flag, Heretic will:

1. Compute residual vectors (hidden states) for the first output token,
   for each transformer layer, for both &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; prompts.
2. Perform a [PaCMAP projection](https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP)
   from residual space to 2D-space.
3. Left-right align the projections of &quot;harmful&quot;/&quot;harmless&quot; residuals
   by their geometric medians to make projections for consecutive layers
   more similar. Additionally, PaCMAP is initialized with the previous
   layer&#039;s projections for each new layer, minimizing disruptive transitions.
4. Scatter-plot the projections, generating a PNG image for each layer.
5. Generate an animation showing how residuals transform between layers,
   as an animated GIF.

&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of residual vectors&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981aa6ed-5ab9-48f0-9abf-2b1a2c430295&quot; /&gt;

See [the configuration file](config.default.toml) for options that allow you
to control various aspects of the generated plots.

Note that PaCMAP is an expensive operation that is performed on the CPU.
For larger models, it can take an hour or more to compute projections
for all layers.

### Print details about residual geometry by passing `--print-residual-geometry`

If you are interested in a quantitative analysis of how residual vectors
for &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; prompts relate to each other, this flag gives you
the following table, packed with metrics that can facilitate understanding
the same (for [gemma-3-270m-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-270m-it)
in this case):

## How Heretic works

Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each
supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and
MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer
layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant &quot;refusal direction&quot;,
inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications
with that matrix.

Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between
the first-token residuals for &quot;harmful&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot; example prompts.

The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:

* `direction_index`: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special
  value `per layer`, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the
  refusal direction associated with that layer.
* `max_weight`, `max_weight_position`, `min_weight`, and `min_weight_distance`:
  For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the
  ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:

&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Explanation&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e4b84e-5a82-4faf-b918-ac642f9e4892&quot; /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Heretic&#039;s main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:

* The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with
  automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff.
  Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in
  [gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2).
* The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral
  values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated.
  This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified
  by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization
  process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.
* Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that
  MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions,
  so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.


## Prior art

I&#039;m aware of the following publicly available implementations of abliteration
techniques:

* [AutoAbliteration](https://huggingface.co/posts/mlabonne/714992455492422)
* [abliterator.py](https://github.com/FailSpy/abliterator)
* [wassname&#039;s Abliterator](https://github.com/wassname/abliterator)
* [ErisForge](https://github.com/Tsadoq/ErisForge)
* [Removing refusals with HF Transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers)
* [deccp](https://github.com/AUGMXNT/deccp)

Note that Heretic was written from scratch, and does not reuse code from
any of those projects.

Hummingbot is an open-source framework that helps you design and deploy automated trading strategies, or **bots**, that can run on many centralized or decentralized exchanges. Over the past year, Hummingbot users have generated over $34 billion in trading volume across 140+ unique trading venues.

The Hummingbot codebase is free and publicly available under the Apache 2.0 open-source license. Our mission is to **democratize high-frequency trading** by creating a global community of algorithmic traders and developers that share knowledge and contribute to the codebase.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Hummingbot is using Docker:

* To install the Telegram Bot [Condor](https://github.com/hummingbot/condor), follow the instructions in the [Hummingbot Docs](https://hummingbot.org/condor/installation/) site.

* To install the CLI-based Hummingbot client, follow the instructions below.

Alternatively, if you are building new connectors/strategies or adding custom code, see the [Install from Source](https://hummingbot.org/client/installation/#source-installation) section in the documentation.

### Install Hummingbot with Docker

Install [Docker Compose website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Clone the repo and use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot

# Run Setup &amp; Deploy
make setup
make deploy

# Attach to the running instance
docker attach hummingbot
```

### Install Hummingbot + Gateway DEX Middleware

Gateway provides standardized connectors for interacting with automatic market maker (AMM) decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across different blockchain networks.

To run Hummingbot with Gateway, clone the repo and answer `y` when prompted after running `make setup`

```yaml
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
```
```bash
make setup

# Answer `y` when prompted
Include Gateway? [y/N]
```

Then run:
```bash
make deploy

# Attach to the running instance
docker attach hummingbot
```

By default, Gateway will start in development mode with unencrypted HTTP endpoints. To run in production model with encrypted HTTPS, use the `DEV=false` flag and run `gateway generate-certs` in Hummingbot to generate the certificates needed. See [Development vs Production Modes](http://hummingbot.org/gateway/installation/#development-vs-production-modes) for more information.

## Exchange Connectors

Hummingbot connectors standardize REST and WebSocket API interfaces to different types of exchanges, enabling you to build sophisticated trading strategies that can be deployed across many exchanges with minimal changes.

### Connector Types

We classify exchange connectors into three main categories:

* **CLOB CEX**: Centralized exchanges with central limit order books that take custody of your funds. Connect via API keys.
  - **Spot**: Trading spot markets
  - **Perpetual**: Trading perpetual futures markets

* **CLOB DEX**: Decentralized exchanges with on-chain central limit order books. Non-custodial, connect via wallet keys.
  - **Spot**: Trading spot markets on-chain
  - **Perpetual**: Trading perpetual futures on-chain

* **AMM DEX**: Decentralized exchanges using Automated Market Maker protocols. Non-custodial, connect via Gateway middleware.
  - **Router**: DEX aggregators that find optimal swap routes
  - **AMM**: Traditional constant product (x*y=k) pools
  - **CLMM**: Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker pools with custom price ranges

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: A conversational AI agent that understands your requests and breaks down complex tasks.
- **Powerful Toolset**: A suite of tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution, right from the chat prompt.
  - Read, write, and patch files (`read_file`, `write_file`, `search_replace`).
  - Execute shell commands in a stateful terminal (`bash`).
  - Recursively search code with `grep` (with `ripgrep` support).
  - Manage a `todo` list to track the agent&#039;s work.
  - Ask interactive questions to gather user input (`ask_user_question`).
  - Delegate tasks to subagents for parallel work (`task`).
- **Project-Aware Context**: Vibe automatically scans your project&#039;s file structure and Git status to provide relevant context to the agent, improving its understanding of your codebase.
- **Advanced CLI Experience**: Built with modern libraries for a smooth and efficient workflow.
  - Autocompletion for slash commands (`/`) and file paths (`@`).
  - Persistent command history.
  - Beautiful Themes.
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize models, providers, tool permissions, and UI preferences through a simple `config.toml` file.
- **Safety First**: Features tool execution approval.
- **Multiple Built-in Agents**: Choose from different agent profiles tailored for specific workflows.

### Built-in Agents

Vibe comes with several built-in agent profiles, each designed for different use cases:

- **`default`**: Standard agent that requires approval for tool executions. Best for general use.
- **`plan`**: Read-only agent for exploration and planning. Auto-approves safe tools like `grep` and `read_file`.
- **`accept-edits`**: Auto-approves file edits only (`write_file`, `search_replace`). Useful for code refactoring.
- **`auto-approve`**: Auto-approves all tool executions. Use with caution.

Use the `--agent` flag to select a different agent:

```bash
vibe --agent plan
```

### Subagents and Task Delegation

Vibe supports subagents for delegating tasks. Subagents run independently and can perform specialized work without user interaction, preventing the context from being overloaded.

The `task` tool allows the agent to delegate work to subagents:

```
&gt; Can you explore the codebase structure while I work on something else?

🤖 I&#039;ll use the task tool to delegate this to the explore subagent.

&gt; task(task=&quot;Analyze the project structure and architecture&quot;, agent=&quot;explore&quot;)
```

Create custom subagents by adding `agent_type = &quot;subagent&quot;` to your agent configuration. Vibe comes with a built-in subagent called `explore`, a read-only subagent for codebase exploration used internally for delegation.

### Interactive User Questions

The `ask_user_question` tool allows the agent to ask you clarifying questions during its work. This enables more interactive and collaborative workflows.

```
&gt; Can you help me refactor this function?

🤖 I need to understand your requirements better before proceeding.

&gt; ask_user_question(questions=[{
    &quot;question&quot;: &quot;What&#039;s the main goal of this refactoring?&quot;,
    &quot;options&quot;: [
        {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Performance&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Make it run faster&quot;},
        {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Readability&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Make it easier to understand&quot;},
        {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Maintainability&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Make it easier to modify&quot;}
    ]
}])
```

The agent can ask multiple questions at once, displayed as tabs. Each question supports 2-4 options plus an automatic &quot;Other&quot; option for free text responses.

## Terminal Requirements

Vibe&#039;s interactive interface requires a modern terminal emulator. Recommended terminal emulators include:

- **WezTerm** (cross-platform)
- **Alacritty** (cross-platform)
- **Ghostty** (Linux and macOS)
- **Kitty** (Linux and macOS)

Most modern terminals should work, but older or minimal terminal emulators may have display issues.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to your project&#039;s root directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Run Vibe:

   ```bash
   vibe
   ```

3. If this is your first time running Vibe, it will:

   - Create a default configuration file at `~/.vibe/config.toml`
   - Prompt you to enter your API key if it&#039;s not already configured
   - Save your API key to `~/.vibe/.env` for future use

   Alternatively, you can configure your API key separately using `vibe --setup`.

4. Start interacting with the agent!

   ```
   &gt; Can you find all instances of the word &quot;TODO&quot; in the project?

   🤖 The user wants to find all instances of &quot;TODO&quot;. The `grep` tool is perfect for this. I will use it to search the current directory.

   &gt; grep(pattern=&quot;TODO&quot;, path=&quot;.&quot;)

   ... (grep tool output) ...

   🤖 I found the following &quot;TODO&quot; comments in your project.
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `vibe` to enter the interactive chat loop.

- **Multi-line Input**: Press `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` for select terminals to insert a newline.
- **File Paths**: Reference files in your prompt using the `@` symbol for smart autocompletion (e.g., `&gt; Read the file @src/agent.py`).
- **Shell Commands**: Prefix any command with `!` to execute it directly in your shell, bypassing the agent (e.g., `&gt; !ls -l`).
- **External Editor**: Press `Ctrl+G` to edit your current input in an external editor.
- **Tool Output Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle the tool output view.
- **Todo View Toggle**: Press `Ctrl+T` to toggle the todo list view.
- **Auto-Approve Toggle**: Press `Shift+Tab` to toggle auto-approve mode on/off.

You can start Vibe with a prompt using the following command:

```bash
vibe &quot;Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular.&quot;
```

**Note**: The `--auto-approve` flag automatically approves all tool executions without prompting. In interactive mode, you can also toggle auto-approve on/off using `Shift+Tab`.

### Trust Folder System

Vibe includes a trust folder system to ensure you only run the agent in directories you trust. When you first run Vibe in a new directory which contains a `.vibe` subfolder, it may ask you to confirm whether you trust the folder.

Trusted folders are remembered for future sessions. You can manage trusted folders through its configuration file `~/.vibe/trusted_folders.toml`.

This safety feature helps prevent accidental execution in sensitive directories.

### Programmatic Mode

You can run Vibe non-interactively by piping input or using the `--prompt` flag. This is useful for scripting.

```bash
vibe --prompt &quot;Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular.&quot;
```

By default, it uses `auto-approve` mode.

#### Programmatic Mode Options

When using `--prompt`, you can specify additional options:

- **`--max-turns N`**: Limit the maximum number of assistant turns. The session will stop after N turns.
- **`--max-price DOLLARS`**: Set a maximum cost limit in dollars. The session will be interrupted if the cost exceeds this limit.
- **`--enabled-tools TOOL`**: Enable specific tools. In programmatic mode, this disables all other tools. Can be specified multiple times. Supports exact names, glob patterns (e.g., `bash*`), or regex with `re:` prefix (e.g., `re:^serena_.*$`).
- **`--output FORMAT`**: Set the output format. Options:
  - `text` (default): Human-readable text output
  - `json`: All messages as JSON at the end
  - `streaming`: Newline-delimited JSON per message

Example:

```bash
vibe --prompt &quot;Analyze the codebase&quot; --max-turns 5 --max-price 1.0 --output json
```

## Slash Commands

Use slash commands for meta-actions and configuration changes during a session.

### Built-in Slash Commands

Vibe provides several built-in slash commands. Use slash commands by typing them in the input box:

```
&gt; /help
```

### Custom Slash Commands via Skills

You can define your own slash commands through the skills system. Skills are reusable components that extend Vibe&#039;s functionality.

To create a custom slash command:

1. Create a skill directory with a `SKILL.md` file
2. Set `user-invocable = true` in the skill metadata
3. Define the command logic in your skill

Example skill metadata:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: My custom skill with slash commands
user-invocable: true
---
```

Custom slash commands appear in the autocompletion menu alongside built-in commands.

## Skills System

Vibe&#039;s skills system allows you to extend functionality through reusable components. Skills can add new tools, slash commands, and specialized behaviors.

Vibe follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for skill format and structure.

### Creating Skills

Skills are defined in directories with a `SKILL.md` file containing metadata in YAML frontmatter. For example, `~/.vibe/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Perform automated code reviews
license: MIT
compatibility: Python 3.12+
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools:
  - read_file
  - grep
  - ask_user_question
---

# Code Review Skill

This skill helps analyze code quality and suggest improvements.
```

### Skill Discovery

Vibe discovers skills from multiple locations:

1. **Custom paths**: Configured in `config.toml` via `skill_paths`
2. **Standard Agent Skills path** (project root, trusted folders only): `.agents/skills/` — [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard
3. **Local project skills** (project root, trusted folders only): `.vibe/skills/` in your project
4. **Global skills directory**: `~/.vibe/skills/`

```toml
skill_paths = [&quot;/path/to/custom/skills&quot;]
```

### Managing Skills

Enable or disable skills using patterns in your configuration:

```toml
# Enable specific skills
enabled_skills = [&quot;code-review&quot;, &quot;test-*&quot;]

# Disable specific skills
disabled_skills = [&quot;experimental-*&quot;]
```

Skills support the same pattern matching as tools (exact names, glob patterns, and regex).

## Configuration

### Configuration File Location

Vibe is configured via a `config.toml` file. It looks for this file first in `./.vibe/config.toml` and then falls back to `~/.vibe/config.toml`.

### API Key Configuration

To use Vibe, you&#039;ll need a Mistral API key. You can obtain one by signing up at [https://console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai).

You can configure your API key using `vibe --setup`, or through one of the methods below.

Vibe supports multiple ways to configure your API keys:

1. **Interactive Setup (Recommended for first-time users)**: When you run Vibe for the first time or if your API key is missing, Vibe will prompt you to enter it. The key will be securely saved to `~/.vibe/.env` for future sessions.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set your API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY=&quot;your_mistral_api_key&quot;
   ```

3. **`.env` File**: Create a `.env` file in `~/.vibe/` and add your API keys:

   ```bash
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
   ```

   Vibe automatically loads API keys from `~/.vibe/.env` on startup. Environment variables take precedence over the `.env` file if both are set.

**Note**: The `.env` file is specifically for API keys and other provider credentials. General Vibe configuration should be done in `config.toml`.

### Custom System Prompts

You can create custom system prompts to replace the default one (`prompts/cli.md`). Create a markdown file in the `~/.vibe/prompts/` directory with your custom prompt content.

To use a custom system prompt, set the `system_prompt_id` in your configuration to match the filename (without the `.md` extension):

```toml
# Use a custom system prompt
system_prompt_id = &quot;my_custom_prompt&quot;
```

This will load the prompt from `~/.vibe/prompts/my_custom_prompt.md`.

### Custom Agent Configurations

You can create custom agent configurations for specific use cases (e.g., red-teaming, specialized tasks) by adding agent-specific TOML files in the `~/.vibe/agents/` directory.

To use a custom agent, run Vibe with the `--agent` flag:

```bash
vibe --agent my_custom_agent
```

Vibe will look for a file named `my_custom_agent.toml` in the agents directory and apply its configuration.

Example custom agent configuration (`~/.vibe/agents/redteam.toml`):

```toml
# Custom agent configuration for red-teaming
active_model = &quot;devstral-2&quot;
system_prompt_id = &quot;redteam&quot;

# Disable some tools for this agent
disabled_tools = [&quot;search_replace&quot;, &quot;write_file&quot;]

# Override tool permissions for this agent
[tools.bash]
permission = &quot;always&quot;

[tools.read_file]
permission = &quot;always&quot;
```

Note: This implies that you have set up a redteam prompt named `~/.vibe/prompts/redteam.md`.

### Tool Management

#### Enable/Disable Tools with Patterns

You can control which tools are active using `enabled_tools` and `disabled_tools`.
These fields support exact names, glob patterns, and regular expressions.

Examples:

```toml
# Only enable tools that start with &quot;serena_&quot; (glob)
enabled_tools = [&quot;serena_*&quot;]

# Regex (prefix with re:) — matches full tool name (case-insensitive)
enabled_tools = [&quot;re:^serena_.*$&quot;]

# Disable a group with glob; everything else stays enabled
disabled_tools = [&quot;mcp_*&quot;, &quot;grep&quot;]
```

Notes:

- MCP tool names use underscores, e.g., `serena_list` not `serena.list`.
- Regex patterns are matched against the full tool name using fullmatch.

### MCP Server Configuration

You can configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend Vibe&#039;s capabilities. Add MCP server configurations under the `mcp_servers` section:

```toml
# Example MCP server configurations
[[mcp_servers]]
name = &quot;my_http_server&quot;
transport = &quot;http&quot;
url = &quot;http://localhost:8000&quot;
headers = { &quot;Authorization&quot; = &quot;Bearer my_token&quot; }
api_key_env = &quot;MY_API_KEY_ENV_VAR&quot;
api_key_header = &quot;Authorization&quot;
api_key_format = &quot;Bearer {token}&quot;

[[mcp_servers]]
name = &quot;my_streamable_server&quot;
transport = &quot;streamable-http&quot;
url = &quot;http://localhost:8001&quot;
headers = { &quot;X-API-Key&quot; = &quot;my_api_key&quot; }

[[mcp_servers]]
name = &quot;fetch_server&quot;
transport = &quot;stdio&quot;
command = &quot;uvx&quot;
args = [&quot;mcp-server-fetch&quot;]
env = { &quot;DEBUG&quot; = &quot;1&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot; = &quot;info&quot; }
```

Supported transports:

- `http`: Standard HTTP transport
- `streamable-http`: HTTP transport with streaming support
- `stdio`: Standard input/output transport (for local processes)

Key fields:

- `name`: A short alias for the server (used in tool names)
- `transport`: The transport type
- `url`: Base URL for HTTP transports
- `headers`: Additional HTTP headers
- `api_key_env`: Environment variable containing the API key
- `command`: Command to run for stdio transport
- `args`: Additional arguments for stdio transport
- `startup_timeout_sec`: Timeout in seconds for the server to start and initialize (default 10s)
- `tool_timeout_sec`: Timeout in seconds for tool execution (default 60s)
- `env`: Environment variables to set for the MCP server of transport type stdio

MCP tools are named using the pattern `{server_name}_{tool_name}` and can be configured with permissions like built-in tools:

```toml
# Configure permissions for specific MCP tools
[tools.fetch_server_get]
permission = &quot;always&quot;

[tools.my_http_server_query]
permission = &quot;ask&quot;
```

MCP server configurations support additional features:

- **Environment variables**: Set environment variables for MCP servers
- **Custom timeouts**: Configure startup and tool execution timeouts

Example with environment variables and timeouts:

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name = &quot;my_server&quot;
transport = &quot;http&quot;
url = &quot;http://localhost:8000&quot;
env = { &quot;DEBUG&quot; = &quot;1&quot;, &quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot; = &quot;info&quot; }
startup_timeout_sec = 15
tool_timeout_sec = 120
```

### Session Management

#### Session Continuation and Resumption

Vibe supports continuing from previous sessions:

- **`--continue`** or **`-c`**: Continue from the most recent saved session
- **`--resume SESSION_ID`**: Resume a specific session by ID (supports partial matching)

```bash
# Continue from last session
vibe --continue

# Resume specific session
vibe --resume abc123
```

Session logging must be enabled in your configuration for these features to work.

#### Working Directory Control

Use the `--workdir` option to specify a working directory:

```bash
vibe --workdir /path/to/project
```

This is useful when you want to run Vibe from a different location than your current directory.

### Update Settings

#### Auto-Update

Vibe includes an automatic update feature that keeps your installation current. This is enabled by default.

To disable auto-updates, add this to your `config.toml`:

```toml
enable_auto_update = false
```

### Custom Vibe Home Directory

By default, Vibe stores its configuration in `~/.vibe/`. You can override this by setting the `VIBE_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
export VIBE_HOME=&quot;/path/to/custom/vibe/home&quot;
```

This affects where Vibe looks for:

- `config.toml` - Main configuration
- `.env` - API keys
- `agents/` - Custom agent configurations
- `prompts/` - Custom system prompts
- `tools/` - Custom tools
- `logs/` - Session logs

## Editors/IDEs

Mistral Vibe can be used in text editors and IDEs that support [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/clients). See the [ACP

Overview
---

Nemo AutoModel is a Pytorch DTensor‑native SPMD open-source training library under [NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo), designed to streamline and scale training and finetuning for LLMs and VLMs. Designed for flexibility, reproducibility, and scale, NeMo AutoModel enables both small-scale experiments and massive multi-GPU, multi-node deployments for fast experimentation in research and production environments.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: light)&quot; srcset=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/refs/heads/main/docs/automodel_diagram.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;AutoModel Logo&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/refs/heads/main/docs/automodel_diagram.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


What you can expect:

- **Hackable** with a modular design that allows easy integration, customization and quick research prototypes.
- **Minimal ceremony**: YAML‑driven recipes; override any field via CLI.
- **High performance and flexibility** with custom kernels and DTensor support.
- **Seamless integration** with Hugging Face for day-0 model support, ease of use, and wide range of supported models.
- **Efficient resource management** using k8s and Slurm, enabling scalable and flexible deployment across configurations.
- **Comprehensive documentation** that is both detailed and user-friendly, with practical examples.

&lt;!-- Please refer to our design documents for more details on the architecture and design philosophy. --&gt;

&lt;!-- NeMo Framework is NVIDIA&#039;s GPU accelerated, end-to-end training framework for large language models (LLMs), multi-modal models and speech models. It enables seamless scaling of training (both pretraining and post-training) workloads from single GPU to thousand-node clusters for both 🤗Hugging Face/PyTorch and Megatron models. It includes a suite of libraries and recipe collections to help users train models from end to end. The **AutoModel library (&quot;NeMo AutoModel&quot;)** provides GPU-accelerated PyTorch training for 🤗Hugging Face models on **Day-0**. Users can start training and fine-tuning models instantly without conversion delays, scale effortlessly with PyTorch-native parallelisms, optimized custom kernels, and memory-efficient recipes-all while preserving the original checkpoint format for seamless use across the Hugging Face ecosystem. --&gt;

&gt; ⚠️ Note: NeMo AutoModel is under active development. New features, improvements, and documentation updates are released regularly. We are working toward a stable release, so expect the interface to solidify over time. Your feedback and contributions are welcome, and we encourage you to follow along as new updates roll out.

### Why PyTorch Distributed and SPMD

- **One program, any scale**: The same training script runs on 1 GPU or 1000+ by changing the mesh.
- **PyTorch Distributed native**: Partition model/optimizer states with `DeviceMesh` + placements (`Shard`, `Replicate`).
- **SPMD first**: Parallelism is configuration. No model rewrites when scaling up or changing strategy.
- **Decoupled concerns**: Model code stays pure PyTorch; parallel strategy lives in config.
- **Composability**: Mix **tensor**, **sequence**, and **data** parallel by editing placements.
- **Portability**: Fewer bespoke abstractions; easier to reason about failure modes and restarts.
&lt;!-- - **Interoperability**: HF models/tokenizers/optimizers plug in directly; no format round‑trips. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Key Features --&gt;

&lt;!-- - **Mesh‑defined parallelism**: Compose tensor/sequence/pipeline/data parallel by changing placements and sizes. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - **FSDP2 on DTensor**: Memory‑efficient sharding (HSDP included) for large scale training. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - **Pretraining, SFT &amp; PEFT**: Day‑0 support for LLMs both regimes with shared configs/utilities.
- **Mixed precision**: BF16/FP16/FP8; sequence packing; optimized CUDA kernels. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - **Mesh‑aware DCP**: Sharded SafeTensors with merge/reshard utilities; interoperable with HF. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - **Large-Scale Distributed Training**: Built-in FSDP2 and Megatron-FSDP for seamless multi-node scaling. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - **Vision-Language Model Ready**: Native support for VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Gemma-3-VL, etc). --&gt;
&lt;!-- - **Day-0 Hugging Face Support**: Instantly fine-tune any model from the Hugging Face Hub. --&gt;

## Getting Started

We recommend using **uv** for reproducible Python environments.

```bash
# Setup environment before running any commands
uv venv
uv sync --frozen --all-extras

uv pip install nemo_automodel # latest release
# or: uv pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel.git
uv run python -c &quot;import nemo_automodel; print(&#039;AutoModel ready&#039;)&quot;
```


### Run a Recipe
To run a NeMo AutoModel recipe, you need a recipe script (e.g., [LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py), [VLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/examples/vlm_finetune/finetune.py)) and a YAML config file (e.g., [LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/examples/llm_finetune/llama/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml), [VLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/examples/vlm_finetune/gemma3/gemma3_vl_4b_cord_v2_peft.yaml)):
```
# Command invocation format:
uv run &lt;recipe_script_path&gt; --config &lt;yaml_config_path&gt;

# LLM example: multi-GPU with FSDP2
uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py --config examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_hellaswag.yaml

# VLM example: single GPU fine-tuning (Gemma-3-VL) with LoRA
uv run examples/vlm_finetune/finetune.py --config examples/vlm_finetune/gemma3/gemma3_vl_4b_cord_v2_peft.yaml
```


## LLM Pre-training
### LLM Pre-training Single Node
We provide an example SFT experiment using the [Fineweb dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17557/) with a nano-GPT model, ideal for quick experimentation on a single node.
```sh
uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 \
  examples/llm_pretrain/pretrain.py \
  -c examples/llm_pretrain/nanogpt_pretrain.yaml
```

&lt;!-- ### LLM Pre-training Multi Node --&gt;

## LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
We provide an example SFT experiment using the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).

&lt;!-- Refer to `examples/llm_finetune/annotated.yaml` for a full list of parameters that can be overridden. --&gt;

### LLM SFT Single Node

The default SFT configuration is set to run on a single GPU. To start the experiment:

```sh
uv run python3 \
  examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \
  -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml
```

This fine-tunes the `Llama3.2-1B` model on the SQuAD dataset using a 1 GPU.

To use multiple GPUs on a single node in an interactive environment, you can run the same command
using torchrun and adjust the `--proc-per-node` argument to the number of needed GPUs.

```sh
uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 \
  examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \
  -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can use the `automodel` CLI application to launch the same job, for example:
```sh
uv run automodel finetune llm \
  --nproc-per-node=8 \
  -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml
```

### LLM SFT Multi Node
You can use the `automodel` CLI application to launch a job on a SLURM cluster, for example:
```sh
# First you need to specify the SLURM section in your YAML config, for example:

cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml
slurm:
  job_name: llm-finetune # set to the job name you want to use
  nodes: 2 # set to the needed number of nodes
  ntasks_per_node: 8
  time: 00:30:00
  account: your_account
  partition: gpu
  container_image: nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.07
  gpus_per_node: 8 # This adds &quot;#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8&quot; to the script
  # Optional: Add extra mount points if needed
  extra_mounts:
    - /lustre:/lustre
  # Optional: Specify custom HF_HOME location (will auto-create if not specified)
  hf_home: /path/to/your/HF_HOME
  # Optional : Specify custom env vars
  # env_vars:
  #   ENV_VAR: value
  # Optional: Specify custom job directory (defaults to cwd/slurm_jobs)
  # job_dir: /path/to/slurm/jobs
EOF

# using the updated YAML you can launch the job.
uv run automodel finetune llm \
  -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml
```

## LLM Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

We provide a PEFT example using the [HellaSwag dataset](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/).

### LLM PEFT Single Node
```bash
# Memory‑efficient SFT with LoRA
uv run examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \
--config examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_hellaswag_peft.yaml

# You can always overwrite parameters by appending them to the command, for example,
# if you want to increase the micro-batch size you can do
uv run examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \
  --config examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_hellaswag_peft.yaml \
  --step_scheduler.local_batch_size 16

# The above command will modify the `local_batch_size` variable to have value 16 in the
# section `step_scheduler` of the yaml file.
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Launching a multi-node PEFT example requires only adding a `slurm` section to your config, similarly to the SFT case.


## VLM Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

We provide a VLM SFT example using Qwen2.5‑VL for end‑to‑end fine‑tuning on image‑text data.

### VLM SFT Single Node
```bash
# Qwen2.5‑VL on a 8 GPUs
uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 \
  examples/vlm_finetune/finetune.py \
  --config examples/vlm_finetune/qwen2_5/qwen2_5_vl_3b_rdr.yaml
```

## VLM Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

We provide a VLM PEFT (LoRA) example for memory‑efficient adaptation with Gemma3 VLM.

### VLM PEFT Single Node
```bash
# Qwen2.5‑VL on a 8 GPUs
uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 \
  examples/vlm_finetune/finetune.py \
  --config examples/vlm_finetune/gemma3/gemma3_vl_4b_medpix_peft.yaml
```

            <h2>README</h2><pre>#  InferenceX™, Open Source Inference Frequent Benchmarking

InferenceX™ (formerly InferenceMAX) runs our suite of benchmarks every night, continually re-benchmarking the world’s most popular open-source inference frameworks used by major token factories and models to track real performance in real time. As these software stacks improve, InferenceX™ captures that progress in near real-time, providing a live indicator of inference performance progress. A live dashboard is available for free publicly at https://inferencex.com/. 

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Only [SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX) repo contains the Official InferenceX™ result, all other forks &amp; repos are Unofficial. The benchmark setup &amp; quality of machines/clouds in unofficial repos may be differ leading to subpar benchmarking. Unofficial must be explicitly labelled as Unofficial.
&gt; Forks may not remove this disclaimer

&lt;img width=&quot;1627&quot; height=&quot;1022&quot; alt=&quot;CleanShot 2026-02-04 at 15 26 09&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65110e16-7590-424f-884d-12876d9e8f3e&quot; /&gt;


## Why?

InferenceX™, an open-source, under Apache2 license, automated benchmark designed to move at the same rapid speed as the software ecosystem itself, is built to address this challenge.

LLM Inference performance is driven by two pillars, hardware and software. While hardware innovation drives step jumps in performance every year through the release of new GPUs/XPUs and new systems, software evolves every single day, delivering continuous performance gains on top of these step jumps. Speed is the Moat 🚀
 
AI software like SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, CUDA, ROCm and achieve this continuous improvement in performance through kernel-level optimizations, distributed inference strategies, and scheduling innovations that increase the pareto frontier of performance in incremental releases that can be just days apart.
 
This pace of software advancement creates a challenge: benchmarks conducted at a fixed point in time quickly go stale and do not represent the performance that can be achieved with the latest software packages.


## Acknowledgements &amp; Supporters
Thank you to Lisa Su and Anush Elangovan for providing the MI355X and CDNA3 GPUs for this free and open-source project. We want to recognize the many AMD contributors for their responsiveness and for debugging, optimizing, and validating performance across AMD GPUs. 
We’re also grateful to Jensen Huang and Ian Buck for supporting this open source with access to a GB200 NVL72 rack (through OCI) and B200 GPUs. Thank you to the many NVIDIA contributors from the NVIDIA inference team, NVIDIA Dynamo team.

We also want to recognize the SGLang, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM maintainers for building a world-class software stack and open sourcing it to the entire world.
Finally, we’re grateful to Crusoe, CoreWeave, Nebius, TensorWave, Oracle and TogetherAI for supporting open-source innovation through compute resources, enabling this.

&quot;As we build systems at unprecedented scale, it&#039;s critical for the ML community to have open, transparent benchmarks that reflect how inference really performs across hardware and software. InferenceX™&#039;s head-to-head benchmarks cut through the noise and provide a living picture of token throughput, performance per dollar, and tokens per Megawatt. This kind of open source effort strengthens the entire ecosystem and helps everyone, from researchers to operators of frontier datacenters, make smarter decisions.&quot; - Peter Hoeschele, VP of Infrastructure and Industrial Compute, OpenAI Stargate

&quot;The gap between theoretical peak and real-world inference throughput is often determined by systems software: inference engine, distributed strategies, and low-level kernels. InferenceX™ is valuable because it benchmarks the latest software showing how optimizations actually play out across various hardware. Open, reproducible results like these help the whole community move faster.” - Tri Dao, Chief Scientist of Together AI &amp; Inventor of Flash Attention

“The industry needs many public, reproducible benchmarks of inference performance. We’re excited to collaborate with InferenceX™ from the vLLM team. More diverse workloads and scenarios that everyone can trust and reference will help the ecosystem move forward. Fair, transparent measurements drive progress across every layer of the stack, from model architectures to inference engines to hardware.” – Simon Mo, vLLM Project Co-Lead

## Quickstart

### Basic Agent - Python

Create a simple Azure Responses Agent that writes a haiku about the Microsoft Agent Framework

```python
# pip install agent-framework --pre
# Use `az login` to authenticate with Azure CLI
import os
import asyncio
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIResponsesClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential


async def main():
    # Initialize a chat agent with Azure OpenAI Responses
    # the endpoint, deployment name, and api version can be set via environment variables
    # or they can be passed in directly to the AzureOpenAIResponsesClient constructor
    agent = AzureOpenAIResponsesClient(
        # endpoint=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT&quot;],
        # deployment_name=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_RESPONSES_DEPLOYMENT_NAME&quot;],
        # api_version=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION&quot;],
        # api_key=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;],  # Optional if using AzureCliCredential
        credential=AzureCliCredential(), # Optional, if using api_key
    ).as_agent(
        name=&quot;HaikuBot&quot;,
        instructions=&quot;You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.&quot;,
    )

    print(await agent.run(&quot;Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.&quot;))

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Basic Agent - .NET

Create a simple Agent, using OpenAI Responses, that writes a haiku about the Microsoft Agent Framework

```c#
// dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
using System;
using OpenAI;

// Replace the &lt;apikey&gt; with your OpenAI API key.
var agent = new OpenAIClient(&quot;&lt;apikey&gt;&quot;)
    .GetOpenAIResponseClient(&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;)
    .AsAIAgent(name: &quot;HaikuBot&quot;, instructions: &quot;You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.&quot;);

Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync(&quot;Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.&quot;));
```

Create a simple Agent, using Azure OpenAI Responses with token based auth, that writes a haiku about the Microsoft Agent Framework

```c#
// dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
// dotnet add package Azure.Identity
// Use `az login` to authenticate with Azure CLI
using System;
using OpenAI;

// Replace &lt;resource&gt; and gpt-4o-mini with your Azure OpenAI resource name and deployment name.
var agent = new OpenAIClient(
    new BearerTokenPolicy(new AzureCliCredential(), &quot;https://ai.azure.com/.default&quot;),
    new OpenAIClientOptions() { Endpoint = new Uri(&quot;https://&lt;resource&gt;.openai.azure.com/openai/v1&quot;) })
    .GetOpenAIResponseClient(&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;)
    .AsAIAgent(name: &quot;HaikuBot&quot;, instructions: &quot;You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.&quot;);

## Important Notes

If you use the Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization&#039;s Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.

|     +----------------------------------------------------------------+     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### For end users

- **Clean &amp; Minimalistic UI**: A user-friendly interface for RAG-based QA.
- **Support for Various LLMs**: Compatible with LLM API providers (OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Cohere, etc.) and local LLMs (via `ollama` and `llama-cpp-python`).
- **Easy Installation**: Simple scripts to get you started quickly.

### For developers

- **Framework for RAG Pipelines**: Tools to build your own RAG-based document QA pipeline.
- **Customizable UI**: See your RAG pipeline in action with the provided UI, built with &lt;a href=&#039;https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;Gradio &lt;img src=&#039;https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio&#039;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
- **Gradio Theme**: If you use Gradio for development, check out our theme here: [kotaemon-gradio-theme](https://github.com/lone17/kotaemon-gradio-theme).

## Key Features

- **Host your own document QA (RAG) web-UI**: Support multi-user login, organize your files in private/public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others.

- **Organize your LLM &amp; Embedding models**: Support both local LLMs &amp; popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq).

- **Hybrid RAG pipeline**: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text &amp; vector) retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality.

- **Multi-modal QA support**: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI).

- **Advanced citations with document preview**: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the _in-browser PDF viewer_ with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles.

- **Support complex reasoning methods**: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with `ReAct`, `ReWOO` and other agents.

- **Configurable settings UI**: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval &amp; generation process on the UI (incl. prompts).

- **Extensible**: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing &amp; retrieval. `GraphRAG` indexing pipeline is provided as an example.

## Installation

&gt; If you are not a developer and just want to use the app, please check out our easy-to-follow [User Guide](https://cinnamon.github.io/kotaemon/). Download the `.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/releases/latest) to get all the newest features and bug fixes.

### System requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) &gt;= 3.10
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): optional, if you [install with Docker](#with-docker-recommended)
3. [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation#full-installation) if you want to process files other than `.pdf`, `.html`, `.mhtml`, and `.xlsx` documents. Installation steps differ depending on your operating system. Please visit the link and follow the specific instructions provided there.

### With Docker (recommended)

1. We support both `lite` &amp; `full` version of Docker images. With `full` version, the extra packages of `unstructured` will be installed, which can support additional file types (`.doc`, `.docx`, ...) but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the `lite` image should work well in most cases.

   - To use the `full` version.

     ```bash
     docker run \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
     -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
     -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
     -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
     ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-full
     ```

   - To use the `full` version with bundled **Ollama** for _local / private RAG_.

     ```bash
     # change image name to
     docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-ollama
     ```

   - To use the `lite` version.

   ```bash
    # change image name to
    docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

2. We currently support and test two platforms: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (for newer Mac). You can specify the platform by passing `--platform` in the `docker run` command. For example:

   ```bash
   # To run docker with platform linux/arm64
   docker run \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
   -e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
   -v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
   -p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
   --platform linux/arm64 \
   ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite
   ```

3. Once everything is set up correctly, you can go to `http://localhost:7860/` to access the WebUI.

4. We use [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store docker images, all images can be found [here.](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/pkgs/container/kotaemon)

### Without Docker

1. Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment.

   ```shell
   # optional (setup env)
   conda create -n kotaemon python=3.10
   conda activate kotaemon

   # clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon
   cd kotaemon

   pip install -e &quot;libs/kotaemon[all]&quot;
   pip install -e &quot;libs/ktem&quot;
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of this project. Use `.env.example` as a template

   The `.env` file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app (e.g. deploy the app on HF hub). The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs.

3. (Optional) To enable in-browser `PDF_JS` viewer, download [PDF_JS_DIST](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v4.0.379/pdfjs-4.0.379-dist.zip) then extract it to `libs/ktem/ktem/assets/prebuilt`

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/pdf-viewer-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;pdf-setup&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;

4. Start the web server:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

   - The app will be automatically launched in your browser.
   - Default username and password are both `admin`. You can set up additional users directly through the UI.

   ![Chat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/chat-tab.png)

5. Check the `Resources` tab and `LLMs and Embeddings` and ensure that your `api_key` value is set correctly from your `.env` file. If it is not set, you can set it there.

### Setup GraphRAG

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Official MS GraphRAG indexing only works with OpenAI or Ollama API.
&gt; We recommend most users to use NanoGraphRAG implementation for straightforward integration with Kotaemon.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup Nano GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install nano-GraphRAG: `pip install nano-graphrag`
- `nano-graphrag` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_NANO_GRAPHRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from NanoGraphRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup LIGHTRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- Install LightRAG: `pip install git+https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git`
- `LightRAG` install might introduce version conflicts, see [this issue](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/440)
  - To quickly fix: `pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib`
- Launch Kotaemon with `USE_LIGHTRAG=true` environment variable.
- Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from LightRAG.

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Setup MS GRAPHRAG&lt;/summary&gt;

- **Non-Docker Installation**: If you are not using Docker, install GraphRAG with the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install &quot;graphrag&lt;=0.3.6&quot; future
  ```

- **Setting Up API KEY**: To use the GraphRAG retriever feature, ensure you set the `GRAPHRAG_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this directly in your environment or by adding it to a `.env` file.
- **Using Local Models and Custom Settings**: If you want to use GraphRAG with local models (like `Ollama`) or customize the default LLM and other configurations, set the `USE_CUSTOMIZED_GRAPHRAG_SETTING` environment variable to true. Then, adjust your settings in the `settings.yaml.example` file.

&lt;/details&gt;

### Setup Local Models (for local/private RAG)

See [Local model setup](docs/local_model.md).

### Setup multimodal document parsing (OCR, table parsing, figure extraction)

These options are available:

- [Azure Document Intelligence (API)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
- [Adobe PDF Extract (API)](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/)
- [Docling (local, open-source)](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling)
  - To use Docling, first install required dependencies: `pip install docling`

Select corresponding loaders in `Settings -&gt; Retrieval Settings -&gt; File loader`

### Customize your application

- By default, all application data is stored in the `./ktem_app_data` folder. You can back up or copy this folder to transfer your installation to a new machine.

- For advanced users or specific use cases, you can customize these files:

  - `flowsettings.py`
  - `.env`

#### `flowsettings.py`

This file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example
[here](flowsettings.py) as the starting point.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Notable settings&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
# setup your preferred document store (with full-text search capabilities)
KH_DOCSTORE=(Elasticsearch | LanceDB | SimpleFileDocumentStore)

# setup your preferred vectorstore (for vector-based search)
KH_VECTORSTORE=(ChromaDB | LanceDB | InMemory | Milvus | Qdrant)

# Enable / disable multimodal QA
KH_REASONINGS_USE_MULTIMODAL=True

# Setup your new reasoning pipeline or modify existing one.
KH_REASONINGS = [
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.simple.FullDecomposeQAPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.react.ReactAgentPipeline&quot;,
    &quot;ktem.reasoning.rewoo.RewooAgentPipeline&quot;,
]
```

&lt;/details&gt;

#### `.env`

This file provides another way to configure your models and credentials.

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Configure model via the .env file&lt;/summary&gt;

- Alternatively, you can configure the models via the `.env` file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in the folder of the application. If you don&#039;t see it, you can create one.

- Currently, the following providers are supported:

  - **OpenAI**

    In the `.env` file, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your OpenAI API key in order
    to enable access to OpenAI&#039;s models. There are other variables that can be modified,
    please feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should
    work for most people.

    ```shell
    OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
    OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your OpenAI API key here&gt;
    OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
    OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Azure OpenAI**

    For OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API
    key. Your might also need to provide your developments&#039; name for the chat model and the
    embedding model depending on how you set up Azure development.

    ```shell
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
    OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
    AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-35-turbo
    AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-ada-002
    ```

  - **Local Models**

    - Using `ollama` OpenAI compatible server:

      - Install [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and start the application.

      - Pull your model, for example:

        ```shell
        ollama pull llama3.1:8b
        ollama pull nomic-embed-text
        ```

      - Set the model names on web UI and make it as default:

        ![Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/models.png)

    - Using `GGUF` with `llama-cpp-python`

      You can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Currently, these model formats are supported:

      - GGUF

        You should choose a model whose size is less than your device&#039;s memory and should leave
        about 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available,
        then you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to
        give better generation but also take more processing time.

        Here are some recommendations and their size in memory:

      - [Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen1_5-1_8b-chat-q8_0.gguf?download=true): around 2 GB

        Add a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web UI.

  &lt;/details&gt;

### Adding your own RAG pipeline

#### Custom Reasoning Pipeline

1. Check the default pipeline implementation in [here](libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/simple.py). You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work.
2. Add new `.py` implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/` and later include it in `flowssettings` to enable it on the UI.

#### Custom Indexing Pipeline

- Check sample implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/graph`

&gt; (more instruction WIP).

# MAVLink

MAVLink -- Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library.

MAVLink is a very lightweight, header-only message library for communication between drones and/or ground control stations. It consists primarily of message-set specifications for different systems (&quot;dialects&quot;) defined in XML files, and Python tools that convert these into appropriate source code for [supported languages](https://mavlink.io/en/#supported_languages). There are additional Python scripts providing examples and utilities for working with MAVLink data.

&gt; **Tip** MAVLink is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth. Its reference implementation in C is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.


## Quick start

### Generate C headers

To install the minimal MAVLink environment on Ubuntu LTS 20.04 or 22.04, enter the following on a terminal:

```bash
# Dependencies
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Clone mavlink into the directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink.git --recursive
cd mavlink

python3 -m pip install -r pymavlink/requirements.txt
```

You can then build the MAVLink2 C-library for `message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml` from the `/mavlink` directory as shown:

```bash
python3 -m pymavlink.tools.mavgen --lang=C --wire-protocol=2.0 --output=generated/include/mavlink/v2.0 message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml
```

### Use from cmake

To include the headers in cmake, install them locally, e.g. into the directory `install`:

```
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DMAVLINK_DIALECT=common -DMAVLINK_VERSION=2.0
cmake --build build --target install
```

Then use `find_package` to get the dependency in `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
find_package(MAVLink REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_program my_program.c)

target_link_libraries(my_program PRIVATE MAVLink::mavlink)
```

And pass the local install directory to cmake (adapt to your directory structure):

```
cd ../my_program
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../mavlink/install
```

For a full example, check [examples/c](examples/c).

*Note: even though we use `target_link_libraries` in cmake, it doesn&#039;t actually &quot;link&quot; to MAVLink as it&#039;s just a header-only library.*

### Other instructions

Instructions for using the C libraries are then covered in [Using C MAVLink Libraries (mavgen)](https://mavlink.io/en/mavgen_c/).

&gt; **Note:** [Installing the MAVLink Toolchain](https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/installation.html) explains how to install MAVLink on other Ubuntu platforms and Windows, while [Generating MAVLink Libraries](https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/generate_libraries.html) explains how to build MAVLink for the other programming languages [supported by the project](https://mavlink.io/en/#supported_languages).
&gt; The sub-topics of [Using MAVLink Libraries](https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/use_libraries.html) explain how to use the generated libraries.

Click on above image to watch the tutorial for installation and configuration or use this link https://youtu.be/f9rdz74e1lM (Recommended to watch it in 2x speed)

1. [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) or above. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and install Python, or for windows you could visit Microsoft Store and search for &quot;Python&quot;. **Please make sure Python is added to Path in System Environment Variables**.
2. Install necessary [Undetected Chromedriver](https://pypi.org/project/undetected-chromedriver/), [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) and [Setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) packages. After Python is installed, OPEN a console/terminal or shell, Use below command that uses the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) command-line tool to install these 3 package.
  ```
  pip install undetected-chromedriver pyautogui setuptools openai flask-cors flask
  ```
3. Download and install latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) in it&#039;s default location, visit https://www.google.com/chrome to download it&#039;s installer.
4. Clone the current git repo or download it as a zip file, url to the latest update https://github.com/GodsScion/Auto_job_applier_linkedIn.
5. (Not needed if you set `stealth_mode = True` in `config/settings.py` ) Download and install the appropriate [Chrome Driver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) for Google Chrome and paste it in the location Chrome was installed, visit https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ to download.
  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
  ***OR*** 
  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
  If you are using Windows, click on `windows-setup.bat` available in the `/setup` folder, this will install the latest chromedriver automatically.
6. If you have questions or need help setting it up or to talk in general, join the github server: https://discord.gg/fFp7uUzWCY

&lt;br&gt;

## 🔧 How to configure
1. Open `personals.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your details like name, phone number, address, etc. Whatever you want to fill in your applications.
2. Open `questions.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your answers for application questions, configure wether you want the bot to pause before submission or pause if it can&#039;t answer unknown questions.
3. Open `search.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your search preferences, job filters, configure the bot as per your needs (these settings decide which jobs to apply for or skip).
4. Open `secrets.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your LinkedIn username, password to login and OpenAI API Key for generation of job tailored resumes and cover letters (This entire step is optional). If you do not provide username or password or leave them as default, it will login with saved profile in browser, if failed will ask you to login manually.
5. Open `settings.py` file in `/config` folder to configure the bot settings like, keep screen awake, click intervals (click intervals are randomized to seem like human behavior), run in background, stealth mode (to avoid bot detection), etc. as per your needs.
6. (Optional) Don&#039;t forget to add you default resume in the location you mentioned in `default_resume_path = &quot;all resumes/default/resume.pdf&quot;` given in `/config/questions.py`. If one is not provided, it will use your previous resume submitted in LinkedIn or (In Development) generate custom resume if OpenAI APT key is provided!
7. Run `runAiBot.py` and see the magic happen.
8. To run the Applied Jobs history UI, run `app.py` and open web browser on `http://localhost:5000`.
8. If you have questions or need help setting it up or to talk in general, join the github server: https://discord.gg/fFp7uUzWCY

## 🧑‍💻 Contributor Guidelines
Thank you for your efforts and being a part of the community. All contributions are appreciated no matter how small or big. Once you contribute to the code base, your work will be remembered forever.

NOTE: Only Pull request to `community-version` branch will be accepted. Any other requests will be declined by default, especially to main branch.
Once your code is tested, your changes will be merged to the `main` branch in next cycle.

### Code Guidelines
  #### Functions:
  1. All functions or methods are named lower case and snake case
  2. Must have explanation of their purpose. Write explanation surrounded in `&#039;&#039;&#039; Explanation &#039;&#039;&#039;` under the definition `def function() -&gt; None:`. Example:
      ```python
      def function() -&gt; None:
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
        This function does nothing, it&#039;s just an example for explanation placement!
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
      ```
  4. The Types `(str, list, int, list[str], int | float)` for the parameters and returns must be given. Example:
      ```python
      def function(param1: str, param2: list[str], param3: int) -&gt; str:
      ```
  5. Putting all that together some valid examples for function or method declarations would be as follows.
      ```python
      def function_name_in_camel_case(parameter1: driver, parameter2: str) -&gt; list[str] | ValueError:
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
        This function is an example for code guidelines
        &#039;&#039;&#039;
        return [parameter2, parameter2.lower()]
      ```
  6. The hashtag comments on top of functions are optional, which are intended for developers `# Comments for developers`.
      ```python
      # Enter input text function
      def text_input_by_ID(driver: WebDriver, id: str, value: str, time: float=5.0) -&gt; None | Exception:
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          Enters `value` into the input field with the given `id` if found, else throws NotFoundException.
          - `time` is the max time to wait for the element to be found.
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          username_field = WebDriverWait(driver, time).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, id)))
          username_field.send_keys(Keys.CONTROL + &quot;a&quot;)
          username_field.send_keys(value)
      
      ```
   
  #### Variables
  1. All variables must start with lower case, must be in explainable full words. If someone reads the variable name, it should be easy to understand what the variable stores.
  2. All local variables are camel case. Examples:
      ```python
      jobListingsElement = None
      ```
      ```python
      localBufferTime = 5.5
      ```
  3. All global variables are snake case. Example:
      ```
      total_runs = 1
      ```
  4. Mentioning types are optional.
      ```python
      localBufferTime: float | int = 5.5
      ```
  
  #### Configuration variables
  1. All config variables are treated as global variables. They have some extra guidelines.
  2. Must have variable setting explanation, and examples of valid values. Examples:
      ```python
      # Explanation of what this setting will do, and instructions to enter it correctly
      config_variable = &quot;value1&quot;    #  &lt;Valid values examples, and NOTES&gt; &quot;value1&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;, etc. Don&#039;t forget quotes (&quot;&quot;)
      ```
      ```python
      # Do you want to randomize the search order for search_terms?
      randomize_search_order = False     # True of False, Note: True or False are case-sensitive
      ```
      ```python
      # Avoid applying to jobs if their required experience is above your current_experience. (Set value as -1 if you want to apply to all ignoring their required experience...)
      current_experience = 5             # Integers &gt; -2 (Ex: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...)
      ```
      ```python
      # Search location, this will be filled in &quot;City, state, or zip code&quot; search box. If left empty as &quot;&quot;, tool will not fill it.
      search_location = &quot;United States&quot;               # Some valid examples: &quot;&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Chicago, Illinois, United States&quot;, &quot;90001, Los Angeles, California, United States&quot;, &quot;Bengaluru, Karnataka, India&quot;, etc.

      ```
  4. Add the config variable in appropriate `/config/file`.
  5. Every config variable must be validated. Go to `/modules/validator.py` and add it over there. Example:
      For config variable `search_location = &quot;&quot;` found in `/config/search.py`, string validation is added in file `/modules/validator.py` under the method `def validate_search()`.
      ```python
      def validate_search() -&gt; None | ValueError | TypeError:
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          Validates all variables in the `/config/search.py` file.
          &#039;&#039;&#039;
          check_string(search_location, &quot;search_location&quot;)
      ```

**ExecuTorch** is PyTorch&#039;s unified solution for deploying AI models on-device—from smartphones to microcontrollers—built for privacy, performance, and portability. It powers Meta&#039;s on-device AI across **Instagram, WhatsApp, Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses**, and [more](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/success-stories.html).

Deploy **LLMs, vision, speech, and multimodal models** with the same PyTorch APIs you already know—accelerating research to production with seamless model export, optimization, and deployment. No manual C++ rewrites. No format conversions. No vendor lock-in.

## Why ExecuTorch?

- **🔒 Native PyTorch Export** — Direct export from PyTorch. No .onnx, .tflite, or intermediate format conversions. Preserve model semantics.
- **⚡ Production-Proven** — Powers billions of users at [Meta with real-time on-device inference](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/07/28/android/executorch-on-device-ml-meta-family-of-apps/).
- **💾 Tiny Runtime** — 50KB base footprint. Runs on microcontrollers to high-end smartphones.
- **🚀 [12+ Hardware Backends](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/backends-overview.html)** — Open-source acceleration for Apple, Qualcomm, ARM, MediaTek, Vulkan, and more.
- **🎯 One Export, Multiple Backends** — Switch hardware targets with a single line change. Deploy the same model everywhere.

## How It Works

ExecuTorch uses **ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation** to prepare PyTorch models for edge deployment:

1. **🧩 Export** — Capture your PyTorch model graph with `torch.export()`
2. **⚙️ Compile** — Quantize, optimize, and partition to hardware backends → `.pte`
3. **🚀 Execute** — Load `.pte` on-device via lightweight C++ runtime

Models use a standardized [Core ATen operator set](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/compiler-ir-advanced.html#intermediate-representation). [Partitioners](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/compiler-delegate-and-partitioner.html) delegate subgraphs to specialized hardware (NPU/GPU) with CPU fallback.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install executorch
```

For platform-specific setup (Android, iOS, embedded systems), see the [Quick Start](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/quick-start-section.html) documentation for additional info.

### Export and Deploy in 3 Steps

```python
import torch
from executorch.exir import to_edge_transform_and_lower
from executorch.backends.xnnpack.partition.xnnpack_partitioner import XnnpackPartitioner

# 1. Export your PyTorch model
model = MyModel().eval()
example_inputs = (torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224),)
exported_program = torch.export.export(model, example_inputs)

# 2. Optimize for target hardware (switch backends with one line)
program = to_edge_transform_and_lower(
    exported_program,
    partitioner=[XnnpackPartitioner()]  # CPU | CoreMLPartitioner() for iOS | QnnPartitioner() for Qualcomm
).to_executorch()

# 3. Save for deployment
with open(&quot;model.pte&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:
    f.write(program.buffer)

# Test locally via ExecuTorch runtime&#039;s pybind API (optional)
from executorch.runtime import Runtime
runtime = Runtime.get()
method = runtime.load_program(&quot;model.pte&quot;).load_method(&quot;forward&quot;)
outputs = method.execute([torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)])
```

### Run on Device

**[C++](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/using-executorch-cpp.html)**
```cpp
#include &lt;executorch/extension/module/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;executorch/extension/tensor/tensor.h&gt;

Module module(&quot;model.pte&quot;);
auto tensor = make_tensor_ptr({2, 2}, {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f});
auto outputs = module.forward(tensor);
```

**[Swift (iOS)](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/ios-section.html)**
```swift
import ExecuTorch

let module = Module(filePath: &quot;model.pte&quot;)
let input = Tensor&lt;Float&gt;([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], shape: [2, 2])
let outputs = try module.forward(input)
```

**[Kotlin (Android)](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/android-section.html)**
```kotlin
val module = Module.load(&quot;model.pte&quot;)
val inputTensor = Tensor.fromBlob(floatArrayOf(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f), longArrayOf(2, 2))
val outputs = module.forward(EValue.from(inputTensor))
```

### LLM Example: Llama

Export Llama models using the [`export_llm`](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/llm/export-llm.html) script or [Optimum-ExecuTorch](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-executorch):

```bash
# Using export_llm
python -m executorch.extension.llm.export.export_llm --model llama3_2 --output llama.pte

# Using Optimum-ExecuTorch
optimum-cli export executorch \
  --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B \
  --task text-generation \
  --recipe xnnpack \
  --output_dir llama_model
```

Run on-device with the LLM runner API:

**[C++](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/llm/run-with-c-plus-plus.html)**
```cpp
#include &lt;executorch/extension/llm/runner/text_llm_runner.h&gt;

auto runner = create_llama_runner(&quot;llama.pte&quot;, &quot;tiktoken.bin&quot;);
executorch::extension::llm::GenerationConfig config{
    .seq_len = 128, .temperature = 0.8f};
runner-&gt;generate(&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;, config);
```

**[Swift (iOS)](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/llm/run-on-ios.html)**
```swift
import ExecuTorchLLM

let runner = TextRunner(modelPath: &quot;llama.pte&quot;, tokenizerPath: &quot;tiktoken.bin&quot;)
try runner.generate(&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;, Config {
    $0.sequenceLength = 128
}) { token in
    print(token, terminator: &quot;&quot;)
}
```

**Kotlin (Android)** — [API Docs](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/main/javadoc/org/pytorch/executorch/extension/llm/package-summary.html) • [Demo App](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/executorch-examples/tree/main/llm/android/LlamaDemo)
```kotlin
val llmModule = LlmModule(&quot;llama.pte&quot;, &quot;tiktoken.bin&quot;, 0.8f)
llmModule.load()
llmModule.generate(&quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;, 128, object : LlmCallback {
    override fun onResult(result: String) { print(result) }
    override fun onStats(stats: String) { }
})
```

For multimodal models (vision, audio), use the [MultiModal runner API](extension/llm/runner) which extends the LLM runner to handle image and audio inputs alongside text. See [Llava](examples/models/llava/README.md) and [Voxtral](examples/models/voxtral/README.md) examples.

See [examples/models/llama](examples/models/llama/README.md) for complete workflow including quantization, mobile deployment, and advanced options.
