            <h2>README</h2><pre># Hugging Face Skills

Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic&#039;s Claude Code, Google DeepMind&#039;s Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## How do Skills work?

In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. 

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; &#039;Skills&#039; is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an `AGENTS.md` file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses &#039;extensions&#039; to define the instructions for your coding agent in a `gemini-extension.json` file. **This repo is compatible with all of them, and more!**

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; If your agent doesn&#039;t support skills, you can use [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) directly as a fallback.

## Installation

Hugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

### Claude Code

1. Register the repository as a plugin marketplace:  
   
```
/plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills
```

2. To install a skill, run:  
   
```
/plugin install &lt;skill-name&gt;@huggingface/skills
```

For example:  

```
/plugin install hugging-face-cli@huggingface/skills
```

### Codex

1. Codex will identify the skills via the `AGENTS.md` file. You can verify the instructions are loaded with:

```
codex --ask-for-approval never &quot;Summarize the current instructions.&quot;
```

2. For more details, see the [Codex AGENTS guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md).

### Gemini CLI

1. This repo includes `gemini-extension.json` to integrate with the Gemini CLI.

2. Install locally:  

```
gemini extensions install . --consent
```

or use the GitHub URL:

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent
```

4. See [Gemini CLI extensions docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/#installing-an-extension) for more help.

### Cursor

This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json` (configured with the Hugging Face MCP server URL)

Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow.

For contributors, regenerate manifests with:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

&lt;!-- END_SKILLS_TABLE --&gt;

### Using skills in your coding agent

Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions:

- &quot;Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch `run_eval_job.py` on the latest checkpoint.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates.&quot;
- &quot;Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model.&quot;

Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding `SKILL.md` instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task.

### Contribute or customize a skill

1. Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `hf-datasets/`) and rename it.
2. Update the new folder&#039;s `SKILL.md` frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill-name
   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
   ---

   # Skill Title
   Guidance + examples + guardrails
   ```
3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.
4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with a concise, human-readable description.
5. Run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/publish.sh
   ```
   to regenerate and validate all generated metadata.
6. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.

### Marketplace

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file lists skills with human-readable descriptions for the plugin marketplace. The CI validates that skill names and paths match between `SKILL.md` files and `marketplace.json`, but descriptions are maintained separately: `SKILL.md` descriptions guide when Claude activates the skill, while marketplace descriptions are written for humans browsing available skills.

### Additional references
- Browse the latest instructions, scripts, and templates directly at [huggingface/skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills).
- Review Hugging Face documentation for the specific libraries or workflows you reference inside each skill.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Claude Code Telegram Bot

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

A Telegram bot that gives you remote access to [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Chat naturally with Claude about your projects from anywhere -- no terminal commands needed.

## What is this?

This bot connects Telegram to Claude Code, providing a conversational AI interface for your codebase:

- **Chat naturally** -- ask Claude to analyze, edit, or explain your code in plain language
- **Maintain context** across conversations with automatic session persistence per project
- **Code on the go** from any device with Telegram
- **Receive proactive notifications** from webhooks, scheduled jobs, and CI/CD events
- **Stay secure** with built-in authentication, directory sandboxing, and audit logging

## Quick Start

### Demo

```
You: Can you help me add error handling to src/api.py?

Bot: I&#039;ll analyze src/api.py and add error handling...
     [Claude reads your code, suggests improvements, and can apply changes directly]

You: Looks good. Now run the tests to make sure nothing broke.

Bot: Running pytest...
     All 47 tests passed. The error handling changes are working correctly.
```

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** -- [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Claude Code CLI** -- [Install from here](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Telegram Bot Token** -- Get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)

### 2. Install

Choose your preferred method:

#### Option A: Install from a release tag (Recommended)

```bash
# Using uv (recommended — installs in an isolated environment)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram@v1.3.0

# Or using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram@v1.3.0

# Track the latest stable release
pip install git+https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram@latest
```

#### Option B: From source (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram.git
cd claude-code-telegram
make dev  # requires Poetry
```

&gt; **Note:** Always install from a tagged release (not `main`) for stability. See [Releases](https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram/releases) for available versions.

### 3. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings:
```

**Minimum required:**
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=my_claude_bot
APPROVED_DIRECTORY=/Users/yourname/projects
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789  # Your Telegram user ID
```

### 4. Run

```bash
make run          # Production
make run-debug    # With debug logging
```

Message your bot on Telegram to get started.

&gt; **Detailed setup:** See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for Claude authentication options and troubleshooting.

## Modes

The bot supports two interaction modes:

### Agentic Mode (Default)

The default conversational mode. Just talk to Claude naturally -- no special commands required.

**Commands:** `/start`, `/new`, `/status`, `/verbose`, `/repo`
If `ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true`: `/sync_threads`

```
You: What files are in this project?
Bot: Working... (3s)
     📖 Read
     📂 LS
     💬 Let me describe the project structure
Bot: [Claude describes the project structure]

You: Add a retry decorator to the HTTP client
Bot: Working... (8s)
     📖 Read: http_client.py
     💬 I&#039;ll add a retry decorator with exponential backoff
     ✏️ Edit: http_client.py
     💻 Bash: poetry run pytest tests/ -v
Bot: [Claude shows the changes and test results]

You: /verbose 0
Bot: Verbosity set to 0 (quiet)
```

Use `/verbose 0|1|2` to control how much background activity is shown:

| Level | Shows |
|-------|-------|
| **0** (quiet) | Final response only (typing indicator stays active) |
| **1** (normal, default) | Tool names + reasoning snippets in real-time |
| **2** (detailed) | Tool names with inputs + longer reasoning text |

#### GitHub Workflow

Claude Code already knows how to use `gh` CLI and `git`. Authenticate on your server with `gh auth login`, then work with repos conversationally:

```
You: List my repos related to monitoring
Bot: [Claude runs gh repo list, shows results]

You: Clone the uptime one
Bot: [Claude runs gh repo clone, clones into workspace]

You: /repo
Bot: 📦 uptime-monitor/  ◀
     📁 other-project/

You: Show me the open issues
Bot: [Claude runs gh issue list]

You: Create a fix branch and push it
Bot: [Claude creates branch, commits, pushes]
```

Use `/repo` to list cloned repos in your workspace, or `/repo &lt;name&gt;` to switch directories (sessions auto-resume).

### Classic Mode

Set `AGENTIC_MODE=false` to enable the full 13-command terminal-like interface with directory navigation, inline keyboards, quick actions, git integration, and session export.

**Commands:** `/start`, `/help`, `/new`, `/continue`, `/end`, `/status`, `/cd`, `/ls`, `/pwd`, `/projects`, `/export`, `/actions`, `/git`  
If `ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true`: `/sync_threads`

```
You: /cd my-web-app
Bot: Directory changed to my-web-app/

You: /ls
Bot: src/  tests/  package.json  README.md

You: /actions
Bot: [Run Tests] [Install Deps] [Format Code] [Run Linter]
```

## Event-Driven Automation

Beyond direct chat, the bot can respond to external triggers:

- **Webhooks** -- Receive GitHub events (push, PR, issues) and route them through Claude for automated summaries or code review
- **Scheduler** -- Run recurring Claude tasks on a cron schedule (e.g., daily code health checks)
- **Notifications** -- Deliver agent responses to configured Telegram chats

Enable with `ENABLE_API_SERVER=true` and `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true`. See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for configuration.

## Configuration

### Required

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...           # From @BotFather
TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=...        # Your bot&#039;s username
APPROVED_DIRECTORY=...           # Base directory for project access
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789          # Comma-separated Telegram user IDs
```

### Common Options

```bash
# Claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...     # API key (optional if using CLI auth)
CLAUDE_MAX_COST_PER_USER=10.0    # Spending limit per user (USD)
CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300       # Operation timeout

# Mode
AGENTIC_MODE=true                # Agentic (default) or classic mode
VERBOSE_LEVEL=1                  # 0=quiet, 1=normal (default), 2=detailed

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=10           # Requests per window
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60             # Window in seconds

# Features (classic mode)
ENABLE_GIT_INTEGRATION=true
ENABLE_FILE_UPLOADS=true
ENABLE_QUICK_ACTIONS=true
```

### Agentic Platform

```bash
# Webhook API Server
ENABLE_API_SERVER=false          # Enable FastAPI webhook server
API_SERVER_PORT=8080             # Server port

# Webhook Authentication
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...        # GitHub HMAC-SHA256 secret
WEBHOOK_API_SECRET=...           # Bearer token for generic providers

# Scheduler
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false           # Enable cron job scheduler

# Notifications
NOTIFICATION_CHAT_IDS=123,456    # Default chat IDs for proactive notifications
```

### Project Threads Mode

```bash
# Enable strict topic routing by project
ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true

# Mode: private (default) or group
PROJECT_THREADS_MODE=private

# YAML registry file (see config/projects.example.yaml)
PROJECTS_CONFIG_PATH=config/projects.yaml

# Required only when PROJECT_THREADS_MODE=group
PROJECT_THREADS_CHAT_ID=-1001234567890

# Minimum delay (seconds) between Telegram API calls during topic sync
# Set 0 to disable pacing
PROJECT_THREADS_SYNC_ACTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1.1
```

In strict mode, only `/start` and `/sync_threads` work outside mapped project topics.
In private mode, `/start` auto-syncs project topics for your private bot chat.
To use topics with your bot, enable them in BotFather:
`Bot Settings -&gt; Threaded mode`.

&gt; **Full reference:** See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) and [`.env.example`](.env.example).

### Finding Your Telegram User ID

Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram -- it will reply with your user ID number.

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn&#039;t respond:**
- Check your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- Verify your user ID is in `ALLOWED_USERS`
- Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and accessible
- Check bot logs with `make run-debug`

**Claude integration not working:**
- SDK mode (default): Check `claude auth status` or verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- CLI mode: Verify `claude --version` and `claude auth status`
- Check `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS` includes necessary tools (see [docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md) for the full reference)

**High usage costs:**
- Adjust `CLAUDE_MAX_COST_PER_USER` to set spending limits
- Monitor usage with `/status`
- Use shorter, more focused requests

## Security

This bot implements defense-in-depth security:

- **Access Control** -- Whitelist-based user authentication
- **Directory Isolation** -- Sandboxing to approved directories
- **Rate Limiting** -- Request and cost-based limits
- **Input Validation** -- Injection and path traversal protection
- **Webhook Authentication** -- GitHub HMAC-SHA256 and Bearer token verification
- **Audit Logging** -- Complete tracking of all user actions

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Development

```bash
make dev           # Install all dependencies
make test          # Run tests with coverage
make lint          # Black + isort + flake8 + mypy
make format        # Auto-format code
make run-debug     # Run with debug logging
```

### Version Management

The version is defined once in `pyproject.toml` and read at runtime via `importlib.metadata`. To cut a release:

```bash
make bump-patch    # 1.2.0 -&gt; 1.2.1 (bug fixes)
make bump-minor    # 1.2.0 -&gt; 1.3.0 (new features)
make bump-major    # 1.2.0 -&gt; 2.0.0 (breaking changes)
```

Each command commits, tags, and pushes automatically, triggering CI tests and a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.

## Quickstart

### Basic Agent - Python

Create a simple Azure Responses Agent that writes a haiku about the Microsoft Agent Framework

```python
# pip install agent-framework --pre
# Use `az login` to authenticate with Azure CLI
import os
import asyncio
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIResponsesClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential


async def main():
    # Initialize a chat agent with Azure OpenAI Responses
    # the endpoint, deployment name, and api version can be set via environment variables
    # or they can be passed in directly to the AzureOpenAIResponsesClient constructor
    agent = AzureOpenAIResponsesClient(
        # endpoint=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT&quot;],
        # deployment_name=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_RESPONSES_DEPLOYMENT_NAME&quot;],
        # api_version=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION&quot;],
        # api_key=os.environ[&quot;AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;],  # Optional if using AzureCliCredential
        credential=AzureCliCredential(), # Optional, if using api_key
    ).as_agent(
        name=&quot;HaikuBot&quot;,
        instructions=&quot;You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.&quot;,
    )

    print(await agent.run(&quot;Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.&quot;))

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Basic Agent - .NET

Create a simple Agent, using OpenAI Responses, that writes a haiku about the Microsoft Agent Framework

```c#
// dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using OpenAI;
using OpenAI.Responses;

// Replace the &lt;apikey&gt; with your OpenAI API key.
var agent = new OpenAIClient(&quot;&lt;apikey&gt;&quot;)
    .GetResponsesClient(&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;)
    .AsAIAgent(name: &quot;HaikuBot&quot;, instructions: &quot;You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.&quot;);

Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync(&quot;Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.&quot;));
```

Create a simple Agent, using Azure OpenAI Responses with token based auth, that writes a haiku about the Microsoft Agent Framework

```c#
// dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
// dotnet add package Azure.Identity
// Use `az login` to authenticate with Azure CLI
using System.ClientModel.Primitives;
using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using OpenAI;
using OpenAI.Responses;

// Replace &lt;resource&gt; and gpt-4o-mini with your Azure OpenAI resource name and deployment name.
var agent = new OpenAIClient(
    new BearerTokenPolicy(new AzureCliCredential(), &quot;https://ai.azure.com/.default&quot;),
    new OpenAIClientOptions() { Endpoint = new Uri(&quot;https://&lt;resource&gt;.openai.azure.com/openai/v1&quot;) })
    .GetResponsesClient(&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;)
    .AsAIAgent(name: &quot;HaikuBot&quot;, instructions: &quot;You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.&quot;);

## Important Notes

If you use the Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization&#039;s Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.

TimesFM (Time Series Foundation Model) is a pretrained time-series foundation
model developed by Google Research for time-series forecasting.

*   Paper:
    [A decoder-only foundation model for time-series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10688),
    ICML 2024.
*   All checkpoints:
    [TimesFM Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/timesfm-release-66e4be5fdb56e960c1e482a6).
*   [Google Research blog](https://research.google/blog/a-decoder-only-foundation-model-for-time-series-forecasting/).
*   [TimesFM in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/timesfm-model):
    an official Google product.

This open version is not an officially supported Google product.

**Latest Model Version:** TimesFM 2.5

**Archived Model Versions:**

-   1.0 and 2.0: relevant code archived in the sub directory `v1`. You can `pip
    install timesfm==1.3.0` to install an older version of this package to load
    them.

## Update - Oct. 29, 2025

Added back the covariate support through XReg for TimesFM 2.5.


## Update - Sept. 15, 2025

TimesFM 2.5 is out!

Comparing to TimesFM 2.0, this new 2.5 model:

-   uses 200M parameters, down from 500M.
-   supports up to 16k context length, up from 2048.
-   supports continuous quantile forecast up to 1k horizon via an optional 30M
    quantile head.
-   gets rid of the `frequency` indicator.
-   has a couple of new forecasting flags.

Along with the model upgrade we have also upgraded the inference API. This repo
will be under construction over the next few weeks to

1.  add support for an upcoming Flax version of the model (faster inference).
2.  add back covariate support.
3.  populate more docstrings, docs and notebook.

### Install

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/google-research/timesfm.git
    cd timesfm
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`:
    ```shell
    # Create a virtual environment
    uv venv
    
    # Activate the environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install the package in editable mode with torch
    uv pip install -e .[torch]
    # Or with flax
    uv pip install -e .[flax]
    # Or XReg is needed
    uv pip install -e .[xreg]
    ```

3. [Optional] Install your preferred `torch` / `jax` backend based on your OS and accelerators
(CPU, GPU, TPU or Apple Silicon).:

-   [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
-   [Install Jax](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#installation)
    for Flax.

### Code Example

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import timesfm

torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(&quot;high&quot;)

model = timesfm.TimesFM_2p5_200M_torch.from_pretrained(&quot;google/timesfm-2.5-200m-pytorch&quot;)

model.compile(
    timesfm.ForecastConfig(
        max_context=1024,
        max_horizon=256,
        normalize_inputs=True,
        use_continuous_quantile_head=True,
        force_flip_invariance=True,
        infer_is_positive=True,
        fix_quantile_crossing=True,
    )
)
point_forecast, quantile_forecast = model.forecast(
    horizon=12,
    inputs=[
        np.linspace(0, 1, 100),
        np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20, 67)),
    ],  # Two dummy inputs
)
point_forecast.shape  # (2, 12)
quantile_forecast.shape  # (2, 12, 10): mean, then 10th to 90th quantiles.
```

## Strix Overview

Strix are autonomous AI agents that act just like real hackers - they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them through actual proof-of-concepts. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without the overhead of manual pentesting or the false positives of static analysis tools.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Full hacker toolkit** out of the box
- **Teams of agents** that collaborate and scale
- **Real validation** with PoCs, not false positives
- **Developer‑first** CLI with actionable reports
- **Auto‑fix &amp; reporting** to accelerate remediation


&lt;br&gt;


&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;.github/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Strix Demo&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; style=&quot;border-radius: 16px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


## Use Cases

- **Application Security Testing** - Detect and validate critical vulnerabilities in your applications
- **Rapid Penetration Testing** - Get penetration tests done in hours, not weeks, with compliance reports
- **Bug Bounty Automation** - Automate bug bounty research and generate PoCs for faster reporting
- **CI/CD Integration** - Run tests in CI/CD to block vulnerabilities before reaching production

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker (running)
- An LLM API key:
  - Any [supported provider](https://docs.strix.ai/llm-providers/overview) (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
  - Or [Strix Router](https://models.strix.ai) — single API key for multiple providers with $10 free credit on signup

### Installation &amp; First Scan

```bash
# Install Strix
curl -sSL https://strix.ai/install | bash

# Configure your AI provider
export STRIX_LLM=&quot;openai/gpt-5&quot;  # or &quot;strix/gpt-5&quot; via Strix Router (https://models.strix.ai)
export LLM_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;

# Run your first security assessment
strix --target ./app-directory
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; First run automatically pulls the sandbox Docker image. Results are saved to `strix_runs/&lt;run-name&gt;`

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a local codebase
strix --target ./app-directory

# Security review of a GitHub repository
strix --target https://github.com/org/repo

# Black-box web application assessment
strix --target https://your-app.com
```

### Advanced Testing Scenarios

```bash
# Grey-box authenticated testing
strix --target https://your-app.com --instruction &quot;Perform authenticated testing using credentials: user:pass&quot;

# Multi-target testing (source code + deployed app)
strix -t https://github.com/org/app -t https://your-app.com

# Focused testing with custom instructions
strix --target api.your-app.com --instruction &quot;Focus on business logic flaws and IDOR vulnerabilities&quot;

# Provide detailed instructions through file (e.g., rules of engagement, scope, exclusions)
strix --target api.your-app.com --instruction-file ./instruction.md
```

### Headless Mode

Run Strix programmatically without interactive UI using the `-n/--non-interactive` flag—perfect for servers and automated jobs. The CLI prints real-time vulnerability findings, and the final report before exiting. Exits with non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found.

```bash
strix -n --target https://your-app.com
```

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Strix can be added to your pipeline to run a security test on pull requests with a lightweight GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: strix-penetration-test

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Install Strix
        run: curl -sSL https://strix.ai/install | bash

      - name: Run Strix
        env:
          STRIX_LLM: ${{ secrets.STRIX_LLM }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}

        run: strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode quick
```

### Configuration

```bash
export STRIX_LLM=&quot;openai/gpt-5&quot;
export LLM_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;

# Optional
export LLM_API_BASE=&quot;your-api-base-url&quot;  # if using a local model, e.g. Ollama, LMStudio
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key&quot;  # for search capabilities
export STRIX_REASONING_EFFORT=&quot;high&quot;  # control thinking effort (default: high, quick scan: medium)
```

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Strix automatically saves your configuration to `~/.strix/cli-config.json`, so you don&#039;t have to re-enter it on every run.

**Recommended models for best results:**

- [OpenAI GPT-5](https://openai.com/api/) — `openai/gpt-5`
- [Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6](https://claude.com/platform/api) — `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`
- [Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) — `vertex_ai/gemini-3-pro-preview`

See the [LLM Providers documentation](https://docs.strix.ai/llm-providers/overview) for all supported providers including Vertex AI, Bedrock, Azure, and local models.

## 🤔 What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the &quot;real work&quot; of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install Specify CLI

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use everywhere:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

Then use the tool directly:

```bash
# Create new project
specify init &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;

# Or initialize in existing project
specify init . --ai claude
# or
specify init --here --ai claude

# Check installed tools
specify check
```

To upgrade Specify, see the [Upgrade Guide](./docs/upgrade.md) for detailed instructions. Quick upgrade:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

#### Option 2: One-time Usage

Run directly without installing:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;
```

**Benefits of persistent installation:**

- Tool stays installed and available in PATH
- No need to create shell aliases
- Better tool management with `uv tool list`, `uv tool upgrade`, `uv tool uninstall`
- Cleaner shell configuration

### 2. Establish project principles

Launch your AI assistant in the project directory. The `/speckit.*` commands are available in the assistant.

Use the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project&#039;s governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.

```bash
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

### 3. Create the spec

Use the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

```bash
/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

### 4. Create a technical implementation plan

Use the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

### 5. Break down into tasks

Use **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

### 6. Execute implementation

Use **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).

## 📚 Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the &quot;*what*&quot; before the &quot;*how*&quot;
- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## What is it?

**pandas** is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with &quot;relational&quot; or &quot;labeled&quot; data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real-world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open-source data
analysis/manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way towards this goal.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as
    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and
    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional
    objects
  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can
    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically
    align the data for you in computations
  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform
    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating
    and transforming data
  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,
    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures
    into DataFrame objects
  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy
    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of
    large data sets
  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data
    sets
  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of
    data sets
  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple
    labels per tick)
  - Robust I/O tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]
    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],
    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]
  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range
    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,
    date shifting and lagging

## PostHog is an all-in-one, open source platform for building successful products

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) provides every tool you need to build a successful product including:

- [Product Analytics](https://posthog.com/product-analytics): Autocapture or manually instrument event-based analytics to understand user behavior and analyze data with visualization or SQL.
- [Web Analytics](https://posthog.com/web-analytics): Monitor web traffic and user sessions with a GA-like dashboard. Easily monitor conversion, web vitals, and revenue.
- [Session Replays](https://posthog.com/session-replay): Watch real user sessions of interactions with your website or mobile app to diagnose issues and understand user behavior.
- [Feature Flags](https://posthog.com/feature-flags): Safely roll out features to select users or cohorts with feature flags.
- [Experiments](https://posthog.com/experiments): Test changes and measure their statistical impact on goal metrics. Set up experiments with no-code too.
- [Error Tracking](https://posthog.com/error-tracking): Track errors, get alerts, and resolve issues to improve your product.
- [Surveys](https://posthog.com/surveys): Ask anything with our collection of no-code survey templates, or build custom surveys with our survey builder.
- [Data warehouse](https://posthog.com/data-warehouse): Sync data from external tools like Stripe, Hubspot, your data warehouse, and more. Query it alongside your product data.
- [Data pipelines](https://posthog.com/cdp): Run custom filters and transformations on your incoming data. Send it to 25+ tools or any webhook in real time or batch export large amounts to your warehouse.
- [LLM analytics](https://posthog.com/docs/llm-analytics): Capture traces, generations, latency, and cost for your LLM-powered app.
- [Workflows](https://posthog.com/docs/workflows): Create workflows that automate actions or send messages to your users.

Best of all, all of this is free to use with a [generous monthly free tier](https://posthog.com/pricing) for each product. Get started by signing up for [PostHog Cloud US](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup).

## Getting started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is signing up for free to [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses are free every month, after which you pay based on usage.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

If you want to self-host PostHog, you can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

```bash
/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)&quot;
```

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend [migrating to a PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).

We _do not_ provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more info.

## Try It

No install needed. Try trackers in your browser with our [Hugging Face Playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/roboflow/trackers).

## Install

```bash
pip install trackers
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;install from source&lt;/summary&gt;

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/trackers.git
```

&lt;/details&gt;

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eef9b00a-cfe4-40f7-a495-954550e3ef1f

## Track from CLI

Point at a video, webcam, RTSP stream, or image directory. Get tracked output.

Use our [interactive command builder](https://trackers.roboflow.com/develop/learn/track) to configure your tracking pipeline.

```bash
trackers track \
    --source video.mp4 \
    --output output.mp4 \
    --model rfdetr-medium \
    --tracker bytetrack \
    --show-labels \
    --show-trajectories
```

## Track from Python

Plug trackers into your existing detection pipeline. Works with any detector.

```python
import cv2
import supervision as sv
from inference import get_model
from trackers import ByteTrackTracker

model = get_model(model_id=&quot;rfdetr-medium&quot;)
tracker = ByteTrackTracker()

label_annotator = sv.LabelAnnotator()
trajectory_annotator = sv.TrajectoryAnnotator()

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(&quot;video.mp4&quot;)
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    result = model.infer(frame)[0]
    detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(result)
    tracked = tracker.update(detections)

    frame = label_annotator.annotate(frame, tracked)
    frame = trajectory_annotator.annotate(frame, tracked)
```

## Evaluate

Benchmark your tracker against ground truth with standard MOT metrics.

```bash
trackers eval \
    --gt-dir data/gt \
    --tracker-dir data/trackers \
    --metrics CLEAR HOTA Identity
```

```

## CuaBot - Co-op computer-use for any agent

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;img/cuabot-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;cuabot screenshot&quot; width=&quot;720&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

`cuabot` gives any coding agent a seamless sandbox for computer-use. Individual windows appear natively on your desktop with H.265, shared clipboard, and audio.

```bash
npx cuabot                 # Setup onboarding
```

```bash
# Run any agent in a sandbox
cuabot claude              # Claude Code
cuabot openclaw            # OpenClaw in the sandbox

# Run any GUI workflow in a sandbox
cuabot chromium
cuabot --screenshot
cuabot --type &quot;hello&quot;
cuabot --click &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; [button]
```

Built-in support for `agent-browser` and `agent-device` (iOS, Android) out of the box.

## Security

### Authentication

- **Local mode**: No authentication (trusted LAN only)
- **Production mode**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Rate limiting**: 5 failed login attempts = 5 minute lockout

### HTTPS

Production deployments use Caddy for automatic HTTPS:
- Let&#039;s Encrypt certificates (auto-renewed)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Multi-Site Networking

When managing multiple UniFi sites, always use site-to-site VPN:

```
✅ RECOMMENDED: VPN Connection

❌ AVOID: Direct Internet Exposure
Never expose UniFi controllers via port forwarding
```

**VPN Options:** UniFi Site-to-Site, WireGuard, Tailscale, IPSec

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can&#039;t connect to UniFi controller
- Set `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL=false` for self-signed certificates
- UniFi OS devices (UDM, UCG) require an API key, not username/password
- Verify network connectivity to controller

### Device not showing as online
- Wait 60 seconds for the next refresh cycle
- Verify MAC address format is correct
- Confirm device is connected in UniFi dashboard

### Let&#039;s Encrypt certificate fails
- Verify DNS A record points to your server
- Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open
- Check Caddy logs: `docker compose logs caddy`

### Rate limited on login
- Wait 5 minutes for lockout to expire
- Use `./reset_password.sh` if you forgot your password

### Docker issues
- Verify `.env` exists and contains `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Pull latest image: `docker compose pull &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d`

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Azure SDK for Python

This repository is for the active development of the Azure SDK for Python. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/) or our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python).

## Getting started

For your convenience, each service has a separate set of libraries that you can choose to use instead of one, large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the `README.md` (or `README.rst`) file located in the library&#039;s project folder.

You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.

### Prerequisites

The client libraries are supported on Python 3.9 or later. For more details, please read our page on [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).

## Packages available

Each service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:
* [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)
* [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
* [Management - New Releases](#management-new-releases)
* [Management - Previous Versions](#management-previous-versions)

### Client: New Releases

New wave of packages that we are announcing as **GA** and several that are currently releasing in **preview**. These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. These libraries share  several core functionalities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the [azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core) library. You can learn more about these libraries by reading guidelines that they follow [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html).

You can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#python)

&gt; NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.

### Client: Previous Versions

Last stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide you with similar functionalities to the Preview ones as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) or have the same feature set as the November releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.

### Management: New Releases
A new set of management libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/) are now available. These new libraries provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more.
Documentation and code samples for these new libraries can be found [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt). In addition, a migration guide that shows how to transition from older versions of libraries is located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/sphinx/mgmt_quickstart.rst#migration-guide).

You can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/python.html)

&gt; NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries. Also, if you are experiencing authentication issues with the management libraries after upgrading certain packages, it&#039;s possible that you upgraded to the new versions of SDK without changing the authentication code, please refer to the migration guide mentioned above for proper instructions.

### Management: Previous Versions
For a complete list of management libraries that enable you to provision and manage Azure resources, please [check here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/python.html). They might not have the same feature set as the new releases but they do offer wider coverage of services.
Management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-mgmt-`, e.g. `azure-mgmt-compute`

* For detailed documentation visit our [Azure SDK for Python documentation](https://aka.ms/python-docs)
* File an issue via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)
* Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+python) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using `azure` and `python` tags.


## Data Collection
The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described below. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and Microsoft’s [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704). For more information on the data collected by the Azure SDK, please visit the [Telemetry Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy) page.

### Telemetry Configuration
Telemetry collection is on by default.

To opt out, you can disable telemetry at client construction. Define a `NoUserAgentPolicy` class that is a subclass of `UserAgentPolicy` with an `on_request` method that does nothing. Then pass instance of this class as kwargs `user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy()` during client creation. This will disable telemetry for all methods in the client. Do this for every new client.

The example below uses the `azure-storage-blob` package. In your code, you can replace `azure-storage-blob` with the package you are using.

```python
import os
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import UserAgentPolicy


# Create your credential you want to use
mi_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()

account_url = &quot;https://&lt;storageaccountname&gt;.blob.core.windows.net&quot;

# Set up user-agent override
class NoUserAgentPolicy(UserAgentPolicy):
    def on_request(self, request):
        pass

# Create the BlobServiceClient object
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=mi_credential, user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy())

container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container=&lt;container_name&gt;) 
# TODO: do something with the container client like download blob to a file
```

### Reporting security issues and security bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) &lt;secure@microsoft.com&gt;. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

*   **Python 3.10.x:** We strongly recommend using Python version 3.10.x. Using other versions might lead to dependency errors. [Download Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) (pick a 3.10.x version).
*   **Docker Engine &amp; Docker Compose:** For running bundled services like SearxNG.
    *   Install Docker Desktop (which includes Docker Compose V2): [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) | [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) | [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
    *   Alternatively, install Docker Engine and Docker Compose separately on Linux: [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) | [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (ensure you install Compose V2, e.g., `sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin`).

### 1. **Clone the repository and setup**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek
mv .env.example .env
```

### 2. Change the .env file content

```sh
SEARXNG_BASE_URL=&quot;http://searxng:8080&quot; # http://127.0.0.1:8080 if running on host
REDIS_BASE_URL=&quot;redis://redis:6379/0&quot;
WORK_DIR=&quot;/Users/mlg/Documents/workspace_for_ai&quot;
OLLAMA_PORT=&quot;11434&quot;
LM_STUDIO_PORT=&quot;1234&quot;
CUSTOM_ADDITIONAL_LLM_PORT=&quot;11435&quot;
OPENAI_API_KEY=&#039;optional&#039;
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=&#039;optional&#039;
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=&#039;optional&#039;
TOGETHER_API_KEY=&#039;optional&#039;
GOOGLE_API_KEY=&#039;optional&#039;
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&#039;optional&#039;
```


Update the `.env` file with your own values as needed:

- **SEARXNG_BASE_URL**: Leave unchanged unless running on host with CLI mode.
- **REDIS_BASE_URL**: Leave unchanged 
- **WORK_DIR**: Path to your working directory on your local machine. AgenticSeek will be able to read and interact with these files.
- **OLLAMA_PORT**: Port number for the Ollama service.
- **LM_STUDIO_PORT**: Port number for the LM Studio service.
- **CUSTOM_ADDITIONAL_LLM_PORT**: Port for any additional custom LLM service.

**API Key are totally optional for user who choose to run LLM locally. Which is the primary purpose of this project. Leave empty if you have sufficient hardware**

### 3. **Start Docker**

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can start Docker using the following commands:

- **On Linux/macOS:**  
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start docker
    ```
    Or launch Docker Desktop from your applications menu if installed.

- **On Windows:**  
    Start Docker Desktop from the Start menu.

You can verify Docker is running by executing:
```sh
docker info
```
If you see information about your Docker installation, it is running correctly.

See the table of [Local Providers](#list-of-local-providers) below for a summary.

Next step: [Run AgenticSeek locally](#start-services-and-run)

*See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you are having issues.*
*If your hardware can&#039;t run LLMs locally, see [Setup to run with an API](#setup-to-run-with-an-api).*
*For detailed `config.ini` explanations, see [Config Section](#config).*

## Setup for running LLM locally on your machine

**Hardware Requirements:**

To run LLMs locally, you&#039;ll need sufficient hardware. At a minimum, a GPU capable of running Magistral, Qwen or Deepseek 14B is required. See the FAQ for detailed model/performance recommendations.

**Setup your local provider**  

Start your local provider (for example with ollama):

Unless you wish to to run AgenticSeek on host (CLI mode), export or set the provider listen address:

```sh
export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434
```

Then, start you provider:

```sh
ollama serve
```

See below for a list of local supported provider.

**Update the config.ini**

Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to a supported provider and provider_model to a LLM supported by your provider. We recommend reasoning model such as *Magistral* or *Deepseek*.

See the **FAQ** at the end of the README for required hardware.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = True # Whenever you are running locally or with remote provider.
provider_name = ollama # or lm-studio, openai, etc..
provider_model = deepseek-r1:14b # choose a model that fit your hardware
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
agent_name = Jarvis # name of your AI
recover_last_session = True # whenever to recover the previous session
save_session = True # whenever to remember the current session
speak = False # text to speech
listen = False # Speech to text, only for CLI, experimental
jarvis_personality = False # Whenever to use a more &quot;Jarvis&quot; like personality (experimental)
languages = en zh # The list of languages, Text to speech will default to the first language on the list
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = True # leave unchanged unless using CLI on host.
stealth_mode = True # Use undetected selenium to reduce browser detection
```

**Warning**:

- The `config.ini` file format does not support comments. 
Do not copy and paste the example configuration directly, as comments will cause errors.  Instead, manually modify the `config.ini` file with your desired settings, excluding any comments.

- Do *NOT* set provider_name to `openai` if using LM-studio for running LLMs. Set it to `lm-studio`.

- Some provider (eg: lm-studio) require you to have `http://` in front of the IP. For example `http://127.0.0.1:1234`

**List of local providers**

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (set `provider_name` to `lm-studio`)|
| openai    | Yes     |  Use openai compatible API (eg: llama.cpp server)  |

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

*See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you are having issues.*
*If your hardware can&#039;t run LLMs locally, see [Setup to run with an API](#setup-to-run-with-an-api).*
*For detailed `config.ini` explanations, see [Config Section](#config).*

## Setup to run with an API

This setup uses external, cloud-based LLM providers. You&#039;ll need an API key from your chosen service.

**1. Choose an API Provider and Get an API Key:**

Refer to the [List of API Providers](#list-of-api-providers) below. Visit their websites to sign up and obtain an API key.

**2. Set Your API Key as an Environment Variable:**


*   **Linux/macOS:**
    Open your terminal and use the `export` command. It&#039;s best to add this to your shell&#039;s profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) for persistence.
    ```sh
    export PROVIDER_API_KEY=&quot;your_api_key_here&quot; 
    # Replace PROVIDER_API_KEY with the specific variable name, e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY
    ```
    Example for TogetherAI:
    ```sh
    export TOGETHER_API_KEY=&quot;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&quot;
    ```
*   **Windows:**
    *   **Command Prompt (Temporary for current session):**
        ```cmd
        set PROVIDER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    *   **PowerShell (Temporary for current session):**
        ```powershell
        $env:PROVIDER_API_KEY=&quot;your_api_key_here&quot;
        ```
    *   **Permanently:** Search for &quot;environment variables&quot; in the Windows search bar, click &quot;Edit the system environment variables,&quot; then click the &quot;Environment Variables...&quot; button. Add a new User variable with the appropriate name (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and your key as the value.

    *(See FAQ: [How do I set API keys?](#how-do-i-set-api-keys) for more details).*


**3. Update `config.ini`:**
```ini
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = openai # Or google, deepseek, togetherAI, huggingface
provider_model = gpt-3.5-turbo # Or gemini-1.5-flash, deepseek-chat, mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 etc.
provider_server_address = # Typically ignored or can be left blank when is_local = False for most APIs
# ... other settings ...
```
*Warning:* Make sure there are no trailing spaces in the `config.ini` values.

**List of API Providers**

| Provider     | `provider_name` | Local? | Description                                       | API Key Link (Examples)                     |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI       | `openai`        | No     | Use ChatGPT models via OpenAI&#039;s API.              | [platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup) |
| Google Gemini| `google`        | No     | Use Google Gemini models via Google AI Studio.    | [aistudio.google.com/keys](https://aistudio.google.com/keys) |
| Deepseek     | `deepseek`      | No     | Use Deepseek models via their API.                | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com) |
| Hugging Face | `huggingface`   | No     | Use models from Hugging Face Inference API.       | [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) |
| TogetherAI   | `togetherAI`    | No     | Use various open-source models via TogetherAI API.| [api.together.ai/settings/api-keys](https://api.together.ai/settings/api-keys) |
| OpenRouter   | `openrouter`    | No     | Use OpenRouter Models| [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/) |

*Note:*
*   We advise against using `gpt-4o` or other OpenAI models for complex web browsing and task planning as current prompt optimizations are geared towards models like Deepseek.
*   Coding/bash tasks might encounter issues with Gemini, as it may not strictly follow formatting prompts optimized for Deepseek.
*   The `provider_server_address` in `config.ini` is generally not used when `is_local = False` as the API endpoint is usually hardcoded in the respective provider&#039;s library.

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Config** section for detailed config file explanation.*

---

## Start services and Run

By default AgenticSeek is run fully in docker.

**Option 1:** Run in Docker, use web interface:

Start required services. This will start all services from the docker-compose.yml, including:
    - searxng
    - redis (required by searxng)
    - frontend
    - backend (if using `full` when using the web interface)

```sh
./start_services.sh full # MacOS
start start_services.cmd full # Window
```

**Warning:** This step will download and load all Docker images, which may take up to 30 minutes. After starting the services, please wait until the backend service is fully running (you should see **backend: &quot;GET /health HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 OK** in the log) before sending any messages. The backend services might take 5 minute to start on first run.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the web interface.

*Troubleshooting service start:* If these scripts fail, ensure Docker Engine is running and Docker Compose (V2, `docker compose`) is correctly installed. Check the output in the terminal for error messages. See [FAQ: Help! I get an error when running AgenticSeek or its scripts.](#faq-troubleshooting)

**Option 2:** CLI mode:

To run with CLI interface you would have to install package on host:

```sh
./install.sh
./install.bat # windows
```

Then you must change the SEARXNG_BASE_URL in `config.ini` to:

```sh
SEARXNG_BASE_URL=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;
```

Start required services. This will start some services from the docker-compose.yml, including:
    - searxng
    - redis (required by searxng)
    - frontend

```sh
./start_services.sh # MacOS
start start_services.cmd # Window
```

Run: uv run: `uv run python -m ensurepip` to ensure uv has pip enabled.

Use the CLI: `uv run cli.py`


---

## Usage

Make sure the services are up and running with `./start_services.sh full` and go to `localhost:3000` for web interface.

You can also use speech to text by setting `listen = True` in the config. Only for CLI mode.

To exit, simply say/type `goodbye`.

Here are some example usage:

&gt; *Make a snake game in python!*

&gt; *Search the web for top cafes in Rennes, France, and save a list of three with their addresses in rennes_cafes.txt.*

&gt; *Write a Go program to calculate the factorial of a number, save it as factorial.go in your workspace*

&gt; *Search my summer_pictures folder for all JPG files, rename them with today’s date, and save a list of renamed files in photos_list.txt*

&gt; *Search online for popular sci-fi movies from 2024 and pick three to watch tonight. Save the list in movie_night.txt.*

&gt; *Search the web for the latest AI news articles from 2025, select three, and write a Python script to scrape their titles and summaries. Save the script as news_scraper.py and the summaries in ai_news.txt in /home/projects*

&gt; *Friday, search the web for a free stock price API, register with supersuper7434567@gmail.com then write a Python script to fetch using the API daily prices for Tesla, and save the results in stock_prices.csv*

*Note that form filling capabilities are still experimental and might fail.*



After you type your query, AgenticSeek will allocate the best agent for the task.

Because this is an early prototype, the agent routing system might not always allocate the right agent based on your query.

Therefore, you should be very explicit in what you want and how the AI might proceed for example if you want it to conduct a web search, do not say:

`Do you know some good countries for solo-travel?`

Instead, ask:

`Do a web search and find out which are the best country for solo-travel`

---

## **Setup to run the LLM on your own server**  

If you have a powerful computer or a server that you can use, but you want to use it from your laptop you have the options to run the LLM on a remote server using our custom llm server. 

On your &quot;server&quot; that will run the AI model, get the ip address

```sh
ip a | grep &quot;inet &quot; | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1 # local ip
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip # public ip
```

Note: For Windows or macOS, use ipconfig or ifconfig respectively to find the IP address.

Clone the repository and enter the `server/`folder.


```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek/llm_server/
```

Install server specific requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server script.

```sh
python3 app.py --provider ollama --port 3333
```

You have the choice between using `ollama` and `llamacpp` as a LLM service.


Now on your personal computer:

Change the `config.ini` file to set the `provider_name` to `server` and `provider_model` to `deepseek-r1:xxb`.
Set the `provider_server_address` to the ip address of the machine that will run the model.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = server
provider_model = deepseek-r1:70b
provider_server_address = http://x.x.x.x:3333
```


Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

---

## Speech to Text

Warning: speech to text only work in CLI mode at the moment.

Please note that currently speech to text only work in english.

The speech-to-text functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, set the listen option to True in the config.ini file:

```
listen = True
```

When enabled, the speech-to-text feature listens for a trigger keyword, which is the agent&#039;s name, before it begins processing your input. You can customize the agent&#039;s name by updating the `agent_name` value in the *config.ini* file:

```
agent_name = Friday
```

For optimal recognition, we recommend using a common English name like &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Emma&quot; as the agent name

Once you see the transcript start to appear, say the agent&#039;s name aloud to wake it up (e.g., &quot;Friday&quot;).

Speak your query clearly.

End your request with a confirmation phrase to signal the system to proceed. Examples of confirmation phrases include:
```
&quot;do it&quot;, &quot;go ahead&quot;, &quot;execute&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;thanks&quot;, &quot;would ya&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, &quot;okay?&quot;, &quot;proceed&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, &quot;go on&quot;, &quot;do that&quot;, &quot;go it&quot;, &quot;do you understand?&quot;
```

## Config

Example config:
```
[MAIN]
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = http://127.0.0.1:11434 # Example for Ollama; use http://127.0.0.1:1234 for LM-Studio
agent_name = Friday
recover_last_session = False
save_session = False
speak = False
listen = False

jarvis_personality = False
languages = en zh # List of languages for TTS and potentially routing.
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = False
stealth_mode = False
```

**Explanation of `config.ini` Settings**:

*   **`[MAIN]` Section:**
    *   `is_local`: `True` if using a local LLM provider (Ollama, LM-Studio, local OpenAI-compatible server) or the self-hosted server option. `False` if using a cloud-based API (OpenAI, Google, etc.).
    *   `provider_name`: Specifies the LLM provider.
        *   Local options: `ollama`, `lm-studio`, `openai` (for local OpenAI-compatible s

## 👋 hello

**We write your reusable computer vision tools.** Whether you need to load your dataset from your hard drive, draw detections on an image or video, or count how many detections are in a zone. You can count on us! 🤝

## 💻 install

Pip install the supervision package in a
[**Python&gt;=3.9**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install supervision
```

Read more about conda, mamba, and installing from source in our [guide](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/).

## 🔥 quickstart

### models

Supervision was designed to be model agnostic. Just plug in any classification, detection, or segmentation model. For your convenience, we have created [connectors](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/core/#detections) for the most popular libraries like Ultralytics, Transformers, or MMDetection.

```python
import cv2
import supervision as sv
from ultralytics import YOLO

image = cv2.imread(...)
model = YOLO(&quot;yolov8s.pt&quot;)
result = model(image)[0]
detections = sv.Detections.from_ultralytics(result)

len(detections)
# 5
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;👉 more model connectors&lt;/summary&gt;

- inference

  Running with [Inference](https://github.com/roboflow/inference) requires a [Roboflow API KEY](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key).

  ```python
  import cv2
  import supervision as sv
  from inference import get_model

  image = cv2.imread(...)
  model = get_model(model_id=&quot;yolov8s-640&quot;, api_key=&lt;ROBOFLOW API KEY&gt;)
  result = model.infer(image)[0]
  detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(result)

  len(detections)
  # 5
  ```

&lt;/details&gt;

### annotators

Supervision offers a wide range of highly customizable [annotators](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/annotators/), allowing you to compose the perfect visualization for your use case.

```python
import cv2
import supervision as sv

image = cv2.imread(...)
detections = sv.Detections(...)

box_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator()
annotated_frame = box_annotator.annotate(
  scene=image.copy(),
  detections=detections)
```

https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/assets/26109316/691e219c-0565-4403-9218-ab5644f39bce

### datasets

Supervision provides a set of [utils](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/datasets/core/) that allow you to load, split, merge, and save datasets in one of the supported formats.

```python
import supervision as sv
from roboflow import Roboflow

project = Roboflow().workspace(&lt;WORKSPACE_ID&gt;).project(&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;)
dataset = project.version(&lt;PROJECT_VERSION&gt;).download(&quot;coco&quot;)

ds = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(
    images_directory_path=f&quot;{dataset.location}/train&quot;,
    annotations_path=f&quot;{dataset.location}/train/_annotations.coco.json&quot;,
)

path, image, annotation = ds[0]
    # loads image on demand

for path, image, annotation in ds:
    # loads image on demand
```

&lt;details close&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;👉 more dataset utils&lt;/summary&gt;

- load

  ```python
  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...,
      data_yaml_path=...
  )

  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_pascal_voc(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...
  )

  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_path=...
  )
  ```

- split

  ```python
  train_dataset, test_dataset = dataset.split(split_ratio=0.7)
  test_dataset, valid_dataset = test_dataset.split(split_ratio=0.5)

  len(train_dataset), len(test_dataset), len(valid_dataset)
  # (700, 150, 150)
  ```

- merge

  ```python
  ds_1 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)
  len(ds_1)
  # 100
  ds_1.classes
  # [&#039;dog&#039;, &#039;person&#039;]

  ds_2 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)
  len(ds_2)
  # 200
  ds_2.classes
  # [&#039;cat&#039;]

  ds_merged = sv.DetectionDataset.merge([ds_1, ds_2])
  len(ds_merged)
  # 300
  ds_merged.classes
  # [&#039;cat&#039;, &#039;dog&#039;, &#039;person&#039;]
  ```

- save

  ```python
  dataset.as_yolo(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...,
      data_yaml_path=...
  )

  dataset.as_pascal_voc(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...
  )

  dataset.as_coco(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_path=...
  )
  ```

- convert

  ```python
  sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...,
      data_yaml_path=...
  ).as_pascal_voc(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...
  )
  ```

## What Can I Build?

- **Spark Declarative Pipelines** (streaming tables, CDC, SCD Type 2, Auto Loader)
- **Databricks Jobs** (scheduled workflows, multi-task DAGs)
- **AI/BI Dashboards** (visualizations, KPIs, analytics)
- **Unity Catalog** (tables, volumes, governance)
- **Genie Spaces** (natural language data exploration)
- **Knowledge Assistants** (RAG-based document Q&amp;A)
- **MLflow Experiments** (evaluation, scoring, traces)
- **Model Serving** (deploy ML models and AI agents to endpoints)
- **Databricks Apps** (full-stack web applications)
- ...and more

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/) - Command line interface for Databricks
- AI coding environment
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.com)


### Install in existing project
By default this will install at a project level rather than a user level. This is often a good fit, but requires you to run your client from the exact directory that was used for the install.  
_Note: Project configuration files can be re-used in other projects. You find these configs under .claude or .cursor_

#### Mac / Linux

**Basic installation** (uses DEFAULT profile, project scope)

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/main/install.sh)
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Options&lt;/strong&gt; (click to expand)&lt;/summary&gt;

**Global installation with force reinstall**

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/main/install.sh) --global --force
```

**Specify profile and force reinstall**

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/main/install.sh) --profile DEFAULT --force
```

**Install for specific tools only**

```bash
bash &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/main/install.sh) --tools cursor
```

&lt;/details&gt;

**Next steps:** Respond to interactive prompts and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Note: Cursor and Copilot require updating settings manually after install.

#### Windows (PowerShell)

**Basic installation** (uses DEFAULT profile, project scope)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Options&lt;/strong&gt; (click to expand)&lt;/summary&gt;

**Download script first**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
```

**Global installation with force reinstall**

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Global -Force
```

**Specify profile and force reinstall**

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Profile DEFAULT -Force
```

**Install for specific tools only**

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Tools cursor
```

&lt;/details&gt;

**Next steps:** Respond to interactive prompts and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Note: Cursor and Copilot require updating settings manually after install.


### Visual Builder App

Full-stack web application with chat UI for Databricks development:

```bash
cd ai-dev-kit/databricks-builder-app
./scripts/setup.sh
# Follow instructions to start the app
```


### Core Library

Use `databricks-tools-core` directly in your Python projects:

```python
from databricks_tools_core.sql import execute_sql

results = execute_sql(&quot;SELECT * FROM my_catalog.schema.table LIMIT 10&quot;)
```

Works with LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, or any Python framework. See [databricks-tools-core/](databricks-tools-core/) for details.
