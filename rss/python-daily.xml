* Mac OS X (experimental)

# Installation

## Install via requirements.txt

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py 
```

## Install SET
=======
#### Mac OS X
You will need to use a virtual environment for the Python install if you are using an M2 Macbook with the following instructions in your CLI within the social-engineer-toolkit directory. 
```bash
    # to install dependencies, run the following:
    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    # to install SET
    sudo python3 setup.py 
```

&lt;br/&gt;

## Installation
#### Windows 10 WSL/WSL2 Kali Linux
```bash
sudo apt install set -y
```
Kali Linux on Windows 10 is a minimal installation so it doesn&#039;t have any tools installed.
You can easily install Social Engineer Toolkit on WSL/WSL2 without needing pip using the above command.

#### Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/ setoolkit/

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Claude Code Plugins: Orchestration and Automation

&gt; **⚡ Updated for Sonnet 4.5 &amp; Haiku 4.5** — All agents optimized for latest models with hybrid orchestration
&gt;
&gt; **🎯 Agent Skills Enabled** — 47 specialized skills extend Claude&#039;s capabilities across plugins with progressive disclosure

A comprehensive production-ready system combining **85 specialized AI agents**, **15 multi-agent workflow orchestrators**, **47 agent skills**, and **44 development tools** organized into **63 focused, single-purpose plugins** for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

## Overview

This unified repository provides everything needed for intelligent automation and multi-agent orchestration across modern software development:

- **63 Focused Plugins** - Granular, single-purpose plugins optimized for minimal token usage and composability
- **85 Specialized Agents** - Domain experts with deep knowledge across architecture, languages, infrastructure, quality, data/AI, documentation, business operations, and SEO
- **47 Agent Skills** - Modular knowledge packages with progressive disclosure for specialized expertise
- **15 Workflow Orchestrators** - Multi-agent coordination systems for complex operations like full-stack development, security hardening, ML pipelines, and incident response
- **44 Development Tools** - Optimized utilities including project scaffolding, security scanning, test automation, and infrastructure setup

### Key Features

- **Granular Plugin Architecture**: 63 focused plugins optimized for minimal token usage
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: 44 development tools including test generation, scaffolding, and security scanning
- **100% Agent Coverage**: All plugins include specialized agents
- **Agent Skills**: 47 specialized skills following for progressive disclosure and token efficiency
- **Clear Organization**: 23 categories with 1-6 plugins each for easy discovery
- **Efficient Design**: Average 3.4 components per plugin (follows Anthropic&#039;s 2-8 pattern)

### How It Works

Each plugin is completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills:

- **Install only what you need** - Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills
- **Minimal token usage** - No unnecessary resources loaded into context
- **Mix and match** - Compose multiple plugins for complex workflows
- **Clear boundaries** - Each plugin has a single, focused purpose
- **Progressive disclosure** - Skills load knowledge only when activated

**Example**: Installing `python-development` loads 3 Python agents, 1 scaffolding tool, and makes 5 skills available (~300 tokens), not the entire marketplace.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
```

This makes all 63 plugins available for installation, but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.

### Step 2: Install Plugins

Browse available plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

Install the plugins you need:

```bash
# Essential development plugins
/plugin install python-development          # Python with 5 specialized skills
/plugin install javascript-typescript       # JS/TS with 4 specialized skills
/plugin install backend-development         # Backend APIs with 3 architecture skills

# Infrastructure &amp; operations
/plugin install kubernetes-operations       # K8s with 4 deployment skills
/plugin install cloud-infrastructure        # AWS/Azure/GCP with 4 cloud skills

# Security &amp; quality
/plugin install security-scanning           # SAST with security skill
/plugin install code-review-ai             # AI-powered code review

# Full-stack orchestration
/plugin install full-stack-orchestration   # Multi-agent workflows
```

Each installed plugin loads **only its specific agents, commands, and skills** into Claude&#039;s context.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Welcome to Streamlit :wave:

**The fastest way to build and share data apps.**

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app!

![Example of live coding an app in Streamlit|635x380](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/docs/main/public/images/Streamlit_overview.gif)

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
```

Streamlit can also be installed in a virtual environment on [Windows](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-windows), [Mac](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux), and [Linux](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux).

## A little example

Streamlit makes it incredibly easy to build interactive apps:

```python
import streamlit as st

x = st.slider(&#039;Select a value&#039;)
st.write(x, &#039;squared is&#039;, x * x)
```

&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/docs/main/public/images/simple_example.png&quot;/&gt;

## A bigger example

Streamlit&#039;s simple and focused API lets you build incredibly rich and powerful tools.  [This demo project](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving) lets you browse the entire [Udacity self-driving-car dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and run inference in real-time using the [YOLO object detection net](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo).

![Final App Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/docs/main/public/images/complex_app_example.gif)

The complete demo is implemented in less than 300 lines of Python. In fact, the app contains [only 23 Streamlit calls](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/blob/master/streamlit_app.py) which illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit. You can try it right now at [share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-self-driving](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-self-driving).

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; Check out the new [MCP server for Graphiti](mcp_server/README.md)! Give Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients powerful
&gt; Knowledge Graph-based memory.

Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically tailored for AI agents
operating in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti
continuously integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a
coherent, queryable graph. The framework supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical
queries without requiring complete graph recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI
applications.

Use Graphiti to:

- Integrate and maintain dynamic user interactions and business data.

&lt;br /&gt;

A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected facts, such as _&quot;Kendra loves Adidas shoes.&quot;_ Each fact is a &quot;triplet&quot;
represented by two entities, or
nodes (&quot;Kendra&quot;, &quot;Adidas shoes&quot;), and their relationship, or edge (&quot;loves&quot;). Knowledge Graphs have been explored
extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph
while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context.

## Graphiti and Zep&#039;s Context Engineering Platform.

Graphiti powers the core of [Zep](https://www.getzep.com), a turn-key context engineering platform for AI Agents. Zep
offers agent memory, Graph RAG for dynamic data, and context retrieval and assembly.

Using Graphiti, we&#039;ve demonstrated Zep is
the [State of the Art in Agent Memory](https://blog.getzep.com/state-of-the-art-agent-memory/).

Read our paper: [Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956).

We&#039;re excited to open-source Graphiti, believing its potential reaches far beyond AI memory applications.

## Zep vs Graphiti

| Aspect | Zep | Graphiti |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **What they are** | Fully managed platform for context engineering and AI memory | Open-source graph framework |
| **User &amp; conversation management** | Built-in users, threads, and message storage | Build your own |
| **Retrieval &amp; performance** | Pre-configured, production-ready retrieval with sub-200ms performance at scale | Custom implementation required; performance depends on your setup |
| **Developer tools** | Dashboard with graph visualization, debug logs, API logs; SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and Go | Build your own tools |
| **Enterprise features** | SLAs, support, security guarantees | Self-managed |
| **Deployment** | Fully managed or in your cloud | Self-hosted only |

### When to choose which

**Choose Zep** if you want a turnkey, enterprise-grade platform with security, performance, and support baked in.

**Choose Graphiti** if you want a flexible OSS core and you&#039;re comfortable building/operating the surrounding system.

## Why Graphiti?

Traditional RAG approaches often rely on batch processing and static data summarization, making them inefficient for
frequently changing data. Graphiti addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Real-Time Incremental Updates:** Immediate integration of new data episodes without batch recomputation.
- **Bi-Temporal Data Model:** Explicit tracking of event occurrence and ingestion times, allowing accurate point-in-time
  queries.
- **Efficient Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic embeddings, keyword (BM25), and graph traversal to achieve
  low-latency queries without reliance on LLM summarization.
- **Custom Entity Definitions:** Flexible ontology creation and support for developer-defined entities through
  straightforward Pydantic models.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently manages large datasets with parallel processing, suitable for enterprise environments.

Graphiti is specifically designed to address the challenges of dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it
particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time interaction and precise historical queries.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j 5.26 / FalkorDB 1.1.2 / Kuzu 0.11.2 / Amazon Neptune Database Cluster or Neptune Analytics Graph + Amazon
  OpenSearch Serverless collection (serves as the full text search backend)
- OpenAI API key (Graphiti defaults to OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding)

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Graphiti works best with LLM services that support Structured Output (such as OpenAI and Gemini).
&gt; Using other services may result in incorrect output schemas and ingestion failures. This is particularly
&gt; problematic when using smaller models.

Optional:

- Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq API key (for alternative LLM providers)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; The simplest way to install Neo4j is via [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/). It provides a user-friendly
&gt; interface to manage Neo4j instances and databases.
&gt; Alternatively, you can use FalkorDB on-premises via Docker and instantly start with the quickstart example:

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest

```

```bash
pip install graphiti-core
```

or

```bash
uv add graphiti-core
```

### Installing with FalkorDB Support

If you plan to use FalkorDB as your graph database backend, install with the FalkorDB extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordb]
```

### Installing with Kuzu Support

If you plan to use Kuzu as your graph database backend, install with the Kuzu extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[kuzu]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[kuzu]
```

### Installing with Amazon Neptune Support

If you plan to use Amazon Neptune as your graph database backend, install with the Amazon Neptune extra:

```bash
pip install graphiti-core[neptune]

# or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[neptune]
```

### You can also install optional LLM providers as extras:

```bash
# Install with Anthropic support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic]

# Install with Groq support
pip install graphiti-core[groq]

# Install with Google Gemini support
pip install graphiti-core[google-genai]

# Install with multiple providers
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic,groq,google-genai]

# Install with FalkorDB and LLM providers
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb,anthropic,google-genai]

# Install with Amazon Neptune
pip install graphiti-core[neptune]
```

## Default to Low Concurrency; LLM Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors

Graphiti&#039;s ingestion pipelines are designed for high concurrency. By default, concurrency is set low to avoid LLM
Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors. If you find Graphiti slow, please increase concurrency as described below.

Concurrency controlled by the `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` environment variable. By default, `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` is set to `10`
concurrent operations to help prevent `429` rate limit errors from your LLM provider. If you encounter such errors, try
lowering this value.

If your LLM provider allows higher throughput, you can increase `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` to boost episode ingestion
performance.

## Quick Start

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Graphiti defaults to using OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding. Ensure that an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your
&gt; environment.
&gt; Support for Anthropic and Groq LLM inferences is available, too. Other LLM providers may be supported via OpenAI
&gt; compatible APIs.

For a complete working example, see the [Quickstart Example](./examples/quickstart/README.md) in the examples directory.
The quickstart demonstrates:

1. Connecting to a Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, FalkorDB, or Kuzu database
2. Initializing Graphiti indices and constraints
3. Adding episodes to the graph (both text and structured JSON)
4. Searching for relationships (edges) using hybrid search
5. Reranking search results using graph distance
6. Searching for nodes using predefined search recipes

The example is fully documented with clear explanations of each functionality and includes a comprehensive README with
setup instructions and next steps.

### Running with Docker Compose

You can use Docker Compose to quickly start the required services:

- **Neo4j Docker:**
  ```sh
  docker compose up
  ```
  This will start the Neo4j Docker service and related components.

- **FalkorDB Docker:**
  ```sh
  docker compose --profile falkordb up
  ```
  This will start the FalkorDB Docker service and related components.

## MCP Server

The `mcp_server` directory contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Graphiti. This server
allows AI assistants to interact with Graphiti&#039;s knowledge graph capabilities through the MCP protocol.

Key features of the MCP server include:

- Episode management (add, retrieve, delete)
- Entity management and relationship handling
- Semantic and hybrid search capabilities
- Group management for organizing related data
- Graph maintenance operations

The MCP server can be deployed using Docker with Neo4j, making it easy to integrate Graphiti into your AI assistant
workflows.

For detailed setup instructions and usage examples, see the [MCP server README](./mcp_server/README.md).

## REST Service

The `server` directory contains an API service for interacting with the Graphiti API. It is built using FastAPI.

Please see the [server README](./server/README.md) for more information.

## Optional Environment Variables

In addition to the Neo4j and OpenAi-compatible credentials, Graphiti also has a few optional environment variables.
If you are using one of our supported models, such as Anthropic or Voyage models, the necessary environment variables
must be set.

### Database Configuration

Database names are configured directly in the driver constructors:

- **Neo4j**: Database name defaults to `neo4j` (hardcoded in Neo4jDriver)
- **FalkorDB**: Database name defaults to `default_db` (hardcoded in FalkorDriver)

As of v0.17.0, if you need to customize your database configuration, you can instantiate a database driver and pass it
to the Graphiti constructor using the `graph_driver` parameter.

#### Neo4j with Custom Database Name

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neo4j_driver import Neo4jDriver

# Create a Neo4j driver with custom database name
driver = Neo4jDriver(
    uri=&quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    user=&quot;neo4j&quot;,
    password=&quot;password&quot;,
    database=&quot;my_custom_database&quot;  # Custom database name
)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### FalkorDB with Custom Database Name

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.falkordb_driver import FalkorDriver

# Create a FalkorDB driver with custom database name
driver = FalkorDriver(
    host=&quot;localhost&quot;,
    port=6379,
    username=&quot;falkor_user&quot;,  # Optional
    password=&quot;falkor_password&quot;,  # Optional
    database=&quot;my_custom_graph&quot;  # Custom database name
)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### Kuzu

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.kuzu_driver import KuzuDriver

# Create a Kuzu driver
driver = KuzuDriver(db=&quot;/tmp/graphiti.kuzu&quot;)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

#### Amazon Neptune

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neptune_driver import NeptuneDriver

# Create a FalkorDB driver with custom database name
driver = NeptuneDriver(
    host= &lt; NEPTUNE
ENDPOINT &gt;,
aoss_host = &lt; Amazon
OpenSearch
Serverless
Host &gt;,
port = &lt; PORT &gt;  # Optional, defaults to 8182,
         aoss_port = &lt; PORT &gt;  # Optional, defaults to 443
)

driver = NeptuneDriver(host=neptune_uri, aoss_host=aoss_host, port=neptune_port)

# Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver)
```

## Using Graphiti with Azure OpenAI

Graphiti supports Azure OpenAI for both LLM inference and embeddings using Azure&#039;s OpenAI v1 API compatibility layer.

### Quick Start

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.azure_openai_client import AzureOpenAILLMClient
from graphiti_core.llm_client.config import LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.embedder.azure_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbedderClient

# Initialize Azure OpenAI client using the standard OpenAI client
# with Azure&#039;s v1 API endpoint
azure_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    base_url=&quot;https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/&quot;,
    api_key=&quot;your-api-key&quot;,
)

# Create LLM and Embedder clients
llm_client = AzureOpenAILLMClient(
    azure_client=azure_client,
    config=LLMConfig(model=&quot;gpt-5-mini&quot;, small_model=&quot;gpt-5-mini&quot;)  # Your Azure deployment name
)
embedder_client = AzureOpenAIEmbedderClient(
    azure_client=azure_client,
    model=&quot;text-embedding-3-small&quot;  # Your Azure embedding deployment name
)

# Initialize Graphiti with Azure OpenAI clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    &quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    &quot;neo4j&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;,
    llm_client=llm_client,
    embedder=embedder_client,
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Azure OpenAI
```

**Key Points:**
- Use the standard `AsyncOpenAI` client with Azure&#039;s v1 API endpoint format: `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/`
- The deployment names (e.g., `gpt-5-mini`, `text-embedding-3-small`) should match your Azure OpenAI deployment names
- See `examples/azure-openai/` for a complete working example

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials and deployment names.

## Using Graphiti with Google Gemini

Graphiti supports Google&#039;s Gemini models for LLM inference, embeddings, and cross-encoding/reranking. To use Gemini,
you&#039;ll need to configure the LLM client, embedder, and the cross-encoder with your Google API key.

Install Graphiti:

```bash
uv add &quot;graphiti-core[google-genai]&quot;

# or

pip install &quot;graphiti-core[google-genai]&quot;
```

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.gemini_client import GeminiClient, LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.embedder.gemini import GeminiEmbedder, GeminiEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.gemini_reranker_client import GeminiRerankerClient

# Google API key configuration
api_key = &quot;&lt;your-google-api-key&gt;&quot;

# Initialize Graphiti with Gemini clients
graphiti = Graphiti(
    &quot;bolt://localhost:7687&quot;,
    &quot;neo4j&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;,
    llm_client=GeminiClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model=&quot;gemini-2.0-flash&quot;
        )
    ),
    embedder=GeminiEmbedder(
        config=GeminiEmbedderConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            embedding_model=&quot;embedding-001&quot;
        )
    ),
    cross_encoder=GeminiRerankerClient(
        config=LLMConfig(
            api_key=api_key,
            model=&quot;gemini-2.5-flash-lite&quot;
        )
    )
)

# Now you can use Graphiti with Google Gemini for all components
```

The Gemini reranker uses the `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model by default, which is optimized for
cost-effective and low-latency classification tasks. It uses the same boolean classification approach as the OpenAI
reranker, leveraging Gemini&#039;s log probabilities feature to rank passage relevance.

## Using Graphiti with Ollama (Local LLM)

Graphiti supports Ollama for running local LLMs and embedding models via Ollama&#039;s OpenAI-compatible API. This is ideal
for privacy-focused applications or when you want to avoid API costs.

**Note:** Use `OpenAIGenericClient` (not `OpenAIClient`) for Ollama and other OpenAI-compatible providers like LM Studio. The `OpenAIGenericClient` is optimized for local models with a higher default max token limit (16K vs 8K) and full support for structured outputs.

Install the models:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b # LLM
ollama pull nomic-embed-text # embeddings
```

```python
from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.llm_client.config import LLMConfig
from graphiti_core.llm_client.openai_generic_client import OpenAIGenericClient
from graphiti_core.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder, OpenAIEmbedderConfig
from graphiti_core.cross_encoder.openai_reranker_client import OpenAIRerankerClient

# Configure Ollama LLM client
llm_config = LLMConfig(
    api_key=&quot;ollama&quot;,  # Ollama doesn&#039;t require a real API key, but s

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Whisper

[[Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/whisper)
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356)
[[Model card]](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md)
[[Colab example]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/whisper/blob/master/notebooks/LibriSpeech.ipynb)

Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.


## Approach

![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png)

A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.


## Setup

We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI&#039;s tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:

    pip install -U openai-whisper

Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:

    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

It also requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

You may need [`rust`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the `pip install` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. `export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH&quot;`. If the installation fails with `No module named &#039;setuptools_rust&#039;`, you need to install `setuptools_rust`, e.g. by running:

```bash
pip install setuptools-rust
```


## Available models and languages

There are six model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs.
Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model.
The relative speeds below are measured by transcribing English speech on a A100, and the real-world speed may vary significantly depending on many factors including the language, the speaking speed, and the available hardware.

|  Size  | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed |
|:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  tiny  |    39 M    |     `tiny.en`      |       `tiny`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~10x      |
|  base  |    74 M    |     `base.en`      |       `base`       |     ~1 GB     |      ~7x       |
| small  |   244 M    |     `small.en`     |      `small`       |     ~2 GB     |      ~4x       |
| medium |   769 M    |    `medium.en`     |      `medium`      |     ~5 GB     |      ~2x       |
| large  |   1550 M   |        N/A         |      `large`       |    ~10 GB     |       1x       |
| turbo  |   809 M    |        N/A         |      `turbo`       |     ~6 GB     |      ~8x       |

The `.en` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the `tiny.en` and `base.en` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the `small.en` and `medium.en` models.
Additionally, the `turbo` model is an optimized version of `large-v3` that offers faster transcription speed with a minimal degradation in accuracy.

Whisper&#039;s performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of `large-v3` and `large-v2` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3.

![WER breakdown by language](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/266841/f4619d66-1058-4005-8f67-a9d811b77c62)

## Command-line usage

The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the `turbo` model:

```bash
whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model turbo
```

The default setting (which selects the `turbo` model) works well for transcribing English. However, **the `turbo` model is not trained for translation tasks**. If you need to **translate non-English speech into English**, use one of the **multilingual models** (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`) instead of `turbo`. 

For example, to transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language:

```bash
whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese
```

To **translate** speech into English, use:

```bash
whisper japanese.wav --model medium --language Japanese --task translate
```

&gt; **Note:** The `turbo` model will return the original language even if `--task translate` is specified. Use `medium` or `large` for the best translation results.

Run the following to view all available options:

```bash
whisper --help
```

See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages.


## Python usage

Transcription can also be performed within Python: 

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model(&quot;turbo&quot;)
result = model.transcribe(&quot;audio.mp3&quot;)
print(result[&quot;text&quot;])
```

Internally, the `transcribe()` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window.

Below is an example usage of `whisper.detect_language()` and `whisper.decode()` which provide lower-level access to the model.

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model(&quot;turbo&quot;)

# load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds
audio = whisper.load_audio(&quot;audio.mp3&quot;)
audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)

# make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model
mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio, n_mels=model.dims.n_mels).to(model.device)

# detect the spoken language
_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)
print(f&quot;Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}&quot;)

# decode the audio
options = whisper.DecodingOptions()
result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)

# print the recognized text
print(result.text)
```

The brand name ERPNext and the logo are trademarks of Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

### Introduction

Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Frappe) owns and oversees the trademarks for the ERPNext name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the ERPNext name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve ERPNext.
- We’d like to make it clear how ERPNext-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the ERPNext name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the ERPNext name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official ERPNext resources.

### Frappe Trademark Usage Policy

Permission from Frappe is required to use the ERPNext name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the ERPNext name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the ERPNext software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which ERPNext is distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the ERPNext name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use ERPNext as part of a domain name.

Use of the ERPNext name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other ERPNext-related businesses or projects can use the ERPNext name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by ERPNext or Frappe Technologies or the ERPNext open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering ERPNext consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The ERPNext Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the ERPNext logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use ERPNext as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around ERPNext. We encourage ERPNext-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

## Get started

Install LangGraph:

```
pip install -U langgraph
```

Then, create an agent [using prebuilt components](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/):

```python
# pip install -qU &quot;langchain[anthropic]&quot; to call the model

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -&gt; str:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Get weather for a given city.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return f&quot;It&#039;s always sunny in {city}!&quot;

agent = create_react_agent(
    model=&quot;anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest&quot;,
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt=&quot;You are a helpful assistant&quot;
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;what is the weather in sf&quot;}]}
)
```

For more information, see the [Quickstart](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/agents/). Or, to learn how to build an [agent workflow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/) with a customizable architecture, long-term memory, and other complex task handling, see the [LangGraph basics tutorials](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/1-build-basic-chatbot/).

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

- [Durable execution](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/durable_execution/): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
- [Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/): Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
- [Comprehensive memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/): Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
- [Debugging with LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
- [Production-ready deployment](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph’s ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

- [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
- [LangSmith Deployment](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_platform/) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/).
- [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview) – Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Looking for the JS version of LangGraph? See the [JS repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs) and the [JS docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># MarkItDown

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/markitdown.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)
![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/markitdown)
[![Built by AutoGen Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-AutoGen%20Team-blue)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0:
&gt; * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;` to have backward-compatible behavior. 
&gt; * convert\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO.
&gt; * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. *No temporary files are created anymore*. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.

MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.

MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:

- PDF
- PowerPoint
- Word
- Excel
- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)
- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- HTML
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP files (iterates over contents)
- Youtube URLs
- EPubs
- ... and more!

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still
provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as
OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4o, natively &quot;_speak_&quot; Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their
responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of
Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions
are also highly token-efficient.

## Prerequisites
MarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use &#039;uv pip install&#039; rather than just &#039;pip install&#039; to install packages in this virtual environment
```

If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown
```

## Installation

To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install &#039;markitdown[all]&#039;`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git
cd markitdown
pip install -e &#039;packages/markitdown[all]&#039;
```

## Usage

### Command-Line

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf &gt; document.md
```

Or use `-o` to specify the output file:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md
```

You can also pipe content:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

### Optional Dependencies
MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:

```bash
pip install &#039;markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]&#039;
```

will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:

* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies
* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files
* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files
* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files
* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files
* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files
* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages
* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence
* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files
* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription

### Plugins

MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins
```

To enable plugins use:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf
```

To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.

### Azure Document Intelligence

To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e &quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;
```

More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)

### Python API

Basic usage in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert(&quot;test.xlsx&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

Document Intelligence conversion in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=&quot;&lt;document_intelligence_endpoint&gt;&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;test.pdf&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

To use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;, llm_prompt=&quot;optional custom prompt&quot;)
result = md.convert(&quot;example.jpg&quot;)
print(result.text_content)
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t markitdown:latest .
docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest &lt; ~/your-file.pdf &gt; output.md
```

**A Python package for segmenting geospatial data with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)**

## Introduction

The **segment-geospatial** package draws its inspiration from [segment-anything-eo](https://github.com/aliaksandr960/segment-anything-eo) repository authored by [Aliaksandr Hancharenka](https://github.com/aliaksandr960). To facilitate the use of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for geospatial data, I have developed the [segment-anything-py](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-anything) and [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial) Python packages, which are now available on PyPI and conda-forge. My primary objective is to simplify the process of leveraging SAM for geospatial data analysis by enabling users to achieve this with minimal coding effort. I have adapted the source code of segment-geospatial from the [segment-anything-eo](https://github.com/aliaksandr960/segment-anything-eo) repository, and credit for its original version goes to Aliaksandr Hancharenka.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

**segment-geospatial** is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/segment-geospatial/) and can be installed in several ways so that its dependencies can be controlled more granularly. This reduces package size for CI environments, since not every time all of the models will be used.

Depending on what tools you need to use, you might want to do:
* `segment-geospatial` or `segment-geospatial[samgeo]`: Installs only the minimum required dependencies to run SAMGeo
* `segment-geospatial[samgeo2]`: Installs the dependencies to run SAMGeo 2
* `segment-geospatial[fast]`: Installs the dependencies to run Fast SAM
* `segment-geospatial[hq]`: Installs the dependencies to run HQ-SAM
* `segment-geospatial[text]`: Installs Grounding DINO to use SAMGeo 1 and 2 with text prompts
* `segment-geospatial[fer]`: Installs the dependencies to run the feature
edge reconstruction algorithm

Additionally, these other two optional imports are defined:
* `segment-geospatial[all]`: Installs the dependencies to run all of the SAMGeo models
* `segment-geospatial[extra]`: Installs the dependencies to run all of the SAMGeo models and other utilities to run the examples like Jupyter notebook support, `leafmap`, etc.

Simply running the following should install the dependencies for each use case:

```bash
pip install segment-geospatial[samgeo2] # Or any other choice of the above
```
To see more in detail what packages come with each choice, please refer to `pyproject.toml`.


### Install from conda-forge

**segment-geospatial** is also available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/segment-geospatial). If you have
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your computer, you can install segment-geospatial using the following commands. It is recommended to create a fresh conda environment for **segment-geospatial**. The following commands will create a new conda environment named `geo` and install **segment-geospatial** and its dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n geo python
conda activate geo
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge segment-geospatial
```

If your system has a GPU, but the above commands do not install the GPU version of pytorch, you can force the installation of the GPU version of pytorch using the following command:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge segment-geospatial &quot;pytorch=*=cuda*&quot;
```

Samgeo-geospatial has some optional dependencies that are not included in the default conda environment. To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge groundingdino-py segment-anything-fast
```

      &lt;/summary&gt; 
        The end-to-end NVIDIA Cosmos platform accelerates world model development for physical AI systems. Built on CUDA, Cosmos combines state-of-the-art world foundation models, video tokenizers, and AI-accelerated data processing pipelines. Developers can accelerate world model development by fine-tuning Cosmos world foundation models or building new ones from the ground up. These models create realistic synthetic videos of environments and interactions, providing a scalable foundation for training complex systems, from simulating humanoid robots performing advanced actions to developing end-to-end autonomous driving models. 
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt; (2025-01-07)
      &lt;/summary&gt;
        The NeMo Framework now supports training and customizing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos&quot;&gt;NVIDIA Cosmos&lt;/a&gt; collection of world foundation models. Cosmos leverages advanced text-to-world generation techniques to create fluid, coherent video content from natural language prompts.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        You can also now accelerate your video processing step using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-curator-video-processing-early-access&quot;&gt;NeMo Curator&lt;/a&gt; library, which provides optimized video processing and captioning features that can deliver up to 89x faster video processing when compared to an unoptimized CPU pipeline.

        &lt;/a&gt; (2024-11-06)
      &lt;/summary&gt;
        NVIDIA recently announced significant enhancements to the NeMo platform, focusing on multimodal generative AI models. The update includes NeMo Curator and the Cosmos tokenizer, which streamline the data curation process and enhance the quality of visual data. These tools are designed to handle large-scale data efficiently, making it easier to develop high-quality AI models for various applications, including robotics and autonomous driving. The Cosmos tokenizers, in particular, efficiently map visual data into compact, semantic tokens, which is crucial for training large-scale generative models. The tokenizer is available now on the &lt;a href=http://github.com/NVIDIA/cosmos-tokenizer/NVIDIA/cosmos-tokenizer&gt;NVIDIA/cosmos-tokenizer&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repo and on &lt;a href=https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Tokenizer-CV8x8x8&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt;.

## Introduction

NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a scalable and cloud-native generative AI
framework built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Large
Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV)
domains. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and
deploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and
pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).

## What&#039;s New in NeMo 2.0

NVIDIA NeMo 2.0 introduces several significant improvements over its predecessor, NeMo 1.0, enhancing flexibility, performance, and scalability.

- **Python-Based Configuration** - NeMo 2.0 transitions from YAML files to a Python-based configuration, providing more flexibility and control. This shift makes it easier to extend and customize configurations programmatically.

- **Modular Abstractions** - By adopting PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, NeMo 2.0 simplifies adaptation and experimentation. This modular approach allows developers to more easily modify and experiment with different components of their models.

- **Scalability** - NeMo 2.0 seamlessly scaling large-scale experiments across thousands of GPUs using [NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run), a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution, and management of machine learning experiments across computing environments.

Overall, these enhancements make NeMo 2.0 a powerful, scalable, and user-friendly framework for AI model development.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]  
&gt; NeMo 2.0 is currently supported by the LLM (large language model) and VLM (vision language model) collections.

### Get Started with Cosmos

NeMo Curator and NeMo Framework support video curation and post-training of the Cosmos World Foundation Models, which are open and available on [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/cosmos/collections/cosmos) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-6751e884dc10e013a0a0d8e6). For more information on video datasets, refer to [NeMo Curator](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-curator). To post-train World Foundation Models using the NeMo Framework for your custom physical AI tasks, see the [Cosmos Diffusion models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos/blob/main/cosmos1/models/diffusion/nemo/post_training/README.md) and the [Cosmos Autoregressive models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos/blob/main/cosmos1/models/autoregressive/nemo/post_training/README.md).

## LLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization

All NeMo models are trained with
[Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning). Training is
automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs. You can check the performance benchmarks using the
latest NeMo Framework container [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/performance/performance_summary.html).

When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training
techniques, incorporating [parallelism
strategies](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modeloverview.html)
to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques
include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully
Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed
Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.

NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize [NVIDIA Transformer
Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) for FP8 training on
NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging [NVIDIA Megatron
Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) for
scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM,
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF). See [NVIDIA NeMo
Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner) for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the
latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA,
P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/sft_peft/index.html)
for the full list of supported models and techniques.

## LLMs and MMs Deployment and Optimization

NeMo LLMs and MMs can be deployed and optimized with [NVIDIA NeMo
Microservices](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access).

## Speech AI

NeMo ASR and TTS models can be optimized for inference and deployed for
production use cases with [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva).
