# La Suite Docs : Collaborative Text Editing
Docs, where your notes can become knowledge through live collaboration.

&lt;img src=&quot;/docs/assets/docs_live_collaboration_light.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;

## Why use Docs ❓
Docs is a collaborative text editor designed to address common challenges in knowledge building and sharing.

### Write
* 😌 Get simple, accessible online editing for your team.
* 💅 Create clean documents with beautiful formatting options.
* 🖌️ Focus on your content using either the in-line editor, or [the Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* 🧱 Quickly design your page thanks to the many block types, accessible from the `/` slash commands, as well as keyboard shortcuts.
* 🔌 Write offline! Your edits will be synced once you&#039;re back online.
* ✨ Save time thanks to our AI actions, such as rephrasing, summarizing, fixing typos, translating, etc. You can even turn your selected text into a prompt!

### Work together
* 🤝 Enjoy live editing! See your team collaborate in real time.
* 🔒 Keep your information secure thanks to granular access control. Only share with the right people.
* 📑 Export your content in multiple formats (`.odt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) with customizable templates.
* 📚 Turn your team&#039;s collaborative work into organized knowledge with Subpages.

### Self-host

#### 🚀 Docs is easy to install on your own servers
We use Kubernetes for our [production instance](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/) but also support Docker Compose. The community contributed a couple other methods (Nix, YunoHost etc.) check out the [docs](/docs/installation/README.md) to get detailed instructions and examples.

#### 🌍 Known instances
We hope to see many more, here is an incomplete list of public Docs instances. Feel free to make a PR to add ones that are not listed below🙏

| Url | Org | Public |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| [docs.numerique.gouv.fr](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/)    | DINUM    | French public agents working for the central administration and the extended public sphere. ProConnect is required to login in or sign up|
| [docs.suite.anct.gouv.fr](https://docs.suite.anct.gouv.fr/)    | ANCT    | French public agents working for the territorial administration and the extended public sphere. ProConnect is required to login in or sign up|
| [notes.demo.opendesk.eu](https://notes.demo.opendesk.eu)    | ZenDiS    | Demo instance of OpenDesk. Request access to get credentials |
| [notes.liiib.re](https://notes.liiib.re/)    | lasuite.coop    | Free and open demo to all. Content and accounts are reset after one month |
| [docs.federated.nexus](https://docs.federated.nexus/)    | federated.nexus    | Public instance, but you have to [sign up for a Federated Nexus account](https://federated.nexus/register/). |
| [docs.demo.mosacloud.eu](https://docs.demo.mosacloud.eu/)    | mosa.cloud    | Demo instance of mosa.cloud, a dutch company providing services around La Suite apps. |

#### ⚠️ Advanced features
For some advanced features (ex: Export as PDF) Docs relies on XL packages from BlockNote. These are licenced under GPL and are not MIT compatible. You can perfectly use Docs without these packages by setting the environment variable `PUBLISH_AS_MIT` to true. That way you&#039;ll build an image of the application without the features that are not MIT compatible. Read the [environment variables documentation](/docs/env.md) for more information.

## Getting started 🔧

### Test it

You can test Docs on your browser by visiting this [demo document](https://impress-preprod.beta.numerique.gouv.fr/docs/6ee5aac4-4fb9-457d-95bf-bb56c2467713/)

### Run Docs locally

&gt; ⚠️ The methods described below for running Docs locally is **for testing purposes only**. It is based on building Docs using [Minio](https://min.io/) as an S3-compatible storage solution. Of course you can choose any S3-compatible storage solution.

**Prerequisite**

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop, then type:

```shellscript
$ docker -v

Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61

$ docker compose version

Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```

&gt; ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with `sudo`, but this can be avoided by adding your user to the local `docker` group.

**Project bootstrap**

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

```shellscript
$ make bootstrap FLUSH_ARGS=&#039;--no-input&#039;
```

This command builds the `app-dev` and `frontend-dev` containers, installs dependencies, performs database migrations and compiles translations. It&#039;s a good idea to use this command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid dependency-related or migration-related issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running 🎉

You can access the project by going to &lt;http://localhost:3000&gt;.

You will be prompted to log in. The default credentials are:

```
username: impress
password: impress
```

📝 Note that if you need to run them afterwards, you can use the eponymous Make rule:

```shellscript
$ make run
```

⚠️ For the frontend developer, it is often better to run the frontend in development mode locally.

To do so, install the frontend dependencies with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make frontend-development-install
```

And run the frontend locally in development mode with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-frontend-development
```

To start all the services, except the frontend container, you can use the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-backend
```

To execute frontend tests &amp; linting only
```shellscript
$ make frontend-test
$ make frontend-lint
```

**Adding content**

You can create a basic demo site by running this command:

```shellscript
$ make demo
```

Finally, you can check all available Make rules using this command:

```shellscript
$ make help
```

**Django admin**

You can access the Django admin site at:

&lt;http://localhost:8071/admin&gt;.

You first need to create a superuser account:

```shellscript
$ make superuser
```

&lt;/p&gt;

## Installation (Manual)

**Please be aware that the installation requires technical skills and is not for beginners. Consider downloading the quickstart version.**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Click to see the process&lt;/summary&gt;

### Installation

This is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.

**1. Set up Your Platform**

-   Python (3.11 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```
-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git
cd Deep-Live-Cam
```

**3. Download the Models**

1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Place these files in the &quot;**models**&quot; folder.

**4. Install Dependencies**

We highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.


For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Linux:
```bash
# Ensure you use the installed Python 3.10
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For macOS:**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:

```bash
# Install Python 3.11 (specific version is important)
brew install python@3.11

# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)
brew install python-tk@3.10

# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
rm -rf venv

# Reinstall the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies again
pip install -r requirements.txt

# gfpgan and basicsrs issue fix
pip install git+https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.git@master
pip uninstall gfpgan -y
pip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git@master
```

**Run:** If you don&#039;t have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).

### GPU Acceleration

**Important Notes for macOS:**
- You **must** use Python 3.10, not newer versions like 3.11 or 3.13
- Always run with `python3.10` command not just `python` if you have multiple Python versions installed
- If you get error about `_tkinter` missing, reinstall the tkinter package: `brew reinstall python-tk@3.10`
- If you get model loading errors, check that your models are in the correct folder
- If you encounter conflicts with other Python versions, consider uninstalling them:
  ```bash
  # List all installed Python versions
  brew list | grep python
  
  # Uninstall conflicting versions if needed
  brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies python@3.11 python@3.13
  
  # Keep only Python 3.11
  brew cleanup
  ```

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 初次安装遇到问题请查阅 [💬 FAQ问题集合](https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/99) ，一般遇到的问题都已经有解决办法。

## 👋 最简配置运行

已经支持在 web 页面配置其他参数，docker 启动命令如下:

```bash
docker run -p 58090:8090 -e XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT=58090 -v /xiaomusic_music:/app/music -v /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf hanxi/xiaomusic
```

🔥 国内：

```bash
docker run -p 58090:8090 -e XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT=58090 -v /xiaomusic_music:/app/music -v /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf docker.hanxi.cc/hanxi/xiaomusic
```

对应的 docker compose 配置如下：

```yaml
services:
  xiaomusic:
    image: hanxi/xiaomusic
    container_name: xiaomusic
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 58090:8090
    environment:
      XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT: 58090
    volumes:
      - /xiaomusic_music:/app/music
      - /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf
```

🔥 国内：

```yaml
services:
  xiaomusic:
    image: docker.hanxi.cc/hanxi/xiaomusic
    container_name: xiaomusic
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 58090:8090
    environment:
      XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT: 58090
    volumes:
      - /xiaomusic_music:/app/music
      - /xiaomusic_conf:/app/conf
```

- 其中 conf 目录为配置文件存放目录，music 目录为音乐存放目录，建议分开配置为不同的目录。
- /xiaomusic_music 和 /xiaomusic_conf 是 docker 所在的主机的目录，可以修改为其他目录。如果报错找不到 /xiaomusic_music 目录，可以先执行 `mkdir -p /xiaomusic_{music,conf}` 命令新建目录。
- /app/music 和 /app/conf 是 docker 容器里的目录，不要去修改。
- XIAOMUSIC_PUBLIC_PORT 是用来配置 NAS 本地端口的。8090 是容器端口，不要去修改。
- 后台访问地址为： http://NAS_IP:58090

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; docker 和 docker compose 二选一即可，启动成功后，在 web 页面可以配置其他参数，带有 `*` 号的配置是必须要配置的，其他的用不上时不用修改。初次配置时需要在页面上输入小米账号和密码保存后才能获取到设备列表。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 目前安装步骤已经是最简化了，如果还是嫌安装麻烦，可以微信或者 QQ 约我远程安装，我一般周末和晚上才有时间，需要赞助个辛苦费 :moneybag: 50 元一次。

遇到问题可以去 web 设置页面底部点击【下载日志文件】按钮，然后搜索一下日志文件内容确保里面没有账号密码信息后(有就删除这些敏感信息)，然后在提 issues 反馈问题时把下载的日志文件带上。

### 🤐 支持语音口令

- 【播放歌曲】，播放本地的歌曲
- 【播放歌曲+歌名】，比如：播放歌曲周杰伦晴天
- 【上一首】
- 【下一首】
- 【单曲循环】
- 【全部循环】
- 【随机播放】
- 【关机】，【停止播放】，两个效果是一样的。
- 【刷新列表】，当复制了歌曲进 music 目录后，可以用这个口令刷新歌单。
- 【播放列表+列表名】，比如：播放列表其他。
- 【加入收藏】，把当前播放的歌曲加入收藏歌单。
- 【取消收藏】，把当前播放的歌曲从收藏歌单里移除。
- 【播放列表收藏】，这个用于播放收藏歌单。
- ~【播放本地歌曲+歌名】，这个口令和播放歌曲的区别是本地找不到也不会去下载。~
- 【播放列表第几个+列表名】，具体见： &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/158&gt;
- 【搜索播放+关键词】，会搜索关键词作为临时搜索列表播放，比如说【搜索播放林俊杰】，会播放所有林俊杰的歌。
- 【本地搜索播放+关键词】，跟搜索播放的区别是本地找不到也不会去下载。

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 隐藏玩法: 对小爱同学说播放歌曲小猪佩奇的故事，会先下载小猪佩奇的故事，然后再播放小猪佩奇的故事。

## 🛠️ pip 方式安装运行

```shell
&gt; pip install -U xiaomusic
&gt; xiaomusic --help
 __  __  _                   __  __                 _
 \ \/ / (_)   __ _    ___   |  \/  |  _   _   ___  (_)   ___
  \  /  | |  / _` |  / _ \  | |\/| | | | | | / __| | |  / __|
  /  \  | | | (_| | | (_) | | |  | | | |_| | \__ \ | | | (__
 /_/\_\ |_|  \__,_|  \___/  |_|  |_|  \__,_| |___/ |_|  \___|
          XiaoMusic v0.3.69 by: github.com/hanxi

usage: xiaomusic [-h] [--port PORT] [--hardware HARDWARE] [--account ACCOUNT]
                 [--password PASSWORD] [--cookie COOKIE] [--verbose]
                 [--config CONFIG] [--ffmpeg_location FFMPEG_LOCATION]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --port PORT           监听端口
  --hardware HARDWARE   小爱音箱型号
  --account ACCOUNT     xiaomi account
  --password PASSWORD   xiaomi password
  --cookie COOKIE       xiaomi cookie
  --verbose             show info
  --config CONFIG       config file path
  --ffmpeg_location FFMPEG_LOCATION
                        ffmpeg bin path
&gt; xiaomusic --config config.json
```

其中 `config.json` 文件可以参考 `config-example.json` 文件配置。见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/94&gt;

不修改默认端口 8090 的情况下，只需要执行 `xiaomusic` 即可启动。

## 🔩 开发环境运行

- 使用 install_dependencies.sh 下载依赖
- 使用 pdm 安装环境
- 默认监听了端口 8090 , 使用其他端口自行修改。

```shell
pdm run xiaomusic.py
````

如果是开发前端界面，可以通过 &lt;http://localhost:8090/docs&gt;
查看有什么接口。目前的 web 控制台非常简陋，欢迎有兴趣的朋友帮忙实现一个漂亮的前端，需要什么接口可以随时提需求。

### 🚦 代码提交规范

提交前请执行

```
pdm lintfmt
```

用于检查代码和格式化代码。

### 本地编译 Docker Image

```shell
docker build -t xiaomusic .
```

### 技术栈

- 后端代码使用 Python 语言编写。
- HTTP 服务使用的是 FastAPI 框架，~~早期版本使用的是 Flask~~。
- 使用了 Docker ，在 NAS 上安装更方便。
- 默认的前端主题使用了 jQuery 。

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 如果你的设备支持播放，请反馈给我添加到支持列表里，谢谢。
&gt; 目前应该所有设备类型都已经支持播放，有问题随时反馈。
&gt; 其他触屏版不能播放可以设置【型号兼容模式】选项为 true 试试。见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/30&gt;

## 🎵 支持音乐格式

- mp3
- flac
- wav
- ape
- ogg
- m4a

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 本地音乐会搜索目录下上面格式的文件，下载的歌曲是 mp3 格式的。
&gt; 已知 L05B L05C LX06 L16A 不支持 flac 格式。
&gt; 如果格式不能播放可以打开【转换为MP3】和【型号兼容模式】选项。具体见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/153#issuecomment-2328168689&gt;

## 🌏 网络歌单功能

可以配置一个 json 格式的歌单，支持电台和歌曲，也可以直接用别人分享的链接，同时配备了 m3u 文件格式转换工具，可以很方便的把 m3u 电台文件转换成网络歌单格式的 json 文件，具体用法见  &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/78&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; 欢迎有想法的朋友们制作更多的歌单转换工具。

## 🍺 更多其他可选配置

见 &lt;https://github.com/hanxi/xiaomusic/issues/333&gt;

## ⚠️ 安全提醒

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt;
&gt; 1. 如果配置了公网访问 xiaomusic ，请一定要开启密码登陆，并设置复杂的密码。且不要在公共场所的 WiFi 环境下使用，否则可能造成小米账号密码泄露。
&gt; 2. 强烈不建议将小爱音箱的小米账号绑定摄像头，代码难免会有 bug ，一旦小米账号密码泄露，可能监控录像也会泄露。

## ⚡ 项目概述

“**微舆**” 是一个从0实现的创新型 多智能体 舆情分析系统，帮助大家破除信息茧房，还原舆情原貌，预测未来走向，辅助决策。用户只需像聊天一样提出分析需求，智能体开始全自动分析 国内外30+主流社媒 与 数百万条大众评论。

&gt; “微舆”谐音“微鱼”，BettaFish是一种体型很小但非常好斗、漂亮的鱼，它象征着“小而强大，不畏挑战”

查看系统以“武汉大学舆情”为例，生成的研究报告：[武汉大学品牌声誉深度分析报告](./final_reports/final_report__20250827_131630.html)

不仅仅体现在报告质量上，相比同类产品，我们拥有🚀六大优势：

1. **AI驱动的全域监控**：AI爬虫集群7x24小时不间断作业，全面覆盖微博、小红书、抖音、快手等10+国内外关键社媒。不仅实时捕获热点内容，更能下钻至海量用户评论，让您听到最真实、最广泛的大众声音。

2. **超越LLM的复合分析引擎**：我们不仅依赖设计的5类专业Agent，更融合了微调模型、统计模型等中间件。通过多模型协同工作，确保了分析结果的深度、准度与多维视角。

3. **强大的多模态能力**：突破图文限制，能深度解析抖音、快手等短视频内容，并精准提取现代搜索引擎中的天气、日历、股票等结构化多模态信息卡片，让您全面掌握舆情动态。

4. **Agent“论坛”协作机制**：为不同Agent赋予独特的工具集与思维模式，引入辩论主持人模型，通过“论坛”机制进行链式思维碰撞与辩论。这不仅避免了单一模型的思维局限与交流导致的同质化，更催生出更高质量的集体智能与决策支持。

5. **公私域数据无缝融合**：平台不仅分析公开舆情，还提供高安全性的接口，支持您将内部业务数据库与舆情数据无缝集成。打通数据壁垒，为垂直业务提供“外部趋势+内部洞察”的强大分析能力。

## 🚀 快速开始

&gt; 如果你是初次学习一个Agent系统的搭建，可以从一个非常简单的demo开始：[Deep Search Agent Demo](https://github.com/666ghj/DeepSearchAgent-Demo)

### 环境要求

- **操作系统**: Windows、Linux、MacOS
- **Python版本**: 3.9+
- **Conda**: Anaconda或Miniconda
- **数据库**: MySQL（可选择我们的云数据库服务）
- **内存**: 建议2GB以上

### 1. 创建Conda环境

```bash
# 创建conda环境
conda create -n your_conda_name python=3.11
conda activate your_conda_name
```

### 2. 安装依赖包

```bash
# 基础依赖安装
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 如果不想使用本地情感分析模型（算力需求很小，默认安装cpu版本），可以将该文件中的“机器学习”部分注释掉再执行指令
```

### 3. 安装Playwright浏览器驱动

```bash
# 安装浏览器驱动（用于爬虫功能）
playwright install chromium
```

### 4. 配置系统

#### 4.1 配置API密钥

编辑 `config.py` 文件，填入您的API密钥（您也可以选择自己的模型、搜索代理，详情见config文件内）：

```python
# MySQL数据库配置
DB_HOST = &quot;localhost&quot;
DB_PORT = 3306
DB_USER = &quot;your_username&quot;
DB_PASSWORD = &quot;your_password&quot;
DB_NAME = &quot;your_db_name&quot;
DB_CHARSET = &quot;utf8mb4&quot;

# LLM配置
# 您可以更改每个部分LLM使用的API，只要兼容OpenAI请求格式都可以

# Insight Agent
INSIGHT_ENGINE_API_KEY = &quot;your_api_key&quot;
INSIGHT_ENGINE_BASE_URL = &quot;https://api.moonshot.cn/v1&quot;
INSIGHT_ENGINE_MODEL_NAME = &quot;kimi-k2-0711-preview&quot;
# Media Agent
...
```

#### 4.2 数据库初始化

**选择1：使用本地数据库**

&gt; MindSpider爬虫系统跟舆情系统是各自独立的，所以需要再去`MindSpider\config.py`配置一下

```bash
# 本地MySQL数据库初始化
cd MindSpider
python schema/init_database.py
```

**选择2：使用云数据库服务（推荐）**

我们提供便捷的云数据库服务，包含日均10万+真实舆情数据，目前**免费申请**！

- 真实舆情数据，实时更新
- 多维度标签分类
- 高可用云端服务
- 专业技术支持

**联系我们申请免费云数据库访问：📧 670939375@qq.com**

&gt; 为进行数据合规性审查与服务升级，云数据库自2025年10月1日起暂停接收新的使用申请

### 5. 启动系统

#### 5.1 完整系统启动（推荐）

```bash
# 在项目根目录下，激活conda环境
conda activate your_conda_name

# 启动主应用即可
python app.py
```

&gt; 注1：一次运行终止后，streamlit app可能结束异常仍然占用端口，此时搜索占用端口的进程kill掉即可

&gt; 注2：数据爬取需要单独操作，见5.3指引

&gt; 注3：如果服务器远程部署出现页面显示问题，见[PR#45](https://github.com/666ghj/BettaFish/pull/45)

访问 http://localhost:5000 即可使用完整系统

#### 5.2 单独启动某个Agent

```bash
# 启动QueryEngine
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/query_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8503

# 启动MediaEngine  
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/media_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502

# 启动InsightEngine
streamlit run SingleEngineApp/insight_engine_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
```

#### 5.3 爬虫系统单独使用

这部分有详细的配置文档：[MindeSpider使用说明](./MindSpider/README.md)

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MindSpider\img\example.png&quot; alt=&quot;banner&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;

MindSpider 运行示例
&lt;/div&gt;

```bash
# 进入爬虫目录
cd MindSpider

# 项目初始化
python main.py --setup

# 运行完整爬虫流程
python main.py --complete --date 2024-01-20

# 仅运行话题提取
python main.py --broad-topic --date 2024-01-20

# 仅运行深度爬取
python main.py --deep-sentiment --platforms xhs dy wb
```

## ⚙️ 高级配置

### 修改关键参数

#### Agent配置参数

每个Agent都有专门的配置文件，可根据需求调整，下面是部分示例：

```python
# QueryEngine/utils/config.py
class Config:
    max_reflections = 2           # 反思轮次
    max_search_results = 15       # 最大搜索结果数
    max_content_length = 8000     # 最大内容长度
    
# MediaEngine/utils/config.py  
class Config:
    comprehensive_search_limit = 10  # 综合搜索限制
    web_search_limit = 15           # 网页搜索限制
    
# InsightEngine/utils/config.py
class Config:
    default_search_topic_globally_limit = 200    # 全局搜索限制
    default_get_comments_limit = 500             # 评论获取限制
    max_search_results_for_llm = 50              # 传给LLM的最大结果数
```

#### 情感分析模型配置

```python
# InsightEngine/tools/sentiment_analyzer.py
SENTIMENT_CONFIG = {
    &#039;model_type&#039;: &#039;multilingual&#039;,     # 可选: &#039;bert&#039;, &#039;multilingual&#039;, &#039;qwen&#039;等
    &#039;confidence_threshold&#039;: 0.8,      # 置信度阈值
    &#039;batch_size&#039;: 32,                 # 批处理大小
    &#039;max_sequence_length&#039;: 512,       # 最大序列长度
}
```

### 接入不同的LLM模型

支持任意openAI调用格式的LLM提供商，只需要在/config.py中填写对应的KEY、BASE_URL、MODEL_NAME即可。

&gt; 什么是openAI调用格式？下面提供一个简单的例子：
&gt;```python
&gt;from openai import OpenAI
&gt;
&gt;client = OpenAI(api_key=&quot;your_api_key&quot;, 
&gt;                base_url=&quot;https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1&quot;)
&gt;
&gt;response = client.chat.completions.create(
&gt;    model=&quot;Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct&quot;,
&gt;    messages=[
&gt;        {&#039;role&#039;: &#039;user&#039;, 
&gt;         &#039;content&#039;: &quot;推理模型会给市场带来哪些新的机会&quot;}
&gt;    ],
&gt;)
&gt;
&gt;complete_response = response.choices[0].message.content
&gt;print(complete_response)
&gt;```

### 更改情感分析模型

系统集成了多种情感分析方法，可根据需求选择：

#### 1. 多语言情感分析

```bash
cd SentimentAnalysisModel/WeiboMultilingualSentiment
python predict.py --text &quot;This product is amazing!&quot; --lang &quot;en&quot;
```

### 接入自定义业务数据库

#### 1. 修改数据库连接配置

```python
# config.py 中添加您的业务数据库配置
BUSINESS_DB_HOST = &quot;your_business_db_host&quot;
BUSINESS_DB_PORT = 3306
BUSINESS_DB_USER = &quot;your_business_user&quot;
BUSINESS_DB_PASSWORD = &quot;your_business_password&quot;
BUSINESS_DB_NAME = &quot;your_business_database&quot;
```

#### 2. 创建自定义数据访问工具

```python
# InsightEngine/tools/custom_db_tool.py
class CustomBusinessDBTool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;自定义业务数据库查询工具&quot;&quot;&quot;
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_config = {
            &#039;host&#039;: config.BUSINESS_DB_HOST,
            &#039;port&#039;: config.BUSINESS_DB_PORT,
            &#039;user&#039;: config.BUSINESS_DB_USER,
            &#039;password&#039;: config.BUSINESS_DB_PASSWORD,
            &#039;database&#039;: config.BUSINESS_DB_NAME,
        }
    
    def search_business_data(self, query: str, table: str):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;查询业务数据&quot;&quot;&quot;
        # 实现您的业务逻辑
        pass
    
    def get_customer_feedback(self, product_id: str):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;获取客户反馈数据&quot;&quot;&quot;
        # 实现客户反馈查询逻辑
        pass
```

#### 3. 集成到InsightEngine

```python
# InsightEngine/agent.py 中集成自定义工具
from .tools.custom_db_tool import CustomBusinessDBTool

class DeepSearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        # ... 其他初始化代码
        self.custom_db_tool = CustomBusinessDBTool()
    
    def execute_custom_search(self, query: str):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;执行自定义业务数据搜索&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return self.custom_db_tool.search_business_data(query, &quot;your_table&quot;)
```

### 自定义报告模板

#### 1. 在Web界面中上传

系统支持上传自定义模板文件（.md或.txt格式），可在生成报告时选择使用。

#### 2. 创建模板文件

在 `ReportEngine/report_template/` 目录下创建新的模板，我们的Agent会自行选用最合适的模板。

## What is Agents?

&lt;!--BEGIN_DESCRIPTION--&gt;

The Agent Framework is designed for building realtime, programmable participants
that run on servers. Use it to create conversational, multi-modal voice
agents that can see, hear, and understand.

&lt;!--END_DESCRIPTION--&gt;

## Features

- **Flexible integrations**: A comprehensive ecosystem to mix and match the right STT, LLM, TTS, and Realtime API to suit your use case.
- **Integrated job scheduling**: Built-in task scheduling and distribution with [dispatch APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/dispatch/) to connect end users to agents.
- **Extensive WebRTC clients**: Build client applications using LiveKit&#039;s open-source SDK ecosystem, supporting all major platforms.
- **Telephony integration**: Works seamlessly with LiveKit&#039;s [telephony stack](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/), allowing your agent to make calls to or receive calls from phones.
- **Exchange data with clients**: Use [RPCs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/rpc/) and other [Data APIs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/data/) to seamlessly exchange data with clients.
- **Semantic turn detection**: Uses a transformer model to detect when a user is done with their turn, helps to reduce interruptions.
- **MCP support**: Native support for MCP. Integrate tools provided by MCP servers with one loc.
- **Builtin test framework**: Write tests and use judges to ensure your agent is performing as expected.
- **Open-source**: Fully open-source, allowing you to run the entire stack on your own servers, including [LiveKit server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit), one of the most widely used WebRTC media servers.

## Installation

To install the core Agents library, along with plugins for popular model providers:

```bash
pip install &quot;livekit-agents[openai,silero,deepgram,cartesia,turn-detector]~=1.0&quot;
```

## Docs and guides

Documentation on the framework and how to use it can be found [here](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/)

## Core concepts

- Agent: An LLM-based application with defined instructions.
- AgentSession: A container for agents that manages interactions with end users.
- entrypoint: The starting point for an interactive session, similar to a request handler in a web server.
- Worker: The main process that coordinates job scheduling and launches agents for user sessions.

## Usage

### Simple voice agent

---

```python
from livekit.agents import (
    Agent,
    AgentSession,
    JobContext,
    RunContext,
    WorkerOptions,
    cli,
    function_tool,
)
from livekit.plugins import deepgram, elevenlabs, openai, silero

@function_tool
async def lookup_weather(
    context: RunContext,
    location: str,
):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Used to look up weather information.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    return {&quot;weather&quot;: &quot;sunny&quot;, &quot;temperature&quot;: 70}


async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    await ctx.connect()

    agent = Agent(
        instructions=&quot;You are a friendly voice assistant built by LiveKit.&quot;,
        tools=[lookup_weather],
    )
    session = AgentSession(
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
        # any combination of STT, LLM, TTS, or realtime API can be used
        stt=deepgram.STT(model=&quot;nova-3&quot;),
        llm=openai.LLM(model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;),
        tts=elevenlabs.TTS(),
    )

    await session.start(agent=agent, room=ctx.room)
    await session.generate_reply(instructions=&quot;greet the user and ask about their day&quot;)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    cli.run_app(WorkerOptions(entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint))
```

You&#039;ll need the following environment variables for this example:

- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ELEVEN_API_KEY

### Multi-agent handoff

---

This code snippet is abbreviated. For the full example, see [multi_agent.py](examples/voice_agents/multi_agent.py)

```python
...
class IntroAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions=f&quot;You are a story teller. Your goal is to gather a few pieces of information from the user to make the story personalized and engaging.&quot;
            &quot;Ask the user for their name and where they are from&quot;
        )

    async def on_enter(self):
        self.session.generate_reply(instructions=&quot;greet the user and gather information&quot;)

    @function_tool
    async def information_gathered(
        self,
        context: RunContext,
        name: str,
        location: str,
    ):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Called when the user has provided the information needed to make the story personalized and engaging.

        Args:
            name: The name of the user
            location: The location of the user
        &quot;&quot;&quot;

        context.userdata.name = name
        context.userdata.location = location

        story_agent = StoryAgent(name, location)
        return story_agent, &quot;Let&#039;s start the story!&quot;


class StoryAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name: str, location: str) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(
            instructions=f&quot;You are a storyteller. Use the user&#039;s information in order to make the story personalized.&quot;
            f&quot;The user&#039;s name is {name}, from {location}&quot;
            # override the default model, switching to Realtime API from standard LLMs
            llm=openai.realtime.RealtimeModel(voice=&quot;echo&quot;),
            chat_ctx=chat_ctx,
        )

    async def on_enter(self):
        self.session.generate_reply()


async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    await ctx.connect()

    userdata = StoryData()
    session = AgentSession[StoryData](
        vad=silero.VAD.load(),
        stt=deepgram.STT(model=&quot;nova-3&quot;),
        llm=openai.LLM(model=&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;),
        tts=openai.TTS(voice=&quot;echo&quot;),
        userdata=userdata,
    )

    await session.start(
        agent=IntroAgent(),
        room=ctx.room,
    )
...
```

### Testing

Automated tests are essential for building reliable agents, especially with the non-deterministic behavior of LLMs. LiveKit Agents include native test integration to help you create dependable agents.

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_no_availability() -&gt; None:
    llm = google.LLM()
    async AgentSession(llm=llm) as sess:
        await sess.start(MyAgent())
        result = await sess.run(
            user_input=&quot;Hello, I need to place an order.&quot;
        )
        result.expect.skip_next_event_if(type=&quot;message&quot;, role=&quot;assistant&quot;)
        result.expect.next_event().is_function_call(name=&quot;start_order&quot;)
        result.expect.next_event().is_function_call_output()
        await (
            result.expect.next_event()
            .is_message(role=&quot;assistant&quot;)
            .judge(llm, intent=&quot;assistant should be asking the user what they would like&quot;)
        )

```

## Running your agent

### Testing in terminal

```shell
python myagent.py console
```

Runs your agent in terminal mode, enabling local audio input and output for testing.
This mode doesn&#039;t require external servers or dependencies and is useful for quickly validating behavior.

### Developing with LiveKit clients

```shell
python myagent.py dev
```

Starts the agent server and enables hot reloading when files change. This mode allows each process to host multiple concurrent agents efficiently.

The agent connects to LiveKit Cloud or your self-hosted server. Set the following environment variables:
- LIVEKIT_URL
- LIVEKIT_API_KEY
- LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

You can connect using any LiveKit client SDK or telephony integration.
To get started quickly, try the [Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/).

### Running for production

```shell
python myagent.py start
```

Runs the agent with production-ready optimizations.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
- Install the Unitree RL IsaacLab standalone environments.

  - Clone or copy this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_lab.git
    ```
  - Use a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:

    ```bash
    conda activate env_isaaclab
    ./unitree_rl_lab.sh -i
    # restart your shell to activate the environment changes.
    ```
- Download unitree robot description files

  *Method 1: Using USD Files*
  - Download unitree usd files from [unitree_model](https://huggingface.co/datasets/unitreerobotics/unitree_model/tree/main), keeping folder structure
    ```bash
    git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/unitreerobotics/unitree_model
    ```
  - Config `UNITREE_MODEL_DIR` in `source/unitree_rl_lab/unitree_rl_lab/assets/robots/unitree.py`.

    ```bash
    UNITREE_MODEL_DIR = &quot;&lt;/home/user/projects/unitree_usd&gt;&quot;
    ```

  *Method 2: Using URDF Files [Recommended]* Only for Isaacsim &gt;= 5.0
  -  Download unitree robot urdf files from [unitree_ros](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros)
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros.git
      ```
  - Config `UNITREE_ROS_DIR` in `source/unitree_rl_lab/unitree_rl_lab/assets/robots/unitree.py`.
    ```bash
    UNITREE_ROS_DIR = &quot;&lt;/home/user/projects/unitree_ros/unitree_ros&gt;&quot;
    ```
  - [Optional]: change *robot_cfg.spawn* if you want to use urdf files



- Verify that the environments are correctly installed by:

  - Listing the available tasks:

    ```bash
    ./unitree_rl_lab.sh -l # This is a faster version than isaaclab
    ```
  - Running a task:

    ```bash
    ./unitree_rl_lab.sh -t --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity # support for autocomplete task-name
    # same as
    python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --headless --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity
    ```
  - Inference with a trained agent:

    ```bash
    ./unitree_rl_lab.sh -p --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity # support for autocomplete task-name
    # same as
    python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task Unitree-G1-29dof-Velocity
    ```

## Deploy

After the model training is completed, we need to perform sim2sim on the trained strategy in Mujoco to test the performance of the model.
Then deploy sim2real.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev
# Install unitree_sdk2
git clone git@github.com:unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2.git
cd unitree_sdk2
mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF # Install on the /usr/local directory
sudo make install
# Compile the robot_controller
cd unitree_rl_lab/deploy/robots/g1_29dof # or other robots
mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
cmake .. &amp;&amp; make
```

### Sim2Sim

Installing the [unitree_mujoco](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

- Set the `robot` at `/simulate/config.yaml` to g1
- Set `domain_id` to 0
- Set `enable_elastic_hand` to 1
- Set `use_joystck` to 1.

```bash
# start simulation
cd unitree_mujoco/simulate/build
./unitree_mujoco
# ./unitree_mujoco -i 0 -n eth0 -r g1 -s scene_29dof.xml # alternative
```

```bash
cd unitree_rl_lab/deploy/robots/g1_29dof/build
./g1_ctrl
# 1. press [L2 + Up] to set the robot to stand up
# 2. Click the mujoco window, and then press 8 to make the robot feet touch the ground.
# 3. Press [R1 + X] to run the policy.
# 4. Click the mujoco window, and then press 9 to disable the elastic band.
```

### Sim2Real

You can use this program to control the robot directly, but make sure the on-borad control program has been closed.

```bash
./g1_ctrl --network eth0 # eth0 is the network interface name.
```

## Overview

vLLM Ascend (`vllm-ascend`) is a community maintained hardware plugin for running vLLM seamlessly on the Ascend NPU.

It is the recommended approach for supporting the Ascend backend within the vLLM community. It adheres to the principles outlined in the [[RFC]: Hardware pluggable](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/11162), providing a hardware-pluggable interface that decouples the integration of the Ascend NPU with vLLM.

By using vLLM Ascend plugin, popular open-source models, including Transformer-like, Mixture-of-Expert, Embedding, Multi-modal LLMs can run seamlessly on the Ascend NPU.

## Prerequisites

## ⚡ Community Projects

- [DeepWerewolf](https://github.com/af-74413592/DeepWerewolf) — A case study of agent RL training for the Chinese Werewolf game built with AgentScope and Agent Lightning.
- [AgentFlow](https://agentflow.stanford.edu/) — A modular multi-agent framework that combines planner, executor, verifier, and generator agents with the Flow-GRPO algorithm to tackle long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.

## ⚡ Architecture

Agent Lightning keeps the moving parts to a minimum so you can focus on your idea, not the plumbing. Your agent continues to run as usual; you can still use any agent framework you like; you drop in the lightweight `agl.emit_xxx()` helper, or let the tracer collect every prompt, tool call, and reward. Those events become structured spans that flow into the LightningStore, a central hub that keeps tasks, resources, and traces in sync.

On the other side of the store sits the algorithm you choose, or write yourself. The algorithm reads spans, learns from them, and posts updated resources such as refined prompt templates or new policy weights. The Trainer ties it all together: it streams datasets to runners, ferries resources between the store and the algorithm, and updates the inference engine when improvements land. You can either stop there, or simply let the same loop keep turning.

No rewrites, no lock-in, just a clear path from first rollout to steady improvement.

# Changelog
- 2025/10/31 2.6.3 Release
  - Added support for a new backend `vlm-mlx-engine`, enabling MLX-accelerated inference for the MinerU2.5 model on Apple Silicon devices. Compared to the `vlm-transformers` backend, `vlm-mlx-engine` delivers a 100%–200% speed improvement.
  - Bug fixes: #3849, #3859

- 2025/10/24 2.6.2 Release
  - `pipeline` backend optimizations
    - Added experimental support for Chinese formulas, which can be enabled by setting the environment variable `export MINERU_FORMULA_CH_SUPPORT=1`. This feature may cause a slight decrease in MFR speed and failures in recognizing some long formulas. It is recommended to enable it only when parsing Chinese formulas is needed. To disable this feature, set the environment variable to `0`.
    - `OCR` speed significantly improved by 200%~300%, thanks to the optimization solution provided by [@cjsdurj](https://github.com/cjsdurj)
    - `OCR` models optimized for improved accuracy and coverage of Latin script recognition, and updated Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, Telugu (te), and Tamil (ta) language systems to `ppocr-v5` version, with accuracy improved by over 40% compared to previous models 
  - `vlm` backend optimizations
    - `table_caption` and `table_footnote` matching logic optimized to improve the accuracy of table caption and footnote matching and reading order rationality in scenarios with multiple consecutive tables on a page
    - Optimized CPU resource usage during high concurrency when using `vllm` backend, reducing server pressure
    - Adapted to `vllm` version 0.11.0
  - General optimizations
    - Cross-page table merging effect optimized, added support for cross-page continuation table merging, improving table merging effectiveness in multi-column merge scenarios
    - Added environment variable configuration option `MINERU_TABLE_MERGE_ENABLE` for table merging feature. Table merging is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting this variable to `0`

- 2025/09/26 2.5.4 released
  - 🎉🎉 The MinerU2.5 [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22186) is now available! We welcome you to read it for a comprehensive overview of its model architecture, training strategy, data engineering and evaluation results.
  - Fixed an issue where some `PDF` files were mistakenly identified as `AI` files, causing parsing failures

- 2025/09/20 2.5.3 Released
  - Dependency version range adjustment to enable Turing and earlier architecture GPUs to use vLLM acceleration for MinerU2.5 model inference.
  - `pipeline` backend compatibility fixes for torch 2.8.0.
  - Reduced default concurrency for vLLM async backend to lower server pressure and avoid connection closure issues caused by high load.
  - More compatibility-related details can be found in the [announcement](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU/discussions/3548)

- 2025/09/19 2.5.2 Released

  We are officially releasing MinerU2.5, currently the most powerful multimodal large model for document parsing.
  With only 1.2B parameters, MinerU2.5&#039;s accuracy on the OmniDocBench benchmark comprehensively surpasses top-tier multimodal models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B. It also significantly outperforms leading specialized models such as dots.ocr, MonkeyOCR, and PP-StructureV3.
  The model has been released on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/opendatalab/MinerU2.5-2509-1.2B) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/opendatalab/MinerU2.5-2509-1.2B) platforms. Welcome to download and use!
  - Core Highlights:
    - SOTA Performance with Extreme Efficiency: As a 1.2B model, it achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results that exceed models in the 10B and 100B+ classes, redefining the performance-per-parameter standard in document AI.
    - Advanced Architecture for Across-the-Board Leadership: By combining a two-stage inference pipeline (decoupling layout analysis from content recognition) with a native high-resolution architecture, it achieves SOTA performance across five key areas: layout analysis, text recognition, formula recognition, table recognition, and reading order.
  - Key Capability Enhancements:
    - Layout Detection: Delivers more complete results by accurately covering non-body content like headers, footers, and page numbers. It also provides more precise element localization and natural format reconstruction for lists and references.
    - Table Parsing: Drastically improves parsing for challenging cases, including rotated tables, borderless/semi-structured tables, and long/complex tables.
    - Formula Recognition: Significantly boosts accuracy for complex, long-form, and hybrid Chinese-English formulas, greatly enhancing the parsing capability for mathematical documents.

  Additionally, with the release of vlm 2.5, we have made some adjustments to the repository:
  - The vlm backend has been upgraded to version 2.5, supporting the MinerU2.5 model and no longer compatible with the MinerU2.0-2505-0.9B model. The last version supporting the 2.0 model is mineru-2.2.2.
  - VLM inference-related code has been moved to [mineru_vl_utils](https://github.com/opendatalab/mineru-vl-utils), reducing coupling with the main mineru repository and facilitating independent iteration in the future.
  - The vlm accelerated inference framework has been switched from `sglang` to `vllm`, achieving full compatibility with the vllm ecosystem, allowing users to use the MinerU2.5 model and accelerated inference on any platform that supports the vllm framework.
  - Due to major upgrades in the vlm model supporting more layout types, we have made some adjustments to the structure of the parsing intermediate file `middle.json` and result file `content_list.json`. Please refer to the [documentation](https://opendatalab.github.io/MinerU/reference/output_files/) for details.

  Other repository optimizations:
  - Removed file extension whitelist validation for input files. When input files are PDF documents or images, there are no longer requirements for file extensions, improving usability.

      &lt;li&gt;
        Major Updates
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;In this version, we focused on improving table parsing accuracy by introducing a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RapidAI/TableStructureRec&quot;&gt;wired table recognition model&lt;/a&gt; and a brand-new hybrid table structure parsing algorithm, significantly enhancing the table recognition capabilities of the &lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt; backend.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;We also added support for cross-page table merging, which is supported by both &lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vlm&lt;/code&gt; backends, further improving the completeness and accuracy of table parsing.&lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt; added OCR capability support for Thai and Greek, and updated the English OCR model to the latest version. English recognition accuracy improved by 11%, Thai recognition model accuracy is 82.68%, and Greek recognition model accuracy is 89.28% (by PPOCRv5)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;bbox&lt;/code&gt; field (mapped to 0-1000 range) in the output &lt;code&gt;content_list.json&lt;/code&gt;, making it convenient for users to directly obtain position information for each content block&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Removed the &lt;code&gt;pipeline_old_linux&lt;/code&gt; installation option, no longer supporting legacy Linux systems such as &lt;code&gt;CentOS 7&lt;/code&gt;, to provide better support for &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;&#039;s &lt;code&gt;sync&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; commands&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

&gt; **_ATTENTION_**: The EIPs repository has recently [undergone](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7206) a separation of ERCs and EIPs. ERCs are now accessible at [https://github.com/ethereum/ercs](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs). All new ERCs and updates to existing ones must be directed at this new repository. The editors apologize for this inconvenience.

The goal of the EIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for Ethereum itself and conventions built upon it. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to Ethereum in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) governs how EIPs are published.

The [status page](https://eips.ethereum.org/) tracks and lists EIPs, which can be divided into the following categories:

- [Core EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/core) are improvements to the Ethereum consensus protocol.
- [Networking EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/networking) specify the peer-to-peer networking layer of Ethereum.
- [Interface EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/interface) standardize interfaces to Ethereum, which determine how users and applications interact with the blockchain.
- [ERCs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) specify application layer standards, which determine how applications running on Ethereum can interact with each other.
- [Meta EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta) are miscellaneous improvements that nonetheless require some sort of consensus.
- [Informational EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational) are non-standard improvements that do not require any form of consensus.

**Before you write an EIP, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) or [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8). Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), which describes the EIP process.**

Please note that this repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing them. These types of inquiries should be directed to the [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com). For specific questions and concerns regarding EIPs, it&#039;s best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the EIP denoted by the `discussions-to` tag in the EIP&#039;s preamble.

If you would like to become an EIP Editor, please read [EIP-5069](./EIPS/eip-5069.md).

## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for an EIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at &lt;https://eips.ethereum.org/&gt;. For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is &lt;https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1&gt;.

Consider any document not published at &lt;https://eips.ethereum.org/&gt; as a working paper. Additionally, consider published EIPs with a status of &quot;draft&quot;, &quot;review&quot;, or &quot;last call&quot; to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.

## Validation and Automerging

## 🎯 The Problem Every AI Developer Faces

You build an AI agent. It works great in testing. Then real users start talking to it and...

- ❌ It ignores your carefully crafted system prompts
- ❌ It hallucinates responses in critical moments
- ❌ It can&#039;t handle edge cases consistently
- ❌ Each conversation feels like a roll of the dice

**Sound familiar?** You&#039;re not alone. This is the #1 pain point for developers building production AI agents.

## ⚡ The Solution: Stop Fighting Prompts, Teach Principles

Parlant flips the script on AI agent development. Instead of hoping your LLM will follow instructions, **Parlant ensures it**.

```python
# Traditional approach: Cross your fingers 🤞
system_prompt = &quot;You are a helpful assistant. Please follow these 47 rules...&quot;

# Parlant approach: Ensured compliance ✅
await agent.create_guideline(
    condition=&quot;Customer asks about refunds&quot;,
    action=&quot;Check order status first to see if eligible&quot;,
    tools=[check_order_status],
)
```

#### Parlant gives you all the structure you need to build customer-facing agents that behave exactly as your business requires:

- **[Journeys](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/journeys)**:
  Define clear customer journeys and how your agent should respond at each step.

- **[Behavioral Guidelines](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/guidelines)**:
  Easily craft agent behavior; Parlant will match the relevant elements contextually.

- **[Tool Use](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/tools)**:
  Attach external APIs, data fetchers, or backend services to specific interaction events.

- **[Domain Adaptation](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/glossary)**:
  Teach your agent domain-specific terminology and craft personalized responses.

- **[Canned Responses](https://parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/canned-responses)**:
  Use response templates to eliminate hallucinations and guarantee style consistency.

- **[Explainability](https://parlant.io/docs/advanced/explainability)**:
  Understand why and when each guideline was matched and followed.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

## 🚀 Get Your Agent Running in 60 Seconds

&lt;/div&gt;

```bash
pip install parlant
```

```python
import parlant.sdk as p

@p.tool
async def get_weather(context: p.ToolContext, city: str) -&gt; p.ToolResult:
    # Your weather API logic here
    return p.ToolResult(f&quot;Sunny, 72°F in {city}&quot;)

@p.tool
async def get_datetime(context: p.ToolContext) -&gt; p.ToolResult:
    from datetime import datetime
    return p.ToolResult(datetime.now())

async def main():
    async with p.Server() as server:
        agent = await server.create_agent(
            name=&quot;WeatherBot&quot;,
            description=&quot;Helpful weather assistant&quot;
        )

        # Have the agent&#039;s context be updated on every response (though
        # update interval is customizable) using a context variable.
        await agent.create_variable(name=&quot;current-datetime&quot;, tool=get_datetime)

        # Control and guide agent behavior with natural language
        await agent.create_guideline(
            condition=&quot;User asks about weather&quot;,
            action=&quot;Get current weather and provide a friendly response with suggestions&quot;,
            tools=[get_weather]
        )

        # Add other (reliably enforced) behavioral modeling elements
        # ...

        # 🎉 Test playground ready at http://localhost:8800
        # Integrate the official React widget into your app,
        # or follow the tutorial to build your own frontend!

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**That&#039;s it!** Your agent is running with ensured rule-following behavior.

MONAI is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based, [open-source](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/dev/LICENSE) framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging, part of the [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).
Its ambitions are as follows:

- Developing a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating on a common foundation;
- Creating state-of-the-art, end-to-end training workflows for healthcare imaging;
- Providing researchers with the optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate deep learning models.

## Features

&gt; _Please see [the technical highlights](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/highlights.html) and [What&#039;s New](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html) of the milestone releases._

- flexible pre-processing for multi-dimensional medical imaging data;
- compositional &amp; portable APIs for ease of integration in existing workflows;
- domain-specific implementations for networks, losses, evaluation metrics and more;
- customizable design for varying user expertise;
- multi-GPU multi-node data parallelism support.

## Requirements

MONAI works with the [currently supported versions of Python](https://devguide.python.org/versions), and depends directly on NumPy and PyTorch with many optional dependencies.

* Major releases of MONAI will have dependency versions stated for them. The current state of the `dev` branch in this repository is the unreleased development version of MONAI which typically will support current versions of dependencies and include updates and bug fixes to do so.
* PyTorch support covers [the current version](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases) plus three previous minor versions. If compatibility issues with a PyTorch version and other dependencies arise, support for a version may be delayed until a major release.
* Our support policy for other dependencies adheres for the most part to [SPEC0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000), where dependency versions are supported where possible for up to two years. Discovered vulnerabilities or defects may require certain versions to be explicitly not supported.
* See the `requirements*.txt` files for dependency version information.

## Installation

To install [the current release](https://pypi.org/project/monai/), you can simply run:

```bash
pip install monai
```
