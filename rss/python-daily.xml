            <h2>README</h2><pre># What is the Live Agent Studio?

The [Live Agent Studio](https://studio.ottomator.ai) is a community-driven platform developed by [oTTomator](https://ottomator.ai) for you to explore cutting-edge AI agents and learn how to implement them for yourself or your business! All agents on this platform are open source and, over time, will cover a very large variety of use cases.

The goal with the studio is to build an educational platform for you to learn how to do incredible things with AI, while still providing practical value so that you’ll want to use the agents just for the sake of what they can do for you!

This platform is still in beta – expect longer response times under load, a rapidly growing agent library over the coming months, and a lot more content on this platform soon on Cole Medin’s YouTube channel!

# What is this Repository for?

This repository contains the source code/workflow JSON for all the agents on the Live Agent Studio! Every agent being added to the platform is currently be open sourced here so we can not only create a curated collection of cutting-edge agents together as a community, but also learn from one another!

## Tokens

Most agents on the Live Agent Studio cost tokens to use, which are purchasable on the platform. However, when you first sign in you are given some tokens to start so you can use the agents free of charge! The biggest reason agents cost tokens is that we pay for the LLM usage since we host all the agents developed by you and the rest of the community!

[Purchase Tokens](https://studio.ottomator.ai/pricing)

## Future Plans

As the Live Agent Studio develops, it will become the go-to place to stay on top of what is possible with AI agents! Anytime there is a new AI technology, groundbreaking agent research, or a new tool/library to build agents with, it’ll be featured through agents on the platform. It’s a tall order, but we have big plans for the oTTomator community, and we’re confident we can grow to accomplish this!

## FAQ

### I want to build an agent to showcase in the Live Agent Studio! How do I do that?

Head on over here to learn how to build an agent for the platform:

[Developer Guide](https://studio.ottomator.ai/guide)

Also check out [the sample n8n agent](~sample-n8n-agent~) for a starting point of building an n8n agent for the Live Agent Studio, and [the sample Python agent](~sample-python-agent~) for Python.

### How many tokens does it cost to use an agent?

Each agent will charge tokens per prompt. The number of tokens depends on the agent, as some agents use larger LLMs, some call LLMs multiple times, and some use paid APIs.

### Where can I go to talk about all these agents and get help implementing them myself?

Head on over to our Think Tank community and feel free to make a post!

## Overview [(Try STORM now!)](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/)

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/overview.svg&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
STORM is a LLM system that writes Wikipedia-like articles from scratch based on Internet search. Co-STORM further enhanced its feature by enabling human to collaborative LLM system to support more aligned and preferred information seeking and knowledge curation.

While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.

**More than 70,000 people have tried our [live research preview](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/). Try it out to see how STORM can help your knowledge exploration journey and please provide feedback to help us improve the system 🙏!**



## How STORM &amp; Co-STORM works

### STORM

STORM breaks down generating long articles with citations into two steps:

1. **Pre-writing stage**: The system conducts Internet-based research to collect references and generates an outline.
2. **Writing stage**: The system uses the outline and references to generate the full-length article with citations.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/two_stages.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 60%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

STORM identifies the core of automating the research process as automatically coming up with good questions to ask. Directly prompting the language model to ask questions does not work well. To improve the depth and breadth of the questions, STORM adopts two strategies:
1. **Perspective-Guided Question Asking**: Given the input topic, STORM discovers different perspectives by surveying existing articles from similar topics and uses them to control the question-asking process.
2. **Simulated Conversation**: STORM simulates a conversation between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert grounded in Internet sources to enable the language model to update its understanding of the topic and ask follow-up questions.

### CO-STORM

Co-STORM proposes **a collaborative discourse protocol** which implements a turn management policy to support smooth collaboration among 

- **Co-STORM LLM experts**: This type of agent generates answers grounded on external knowledge sources and/or raises follow-up questions based on the discourse history.
- **Moderator**: This agent generates thought-provoking questions inspired by information discovered by the retriever but not directly used in previous turns. Question generation can also be grounded!
- **Human user**: The human user will take the initiative to either (1) observe the discourse to gain deeper understanding of the topic, or (2) actively engage in the conversation by injecting utterances to steer the discussion focus.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;assets/co-storm-workflow.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 60%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Co-STORM also maintains a dynamic updated **mind map**, which organize collected information into a hierarchical concept structure, aiming to **build a shared conceptual space between the human user and the system**. The mind map has been proven to help reduce the mental load when the discourse goes long and in-depth. 

Both STORM and Co-STORM are implemented in a highly modular way using [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy).

## Installation


To install the knowledge storm library, use `pip install knowledge-storm`. 

You could also install the source code which allows you to modify the behavior of STORM engine directly.
1. Clone the git repository.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm.git
    cd storm
    ```
   
2. Install the required packages.
   ```shell
   conda create -n storm python=3.11
   conda activate storm
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   

## API

Currently, our package support:

- Language model components: All language models supported by litellm as listed [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)
- Embedding model components: All embedding models supported by litellm as listed [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/embedding/supported_embedding)
- retrieval module components: `YouRM`, `BingSearch`, `VectorRM`, `SerperRM`, `BraveRM`, `SearXNG`, `DuckDuckGoSearchRM`, `TavilySearchRM`, `GoogleSearch`, and `AzureAISearch` as 

:star2: **PRs for integrating more search engines/retrievers into [knowledge_storm/rm.py](knowledge_storm/rm.py) are highly appreciated!**

Both STORM and Co-STORM are working in the information curation layer, you need to set up the information retrieval module and language model module to create their `Runner` classes respectively.

### STORM

The STORM knowledge curation engine is defined as a simple Python `STORMWikiRunner` class. Here is an example of using You.com search engine and OpenAI models.

```python
import os
from knowledge_storm import STORMWikiRunnerArguments, STORMWikiRunner, STORMWikiLMConfigs
from knowledge_storm.lm import LitellmModel
from knowledge_storm.rm import YouRM

lm_configs = STORMWikiLMConfigs()
openai_kwargs = {
    &#039;api_key&#039;: os.getenv(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;),
    &#039;temperature&#039;: 1.0,
    &#039;top_p&#039;: 0.9,
}
# STORM is a LM system so different components can be powered by different models to reach a good balance between cost and quality.
# For a good practice, choose a cheaper/faster model for `conv_simulator_lm` which is used to split queries, synthesize answers in the conversation.
# Choose a more powerful model for `article_gen_lm` to generate verifiable text with citations.
gpt_35 = LitellmModel(model=&#039;gpt-3.5-turbo&#039;, max_tokens=500, **openai_kwargs)
gpt_4 = LitellmModel(model=&#039;gpt-4o&#039;, max_tokens=3000, **openai_kwargs)
lm_configs.set_conv_simulator_lm(gpt_35)
lm_configs.set_question_asker_lm(gpt_35)
lm_configs.set_outline_gen_lm(gpt_4)
lm_configs.set_article_gen_lm(gpt_4)
lm_configs.set_article_polish_lm(gpt_4)
# Check out the STORMWikiRunnerArguments class for more configurations.
engine_args = STORMWikiRunnerArguments(...)
rm = YouRM(ydc_api_key=os.getenv(&#039;YDC_API_KEY&#039;), k=engine_args.search_top_k)
runner = STORMWikiRunner(engine_args, lm_configs, rm)
```

The `STORMWikiRunner` instance can be evoked with the simple `run` method:
```python
topic = input(&#039;Topic: &#039;)
runner.run(
    topic=topic,
    do_research=True,
    do_generate_outline=True,
    do_generate_article=True,
    do_polish_article=True,
)
runner.post_run()
runner.summary()
```
- `do_research`: if True, simulate conversations with difference perspectives to collect information about the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `do_generate_outline`: if True, generate an outline for the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `do_generate_article`: if True, generate an article for the topic based on the outline and the collected information; otherwise, load the results.
- `do_polish_article`: if True, polish the article by adding a summarization section and (optionally) removing duplicate content; otherwise, load the results.

### Co-STORM

The Co-STORM knowledge curation engine is defined as a simple Python `CoStormRunner` class. Here is an example of using Bing search engine and OpenAI models.

```python
from knowledge_storm.collaborative_storm.engine import CollaborativeStormLMConfigs, RunnerArgument, CoStormRunner
from knowledge_storm.lm import LitellmModel
from knowledge_storm.logging_wrapper import LoggingWrapper
from knowledge_storm.rm import BingSearch

# Co-STORM adopts the same multi LM system paradigm as STORM 
lm_config: CollaborativeStormLMConfigs = CollaborativeStormLMConfigs()
openai_kwargs = {
    &quot;api_key&quot;: os.getenv(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;),
    &quot;api_provider&quot;: &quot;openai&quot;,
    &quot;temperature&quot;: 1.0,
    &quot;top_p&quot;: 0.9,
    &quot;api_base&quot;: None,
} 
question_answering_lm = LitellmModel(model=gpt_4o_model_name, max_tokens=1000, **openai_kwargs)
discourse_manage_lm = LitellmModel(model=gpt_4o_model_name, max_tokens=500, **openai_kwargs)
utterance_polishing_lm = LitellmModel(model=gpt_4o_model_name, max_tokens=2000, **openai_kwargs)
warmstart_outline_gen_lm = LitellmModel(model=gpt_4o_model_name, max_tokens=500, **openai_kwargs)
question_asking_lm = LitellmModel(model=gpt_4o_model_name, max_tokens=300, **openai_kwargs)
knowledge_base_lm = LitellmModel(model=gpt_4o_model_name, max_tokens=1000, **openai_kwargs)

lm_config.set_question_answering_lm(question_answering_lm)
lm_config.set_discourse_manage_lm(discourse_manage_lm)
lm_config.set_utterance_polishing_lm(utterance_polishing_lm)
lm_config.set_warmstart_outline_gen_lm(warmstart_outline_gen_lm)
lm_config.set_question_asking_lm(question_asking_lm)
lm_config.set_knowledge_base_lm(knowledge_base_lm)

# Check out the Co-STORM&#039;s RunnerArguments class for more configurations.
topic = input(&#039;Topic: &#039;)
runner_argument = RunnerArgument(topic=topic, ...)
logging_wrapper = LoggingWrapper(lm_config)
bing_rm = BingSearch(bing_search_api_key=os.environ.get(&quot;BING_SEARCH_API_KEY&quot;),
                     k=runner_argument.retrieve_top_k)
costorm_runner = CoStormRunner(lm_config=lm_config,
                               runner_argument=runner_argument,
                               logging_wrapper=logging_wrapper,
                               rm=bing_rm)
```

The `CoStormRunner` instance can be evoked with the `warmstart()` and `step(...)` methods.

```python
# Warm start the system to build shared conceptual space between Co-STORM and users
costorm_runner.warm_start()

# Step through the collaborative discourse 
# Run either of the code snippets below in any order, as many times as you&#039;d like
# To observe the conversation:
conv_turn = costorm_runner.step()
# To inject your utterance to actively steer the conversation:
costorm_runner.step(user_utterance=&quot;YOUR UTTERANCE HERE&quot;)

# Generate report based on the collaborative discourse
costorm_runner.knowledge_base.reorganize()
article = costorm_runner.generate_report()
print(article)
```



## Quick Start with Example Scripts

We provide scripts in our [examples folder](examples) as a quick start to run STORM and Co-STORM with different configurations.

We suggest using `secrets.toml` to set up the API keys. Create a file `secrets.toml` under the root directory and add the following content:

```shell
# ============ language model configurations ============ 
# Set up OpenAI API key.
OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your_openai_api_key&quot;
# If you are using the API service provided by OpenAI, include the following line:
OPENAI_API_TYPE=&quot;openai&quot;
# If you are using the API service provided by Microsoft Azure, include the following lines:
OPENAI_API_TYPE=&quot;azure&quot;
AZURE_API_BASE=&quot;your_azure_api_base_url&quot;
AZURE_API_VERSION=&quot;your_azure_api_version&quot;
# ============ retriever configurations ============ 
BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=&quot;your_bing_search_api_key&quot; # if using bing search
# ============ encoder configurations ============ 
ENCODER_API_TYPE=&quot;openai&quot; # if using openai encoder
```

### STORM examples

**To run STORM with `gpt` family models with default configurations:**

Run the following command.
```bash
python examples/storm_examples/run_storm_wiki_gpt.py \
    --output-dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
    --retriever bing \
    --do-research \
    --do-generate-outline \
    --do-generate-article \
    --do-polish-article
```

**To run STORM using your favorite language models or grounding on your own corpus:** Check out [examples/storm_examples/README.md](examples/storm_examples/README.md).

### Co-STORM examples

To run Co-STORM with `gpt` family models with default configurations,

1. Add `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=&quot;xxx&quot;` and `ENCODER_API_TYPE=&quot;xxx&quot;` to `secrets.toml`
2. Run the following command

```bash
python examples/costorm_examples/run_costorm_gpt.py \
    --output-dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
    --retriever bing
```


## Customization of the Pipeline

### STORM

If you have installed the source code, you can customize STORM based on your own use case. STORM engine consists of 4 modules:

1. Knowledge Curation Module: Collects a broad coverage of information about the given topic.
2. Outline Generation Module: Organizes the collected information by generating a hierarchical outline for the curated knowledge.
3. Article Generation Module: Populates the generated outline with the collected information.
4. Article Polishing Module: Refines and enhances the written article for better presentation.

The interface for each module is defined in `knowledge_storm/interface.py`, while their implementations are instantiated in `knowledge_storm/storm_wiki/modules/*`. These modules can be customized according to your specific requirements (e.g., generating sections in bullet point format instead of full paragraphs).

### Co-STORM

If you have installed the source code, you can customize Co-STORM based on your own use case

1. Co-STORM introduces multiple LLM agent types (i.e. Co-STORM experts and Moderator). LLM agent interface is defined in `knowledge_storm/interface.py` , while its implementation is instantiated in `knowledge_storm/collaborative_storm/modules/co_storm_agents.py`. Different LLM agent policies can be customized.
2. Co-STORM introduces a collaborative discourse protocol, with its core function centered on turn policy management. We provide an example implementation of turn policy management through `DiscourseManager` in `knowledge_storm/collaborative_storm/engine.py`. It can be customized and further improved.

## Datasets
To facilitate the study of automatic knowledge curation and complex information seeking, our project releases the following datasets:

### FreshWiki
The FreshWiki Dataset is a collection of 100 high-quality Wikipedia articles focusing on the most-edited pages from February 2022 to September 2023. See Section 2.1 in [STORM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) for more details.

You can download the dataset from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EchoShao8899/FreshWiki) directly. To ease the data contamination issue, we archive the [source code](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm/tree/NAACL-2024-code-backup/FreshWiki) for the data construction pipeline that can be repeated at future dates.

### WildSeek
To study users’ interests in complex information seeking tasks in the wild, we utilized data collected from the web research preview to create the WildSeek dataset. We downsampled the data to ensure the diversity of the topics and the quality of the data. Each data point is a pair comprising a topic and the user’s goal for conducting deep search on the topic.  For more details, please refer to Section 2.2 and Appendix A of [Co-STORM paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.15232).

The WildSeek dataset is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuchengJiang/WildSeek).

            <h2>README</h2><pre># LMCache core library

## Installation

**Prerequisite:** Python &gt;= 3.10

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Demos
Feel free to try our docker-based demos yourself! All the demos are available [in this repo](https://github.com/LMCache/demo).

## Quickstart: 

**Prerequisites**: To run the quickstart demo, your server should have 1 GPU and the [docker environment](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

**Step 1:** Pull docker images
```bash
docker pull apostacyh/vllm:lmcache-0.1.0
```

**Step 2:** Start vLLM + LMCache 
```bash
model=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2    # Replace with your model name
sudo docker run --runtime nvidia --gpus &#039;&quot;device=0&quot;&#039; \
    -v &lt;Huggingface cache dir on your local machine&gt;:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --env &quot;HF_TOKEN=&lt;Your huggingface access token&gt;&quot; \
    --ipc=host \
    --network=host \
    apostacyh/vllm:lmcache-0.1.0 \
    --model $model --gpu-memory-utilization 0.6 --port 8000 \
    --lmcache-config-file /lmcache/LMCache/examples/example-local.yaml
```
Please fill `Huggingface cache dir on your local machine` and `Your huggingface access token` in the above command. 

You can also change the `model` variable to use different models.

The vLLM engine is ready after you see the logs like this:
```
INFO:     Started server process [865615]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Step 3:** Run demo application

You can now run the demo application in the LMCache repo. Please execute the following commands on the server
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache
cd LMCache/examples/

# Install openai client library
pip install openai

# Start the demo chat application
python openai_chat_completion_client.py 8000
```

This demo is a QA application based on a long context (`examples/f.txt`). The TTFT should be drastically reduced since the second round of QA.



## Use case 1: share prefix KV between different vLLM instance through LMCache
The following instructions help deploy LMCache backend + multile vLLM instance by docker containers. The architecture of the demo application looks like this:

&lt;img width=&quot;817&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache/assets/25103655/ab64f84d-26e1-46ce-a503-e7e917b618bc&quot;&gt;


**Prerequisites**: To run the quickstart demo, your server must have 2 GPUs and the [docker environment](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.


**Step 1:** Pull docker images
```bash
docker pull apostacyh/lmcache-server:0.1.0
docker pull apostacyh/vllm:lmcache-0.1.0
```

**Step 2:** Start LMCache backend server 
```bash
docker run --name lmcache-server --network host -d apostacyh/lmcache-server:0.1.0 0.0.0.0 65432
```

**Step 3:** start 2 vLLM instances
```bash
# The first vLLM instance listens at port 8000
model=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2    # Replace with your model name
sudo docker run --runtime nvidia --gpus &#039;&quot;device=0&quot;&#039; \
    -v &lt;Huggingface cache dir on your local machine&gt;:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --env &quot;HF_TOKEN=&lt;Your huggingface token&gt;&quot; \
    --ipc=host \
    --network=host \
    apostacyh/vllm:lmcache-0.1.0 \
    --model $model --gpu-memory-utilization 0.7 --port 8000 \
    --lmcache-config-file /lmcache/LMCache/examples/example.yaml
```

Now, open another terminal and start another vLLM instance
```bash
# The second vLLM instance listens at port 8001
model=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2    # Replace with your model name
sudo docker run --runtime nvidia --gpus &#039;&quot;device=1&quot;&#039; \
    -v &lt;Huggingface cache dir on your local machine&gt;:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -p 8001:8001 \
    --env &quot;HF_TOKEN=&lt;Your huggingface token&gt;&quot; \
    --ipc=host \
    --network=host \
    apostacyh/vllm:lmcache-0.1.0 \
    --model $model --gpu-memory-utilization 0.7 --port 8001 \
    --lmcache-config-file /lmcache/LMCache/examples/example.yaml
```

Remember to replace the `Huggingface cache dir on your local machine` and `Your huggingface token` in the commandline.

The vLLM engines are ready after you see the logs like this:
```
INFO:     Started server process [865615]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Step 4:** Run demo application
You can run the demo application in the LMCache repo. Please execute the following commands on the server
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache
cd LMCache/examples/

# Install openai client library
pip install openai
```

In one terminal:
```
# Connect to the first vLLM engine
python openai_chat_completion_client.py 8000
```

In another terminal
```
# Connect to the second vLLM engine
python openai_chat_completion_client.py 8001
```

You should be able to see the second vLLM engine has much lower response delay.
This is because the KV cache of the long context can be shared across both vLLM engines by using LMCache.

Pixeltable is the only Python framework that provides incremental storage, transformation, indexing, and orchestration of your multimodal data.

## 😩 Maintaining Production-Ready Multimodal AI Apps is Still Too Hard

Building robust AI applications, especially [multimodal](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/bringing-data) ones, requires stitching together numerous tools:
*   ETL pipelines for data loading and transformation.
*   Vector databases for semantic search.
*   Feature stores for ML models.
*   Orchestrators for scheduling.
*   Model serving infrastructure for inference.
*   Separate systems for parallelization, caching, versioning, and lineage tracking.

This complex &quot;data plumbing&quot; slows down development, increases costs, and makes applications brittle and hard to reproduce.

## 💾 Installation

```python
pip install pixeltable
```

**Pixeltable is a database.** It stores metadata and computed results persistently, typically in a `.pixeltable` directory in your workspace. See [configuration](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/overview/configuration) options for your setup.

## ✨ What is Pixeltable?

With Pixeltable, you define your *entire* data processing and AI workflow declaratively using **[computed columns](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/computed-columns)** on **[tables](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/tables-and-operations)**. Pixeltable&#039;s engine then automatically handles:

*   **Data Ingestion &amp; Storage:** References [files](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/bringing-data) (images, videos, audio, docs) in place, handles structured data.
*   **Transformation &amp; Processing:** Applies *any* Python function ([UDFs](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/custom-functions)) or built-in operations ([chunking, frame extraction](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/iterators)) automatically.
*   **AI Model Integration:** Runs inference ([embeddings](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/embedding-index), [object detection](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/examples/vision/yolox), [LLMs](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/integrations/frameworks#cloud-llm-providers)) as part of the data pipeline.
*   **Indexing &amp; Retrieval:** Creates and manages vector indexes for fast [semantic search](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/embedding-index#phase-3%3A-query) alongside traditional filtering.
*   **Incremental Computation:** Only [recomputes](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/overview/quick-start) what&#039;s necessary when data or code changes, saving time and cost.
*   **Versioning &amp; Lineage:** Automatically tracks data and schema changes for reproducibility.

**Focus on your application logic, not the infrastructure.**


## 🚀 Key Features

* **[Unified Multimodal Interface:](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/tables-and-operations)** `pxt.Image`, `pxt.Video`, `pxt.Audio`, `pxt.Document`, etc. – manage diverse data consistently.
  ```python
  t = pxt.create_table(
    &#039;media&#039;, 
    {
        &#039;img&#039;: pxt.Image, 
        &#039;video&#039;: pxt.Video
    }
  )
  ```

* **[Declarative Computed Columns:](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/computed-columns)** Define processing steps once; they run automatically on new/updated data.
  ```python
  t.add_computed_column(
    classification=huggingface.vit_for_image_classification(
        t.image
    )
  )
  ```

* **[Built-in Vector Search:](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/embedding-index)** Add embedding indexes and perform similarity searches directly on tables/views.
  ```python
  t.add_embedding_index(
    &#039;img&#039;, 
    embedding=clip.using(
        model_id=&#039;openai/clip-vit-base-patch32&#039;
    )
  )

  sim = t.img.similarity(&quot;cat playing with yarn&quot;)
  ```

* **[On-the-Fly Data Views:](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/datastore/views)** Create virtual tables using iterators for efficient processing without data duplication.
  ```python
  frames = pxt.create_view(
    &#039;frames&#039;, 
    videos, 
    iterator=FrameIterator.create(
        video=videos.video, 
        fps=1
    )

## 💡 Key Examples

*(See the [Full Quick Start](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/overview/quick-start) or [Notebook Gallery](#-notebook-gallery) for more details)*

**1. Multimodal Data Store and Data Transformation (Computed Column):**
```bash
pip install pixeltable
```

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Create a table
t = pxt.create_table(
    &#039;films&#039;, 
    {&#039;name&#039;: pxt.String, &#039;revenue&#039;: pxt.Float, &#039;budget&#039;: pxt.Float}, 
    if_exists=&quot;replace&quot;
)

t.insert([
  {&#039;name&#039;: &#039;Inside Out&#039;, &#039;revenue&#039;: 800.5, &#039;budget&#039;: 200.0},
  {&#039;name&#039;: &#039;Toy Story&#039;, &#039;revenue&#039;: 1073.4, &#039;budget&#039;: 200.0}
])

# Add a computed column for profit - runs automatically!
t.add_computed_column(profit=(t.revenue - t.budget), if_exists=&quot;replace&quot;)

# Query the results
print(t.select(t.name, t.profit).collect())
# Output includes the automatically computed &#039;profit&#039; column
```

**2. Object Detection with [YOLOX](https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable-yolox):**

```bash
pip install pixeltable pixeltable-yolox
```

```python
import PIL
import pixeltable as pxt
from yolox.models import Yolox
from yolox.data.datasets import COCO_CLASSES

t = pxt.create_table(&#039;image&#039;, {&#039;image&#039;: pxt.Image}, if_exists=&#039;replace&#039;)

# Insert some images
prefix = &#039;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons&#039;
paths = [
    &#039;/1/15/Cat_August_2010-4.jpg&#039;,
    &#039;/e/e1/Example_of_a_Dog.jpg&#039;,
    &#039;/thumb/b/bf/Bird_Diversity_2013.png/300px-Bird_Diversity_2013.png&#039;
]
t.insert({&#039;image&#039;: prefix + p} for p in paths)

@pxt.udf
def detect(image: PIL.Image.Image) -&gt; list[str]:
    model = Yolox.from_pretrained(&quot;yolox_s&quot;)
    result = model([image])
    coco_labels = [COCO_CLASSES[label] for label in result[0][&quot;labels&quot;]]
    return coco_labels

t.add_computed_column(classification=detect(t.image))

print(t.select().collect())
```

**3. Image Similarity Search (CLIP Embedding Index):**

```bash
pip install pixeltable sentence-transformers
```

```python
import pixeltable as pxt
from pixeltable.functions.huggingface import clip

# Create image table and add sample images
images = pxt.create_table(&#039;my_images&#039;, {&#039;img&#039;: pxt.Image}, if_exists=&#039;replace&#039;)
images.insert([
    {&#039;img&#039;: &#039;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Orange_tabby_cat_sitting_on_fallen_leaves-Hisashi-01A.jpg/1920px-Orange_tabby_cat_sitting_on_fallen_leaves-Hisashi-01A.jpg&#039;},
    {&#039;img&#039;: &#039;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Retriever_in_water.jpg&#039;}
])

# Add CLIP embedding index for similarity search
images.add_embedding_index(
    &#039;img&#039;,
    embedding=clip.using(model_id=&#039;openai/clip-vit-base-patch32&#039;)
)

# Text-based image search
query_text = &quot;a dog playing fetch&quot;
sim_text = images.img.similarity(query_text)
results_text = images.order_by(sim_text, asc=False).limit(3).select(
    image=images.img, similarity=sim_text
).collect()
print(&quot;--- Text Query Results ---&quot;)
print(results_text)

# Image-based image search
query_image_url = &#039;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Huskiesatrest.jpg/2880px-Huskiesatrest.jpg&#039;
sim_image = images.img.similarity(query_image_url)
results_image = images.order_by(sim_image, asc=False).limit(3).select(
    image=images.img, similarity=sim_image
).collect()
print(&quot;--- Image URL Query Results ---&quot;)
print(results_image)
```

**4. Multimodal/Incremental RAG Workflow (Document Chunking &amp; LLM Call):**

```bash
pip install pixeltable openai spacy sentence-transformers
```

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

```python
import pixeltable as pxt
import pixeltable.functions as pxtf
from pixeltable.functions import openai, huggingface
from pixeltable.iterators import DocumentSplitter

# Manage your tables by directories
directory = &quot;my_docs&quot;
pxt.drop_dir(directory, if_not_exists=&quot;ignore&quot;, force=True)
pxt.create_dir(&quot;my_docs&quot;)

# Create a document table and add a PDF

docs.insert([{&#039;doc&#039;: &#039;https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/raw/release/docs/resources/rag-demo/Jefferson-Amazon.pdf&#039;}])

# Create chunks view with sentence-based splitting
chunks = pxt.create_view(
    &#039;doc_chunks&#039;,
    docs,
    iterator=DocumentSplitter.create(document=docs.doc, separators=&#039;sentence&#039;)
)

# Explicitly create the embedding function object
embed_model = huggingface.sentence_transformer.using(model_id=&#039;all-MiniLM-L6-v2&#039;)
# Add embedding index using the function object
chunks.add_embedding_index(&#039;text&#039;, string_embed=embed_model)

# Define query function for retrieval - Returns a DataFrame expression
@pxt.query
def get_relevant_context(query_text: str, limit: int = 3):
    sim = chunks.text.similarity(query_text)
    # Return a list of strings (text of relevant chunks)
    return chunks.order_by(sim, asc=False).limit(limit).select(chunks.text)

# Build a simple Q&amp;A table
qa = pxt.create_table(f&#039;{directory}.qa_system&#039;, {&#039;prompt&#039;: pxt.String})

# 1. Add retrieved context (now a list of strings)
qa.add_computed_column(context=get_relevant_context(qa.prompt))

            <h2>README</h2><pre># RL Swarm

RL Swarm is a peer-to-peer system for reinforcement learning. It allows you to train models collaboratively with others in the swarm, leveraging their collective intelligence. It is open source and permissionless, meaning you can run it on a consumer laptop at home or on a powerful GPU in the cloud. You can also connect your model to the Gensyn Testnet to receive an on-chain identity that tracks your progress over time.

Currently, we are running the [reasoning-gym](https://github.com/open-thought/reasoning-gym/tree/main) swarm on the Testnet. This swarm is designed to train models to solve a diverse set of reasoning tasks using the reasoning-gym dataset. The current list of default models includes:

Models:
   - Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
   - Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
   - nvidia/AceInstruct-1.5B
   - dnotitia/Smoothie-Qwen3-1.7B
   - Gensyn/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct

This iteration of rl-swarm is powered by the [GenRL-Swarm](https://github.com/gensyn-ai/genrl-swarm) library.  It is a fully composable framework for decentralized reinforcement learning which enables users to create and customize their own swarms for reinforcement learning with multi-agent multi-stage environments.

## Requirements

Your hardware requirements will vary depending on a number of factors including model size and the accelerator platform you use.  Users running large NVIDIA GPU will be assigned a model from the large model pool, while users running less powerful hardware will be assigned a model from the small model pool. This design decision is intended to allow users to advance at a similar rate regardless of the hardware they use, maximizing their utility to the swarm.      

**Supported Hardware**

- arm64 or x86 CPU with minimum 32gb ram (note that if you run other applications during training it might crash training).


OR

- CUDA devices (officially supported):
    - RTX 3090
    - RTX 4090
    - RTX 5090
    - A100
    - H100


With either configuration, you will need Python &gt;=3.10 (for Mac, you will likely need to upgrade).

## ⚠️ Please read before continuing ⚠️

This software is **experimental** and provided as-is for users who are interested in using (or helping to develop) an early version of the Gensyn Protocol for training models.

If you care about on-chain participation, you **must** read the [Identity Management](#identity-management) section below.

If you encounter issues, please first check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). If you cannot find a solution there, please check if there is an open (or closed) [Issue](../../issues). If there is no relevant issue, please file one and include 1) all relevant [logs](#troubleshooting), 2) information about your device (e.g. which GPU, if relevant), and 3) your operating system information.

## Instructions

### Run the Swarm

The easiest way to run RL Swarm is using Docker. This ensures a consistent setup across all operating systems with minimal dependencies.

#### 1. Clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm
```

#### 2. Install Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed and the Docker daemon is running on your machine. To do that, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) according to your OS. Ensure you allot sufficient memory to the Docker containers. For example if using Docker Desktop, this can be done by going to Docker Desktop Settings &gt; Resources &gt; Advanced &gt; Memory Limit, and increasing it to the maximum possible value.

#### 3. Start the Swarm

Run the following commands from the root of the repository.

##### CPU support

 If you’re using a Mac or if your machine has CPU-only support:
```sh
docker-compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-cpu
```

##### GPU support

If you&#039;re using a machine with an officially supported GPU:
```sh
docker-compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-gpu
```

##### Docker compose issue

If `docker-compose` does not work when running the above commands, please try `docker compose` (no hyphen) instead. I.e. ` docker compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-gpu`. This issue sometimes occurs on users running Ubuntu.

### Experimental (advanced) mode

If you want to experiment with the [GenRL-Swarm](https://github.com/gensyn-ai/genrl-swarm) library and its [configurable parameters](https://github.com/gensyn-ai/genrl-swarm/blob/main/recipes/rgym/rg-swarm.yaml), we recommend you run RL Swarm via shell script:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```  
To learn more about experimental mode, check out our [getting started guide](https://github.com/gensyn-ai/genrl-swarm/blob/main/getting_started.ipynb).

### Login

1. A browser window will pop open (you&#039;ll need to manually navigate to http://localhost:3000/ if you&#039;re on a VM).
2. Click &#039;login&#039;.
3. Login with your preferred method.

### Huggingface

If you would like to upload your model to Hugging Face, enter your Hugging Face access token when prompted. You can generate one from your Hugging Face account, under [Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

### Initial peering and training

From this stage onward your device will begin training. You should see your peer register and vote on-chain [here](https://gensyn-testnet.explorer.alchemy.com/address/0xFaD7C5e93f28257429569B854151A1B8DCD404c2?tab=logs).

You can also track your training progress in real time:
- On The RL-Swarm Dashboard: [dashboard.gensyn.ai](https://dashboard.gensyn.ai)

## Identity management

### Introduction

On-chain identity is managed via an Alchemy modal sign-in screen. You need to supply an email address or login via a supported method (e.g. Google). This creates an EOA public/private key (which are stored by Alchemy). You will also receive local session keys in the `userApiKey`. Note that these aren&#039;t your EOA public/private keys. 

During the initial set-up process, you will also create a `swarm.pem` file which maintains the identity of your peer. This is then registered on chain using the EOA wallet hosted in Alchemy, triggered using your local api keys. This links the `swarm.pem` to the `email address` (and corresponding EOA in Alchemy).

**If you want to link multiple nodes to a single EOA**, simply sign up each node using the same email address. You will get a new peer ID for each node, however they will all be linked to the same EOA that your email is linked to.

**Please note**: if you are using a fork of this repo, or a service organised by someone else (e.g. a &#039;one click deployment&#039; provider) the identity management flow below is not guaranteed.

### What this means
In the following two scenarios, everything will work (i.e. you will have an on-chain identity linked with your RL Swarm peer training):

- The very first time you run the node from scratch with a new email address. The smart account will be created fresh and linked with the swarm.pem that is also fresh.
- If you run it again with a `swarm.pem` AND login the original `email address` used with that `swarm.pem`. Note: this will throw an error into the log on registration but will still be able to sign transactions.

In the following two scenarios, it will not work (i.e. you won&#039;t have an on-chain identity linked with your RL Swarm peer training):

- If you keep your `swarm.pem` and try to link it to an `email address` distinct from the one with which it was first registered.

Therefore, you should do these actions in the following scenarios

- **Signed up with `email address`, generated `swarm.pem`, BUT lost `swarm.pem`** OR **You want to run multiple nodes at once**: run from scratch with the same email address and generate a new `swarm.pem`. 
- **Signed up with `email address`, generated `swarm.pem`, kept `swarm.pem`** -&gt; you can re-run a single node using this pair if you&#039;ve still got them both.

## Troubleshooting

- **How do I find my logs?** You can find them inside the `/logs` directory:
    - `yarn.log`: This file contains logs for the modal login server.
    - `swarm.log`: This is the main log file for the RL Swarm application.
    - `wandb/`: This directory contains various logs related to your training runs, including a `debug.log` file. These can be updated to Weights &amp; Biases (only available if you log_with wandb).

- **My peer &#039;skipped a round&#039;**: this occurs when your device isn&#039;t fast enough to keep up with the pace of the swarm. For example, if you start training at round 100 and by the time you finish training the rest of the swarm reaches round 102, you will skip round 101 and go straight to 102. This is because your peer is more valuable if it is participating in the active round.
- **My model doesn&#039;t seem to be training?**

    - If you&#039;re using a consumer device (e.g. a MacBook), it is likely just running slowly - check back in 20 minutes.

- **Logging in with a new account after previous login?**
    
    - Make sure you click &#039;Logout&#039; on the login screen before you leave your previous session
    - Make sure you delete `swarm.pem` from the root directory (try `sudo rm swarm.pem`). If you don&#039;t do this, and you previously registered with the peer-id stored in this file, it will disrupt the training process.

- **Issues with the Login screen**

    - **Upgrade viem**: some users report issues with the `viem` package. There are two fixes:
        - in the `modal-login/package.json` update: `&quot;viem&quot;: &quot;2.25.0&quot;`
        - in the terminal `cd /root/rl-swarm/modal-login/ &amp;&amp; yarn upgrade &amp;&amp; yarn add next@latest &amp;&amp; yarn add viem@latest`

- **I&#039;m getting lots of warnings**
    - This is expected behaviour and usually the output of the package managers or other dependencies. The most common is the below Protobuf warning - which can be ignored
        ```
        WARNING: The candidate selected for download or install is a yanked version: &#039;protobuf&#039; candidate...
        ```

- **Issues on VMs/VPSs?**

    - **How do I access the login screen if I&#039;m running in a VM?**: port forwarding. Add this SSH flag: `-L 3000:localhost:3000` when connecting to your VM. E.g. `gcloud compute ssh --zone &quot;us-central1-a&quot; [your-vm] --project [your-project] -- -L 3000:localhost:3000`. Note, some VPSs may not work with `rl-swarm`. Check the Gensyn [discord](https://discord.gg/AdnyWNzXh5) for up-to-date information on this.
    
    - **Disconnection/general issues**: If you are tunneling to a VM and suffer a broken pipe, you will likely encounter OOM or unexpected behaviour the first time you relaunch the script. If you `control + c` and kill the script it should spin down all background processes. Restart the script and everything should work normally.

- **Issues with npm/general installation?**

    - Try  `npm install -g node@latest`

- **OOM errors on MacBook?**
    - Try this (experimental) fix to increase memory:
        ```
        export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0
        ```
- **I have a Windows machine, can I still train a model on the swarm?**: Yes - but this is not very well tested and may require you to do some debugging to get it set up properly. Install WSL and Linux on your Windows machine using the following instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

- **I want to move my to a different machine and/or restart with a fresh build of the repo, but I want my animal name/peer id to persist.**: To achieve this simply backup the `swarm.pem` file on your current machine and then put it in the corresponding location on your new machine/build of the repo.

- **I have multiple GPUs on one machine, can I run multiple peers?**: Yes - but you&#039;ll need to manually change things. You&#039;ll need to isolate each GPU, install this repo for each GPU, and expose each peer under a different port to pass the modal onboard.

- **My round/stage is behind the smart contract/other peers?**: This is expected behaviour given the different speeds of machines in the network. Once your machine completes it&#039;s current round, it will move to the the current round.

- **I want to use a bigger and/or different model in the RL swarm, can I do that?**: Yes - but we only recommend doing so if you are comfortable understanding what size model can reasonably run on your hardware.  If you elect to bring a custom model, just paste the repo/model name into the command line when prompted.

- **I am running a model in the swarm on my CPU, have received a python `RuntimeError`, and my training progress seems to have stopped.**: There are several possible causes for this, but before trying anything please wait long enough to be sure your training actually is frozen and not just slow (e.g., wait longer than a single training iteration has previously taken on your machine). If you&#039;re sure training is actually frozen, then some things to try are:
    - Set this (experimental) fix: `export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0 &amp;&amp; ./run_rl_swarm.sh`

            <h2>README</h2><pre># mihomo
A simple python pydantic model (type hint and autocompletion support) for Honkai: Star Rail parsed data from the Mihomo API.

API url: https://api.mihomo.me/sr_info_parsed/{UID}?lang={LANG}

## Installation
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/KT-Yeh/mihomo.git
```

## Usage

### Basic
There are two parsed data formats:
- V1:
  - URL: https://api.mihomo.me/sr_info_parsed/800333171?lang=en&amp;version=v1
  - Fetching: use `client.fetch_user_v1(800333171)`
  - Data model: `mihomo.models.v1.StarrailInfoParsedV1`
  - All models defined in `mihomo/models/v1` directory.
- V2: 
  - URL: https://api.mihomo.me/sr_info_parsed/800333171?lang=en
  - Fetching: use `client.fetch_user(800333171)`
  - Data model: `mihomo.models.StarrailInfoParsed`
  - All models defined in `mihomo/models` directory.

If you don&#039;t want to use `client.get_icon_url` to get the image url everytime, you can use `client.fetch_user(800333171, replace_icon_name_with_url=True)` to get the parsed data with asset urls.

### Example
```py
import asyncio

from mihomo import Language, MihomoAPI
from mihomo.models import StarrailInfoParsed
from mihomo.models.v1 import StarrailInfoParsedV1

client = MihomoAPI(language=Language.EN)


async def v1():
    data: StarrailInfoParsedV1 = await client.fetch_user_v1(800333171)

    print(f&quot;Name: {data.player.name}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Level: {data.player.level}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Signature: {data.player.signature}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Achievements: {data.player_details.achievements}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Characters count: {data.player_details.characters}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Profile picture url: {client.get_icon_url(data.player.icon)}&quot;)
    for character in data.characters:
        print(&quot;-----------&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Name: {character.name}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Rarity: {character.rarity}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Level: {character.level}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Avatar url: {client.get_icon_url(character.icon)}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Preview url: {client.get_icon_url(character.preview)}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Portrait url: {client.get_icon_url(character.portrait)}&quot;)


async def v2():
    data: StarrailInfoParsed = await client.fetch_user(800333171, replace_icon_name_with_url=True)

    print(f&quot;Name: {data.player.name}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Level: {data.player.level}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Signature: {data.player.signature}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Profile picture url: {data.player.avatar.icon}&quot;)
    for character in data.characters:
        print(&quot;-----------&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Name: {character.name}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Rarity: {character.rarity}&quot;)
        print(f&quot;Portrait url: {character.portrait}&quot;)

asyncio.run(v1())
asyncio.run(v2())
```

### Tools
`from mihomo import tools`
#### Remove Duplicate Character
```py
    data = await client.fetch_user(800333171)
    data = tools.remove_duplicate_character(data)
```

#### Merge Character Data
```py
    old_data = await client.fetch_user(800333171)

    # Change characters in game and wait for the API to refresh
    # ...

    new_data = await client.fetch_user(800333171)
    data = tools.merge_character_data(new_data, old_data)
```

### Data Persistence
Take pickle and json as an example
```py
import pickle
import zlib
from mihomo import MihomoAPI, Language, StarrailInfoParsed

client = MihomoAPI(language=Language.EN)
data = await client.fetch_user(800333171)

# Save
pickle_data = zlib.compress(pickle.dumps(data))
print(len(pickle_data))
json_data = data.json(by_alias=True, ensure_ascii=False)
print(len(json_data))

# Load
data_from_pickle = pickle.loads(zlib.decompress(pickle_data))
data_from_json = StarrailInfoParsed.parse_raw(json_data)
print(type(data_from_pickle))
print(type(data_from_json))
```

## API usage

Our API offers access to all models including our Pro tier non-open weight models. Check out our API documentation [docs.bfl.ai](https://docs.bfl.ai/) to learn more.

## Licensing models for commercial use

You can license our models for commercial use here: https://bfl.ai/pricing/licensing

As the fee is based on a monthly usage, we provide code to automatically track your usage via the BFL API. To enable usage tracking please select *track_usage* in the cli or click the corresponding checkmark in our provided demos.

### Example: Using FLUX.1 Kontext with usage tracking

We provide a reference implementation for running FLUX.1 with usage tracking enabled for commercial licensing.
This can be customized as needed as long as the usage reporting is accurate.

For the reporting logic to work you will need to set your API key as an environment variable before running:
```bash
export BFL_API_KEY=&quot;your_api_key_here&quot;
```

You can call `FLUX.1 Kontext [dev]` like this with tracking activated:

```bash
python -m flux kontext --track_usage --loop
```

For a single generation:

```bash
python -m flux kontext --track_usage --prompt &quot;replace the logo with the text &#039;Black Forest Labs&#039;&quot;
```

The above reporting logic works similarly for FLUX.1 [dev] and FLUX.1 Tools [dev].

**Note that this is only required when using one or more of our open weights models commercially. More information on the commercial licensing can be found at the [BFL Helpdesk](https://help.bfl.ai/collections/6939000511-licensing).**

Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it&#039;s possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it&#039;s not plug-and-play.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Neo4j MCP Clients &amp; Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. 

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any other MCP Client (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), to use natural language to accomplish things with Neo4j and your Aura account, e.g.:

* What is in this graph?
* Render a chart from the top products sold by frequency, total and average volume
* List my instances
* Create a new instance named mcp-test for Aura Professional with 4GB and Graph Data Science enabled
* Store the fact that I worked on the Neo4j MCP Servers today with Andreas and Oskar

## Servers

## UPDATE
You can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)

If you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program

For other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer to their documentation

&lt;a id=&quot;update-channels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.

* `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.
* The `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project&#039;s new patches and changes. This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip&#039;s `--pre` flag).
* The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).

When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.

You may also use `--update-to &lt;repository&gt;` (`&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.

Example usage:

* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release
* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`
* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel
* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`

**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:
```
# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly

# To install nightly with pip:
python3 -m pip install -U --pre &quot;yt-dlp[default]&quot;
```

## DEPENDENCIES
Python versions 3.9+ (CPython) and 3.10+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.

&lt;!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created
&lt;!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x&gt;
On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt;

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are highly recommended

### Strongly recommended

* [**ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**](https://www.ffmpeg.org) - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds

    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)

To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms.

The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with **\*** included.

If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the `--verbose` output


## COMPILE

### Standalone PyInstaller Builds
To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and `pyinstaller` (plus any of yt-dlp&#039;s [optional dependencies](#dependencies) if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used.

You can run the following commands:

```
python3 devscripts/install_deps.py --include pyinstaller
python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python3 -m bundle.pyinstaller
```

On some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`.

`python -m bundle.pyinstaller` accepts any arguments that can be passed to `pyinstaller`, such as `--onefile/-F` or `--onedir/-D`, which is further [documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate).

**Note**: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 [do not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.

**Important**: Running `pyinstaller` directly **instead of** using `python -m bundle.pyinstaller` is **not** officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.

### Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)
You will need the build tools `python` (3.9+), `zip`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`\* and `pytest`\*.

After installing these, simply run `make`.

You can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with **\*** are not needed for this)

### Related scripts

* **`devscripts/install_deps.py`** - Install dependencies for yt-dlp.
* **`devscripts/update-version.py`** - Update the version number based on the current date.
* **`devscripts/set-variant.py`** - Set the build variant of the executable.
* **`devscripts/make_changelog.py`** - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update `CONTRIBUTORS` file.
* **`devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`** - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable `YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS` to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading.

Note: See their `--help` for more info.

            <h2>README</h2><pre># Home Assistant Operating System

Home Assistant Operating System (formerly HassOS) is a Linux based operating system optimized to host [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) and its [Add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/).

Home Assistant Operating System uses Docker as its container engine. By default it deploys the Home Assistant Supervisor as a container. Home Assistant Supervisor in turn uses the Docker container engine to control Home Assistant Core and Add-Ons in separate containers. Home Assistant Operating System is **not** based on a regular Linux distribution like Ubuntu. It is built using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) and it is optimized to run Home Assistant. It targets single board compute (SBC) devices like the Raspberry Pi or ODROID but also supports x86-64 systems with UEFI.

[![Home Assistant - A project from the Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/badges/home-assistant.png)](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/)

## Features

- Lightweight and memory-efficient
- Minimized I/O
- Over The Air (OTA) updates
- Offline updates
- Modular using Docker container engine

## Supported hardware

- Nabu Casa
- Raspberry Pi
- Hardkernel ODROID
- Asus Tinker Board
- Generic x86-64 (e.g. Intel NUC)
- Virtual appliances

See the full list and specific models [here](./Documentation/boards/README.md)

## Getting Started

If you just want to use Home Assistant the official [getting started guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) and [installation instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/) take you through how to download Home Assistant Operating System and get it running on your machine.

If you&#039;re interested in finding out more about Home Assistant Operating System and how it works read on...

## Development

If you don&#039;t have experience with embedded systems, Buildroot or the build process for Linux distributions it is recommended to read up on these topics first (e.g. [Bootlin](https://bootlin.com/docs/) has excellent resources).

The Home Assistant Operating System documentation can be found on the [Home Assistant Developer Docs website](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/operating-system).

### Components

- **Bootloader:**
  - [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) for devices that support UEFI
  - [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) for devices that don&#039;t support UEFI
- **Operating System:**
  - [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) LTS Linux
- **File Systems:**
  - [SquashFS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/squashfs.txt) for read-only file systems (using LZ4 compression)
  - [ZRAM](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt) for `/tmp`, `/var` and swap (using LZ4 compression)
- **Container Platform:**
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) for running Home Assistant components in containers
- **Updates:**
  - [RAUC](https://rauc.io/) for Over The Air (OTA) and USB updates
- **Security:**
  - [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) Linux kernel security module

### Development builds

The Development build GitHub Action Workflow is a manually triggered workflow
which creates Home Assistant OS development builds. The development builds are
available at [https://os-artifacts.home-assistant.io/index.html](https://os-artifacts.home-assistant.io/index.html).

### Unable to install?

The present program needs an AI model(`wybxc/DocLayout-YOLO-DocStructBench-onnx`) before working and some users are not able to download due to network issues. If you have a problem with downloading this model, we provide a workaround using the following environment variable:

```shell
set HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
```

For PowerShell user:

```shell
$env:HF_ENDPOINT = https://hf-mirror.com
```

If the solution does not work to you / you encountered other issues, please refer to [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate/wiki#-faq--%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98).

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Advanced Options&lt;/h2&gt;

Execute the translation command in the command line to generate the translated document `example-mono.pdf` and the bilingual document `example-dual.pdf` in the current working directory. Use Google as the default translation service. More support translation services can find [HERE](https://github.com/Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate/blob/main/docs/ADVANCED.md#services).
