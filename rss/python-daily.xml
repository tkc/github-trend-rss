# Framework of Qlib

&lt;div style=&quot;align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/img/framework-abstract.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The high-level framework of Qlib can be found above(users can find the [detailed framework](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/introduction.html#framework) of Qlib&#039;s design when getting into nitty gritty).
The components are designed as loose-coupled modules, and each component could be used stand-alone.

Qlib provides a strong infrastructure to support Quant research. [Data](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html) is always an important part.
A strong learning framework is designed to support diverse learning paradigms (e.g. [reinforcement learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/rl.html), [supervised learning](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html#model-section)) and patterns at different levels(e.g. [market dynamic modeling](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/meta.html)).
By modeling the market, [trading strategies](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/strategy.html) will generate trade decisions that will be executed. Multiple trading strategies and executors in different levels or granularities can be [nested to be optimized and run together](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/highfreq.html).
At last, a comprehensive [analysis](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/report.html) will be provided and the model can be [served online](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/online.html) in a low cost.


# Quick Start

This quick start guide tries to demonstrate
1. It&#039;s very easy to build a complete Quant research workflow and try your ideas with _Qlib_.
2. Though with *public data* and *simple models*, machine learning technologies **work very well** in practical Quant investment.

Here is a quick **[demo](https://terminalizer.com/view/3f24561a4470)** shows how to install ``Qlib``, and run LightGBM with ``qrun``. **But**, please make sure you have already prepared the data following the [instruction](#data-preparation).


## Installation

This table demonstrates the supported Python version of `Qlib`:
|               | install with pip      | install from source  |        plot        |
| ------------- |:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| Python 3.8    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.9    | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.10   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.11   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python 3.12   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: |

**Note**: 
1. **Conda** is suggested for managing your Python environment. In some cases, using Python outside of a `conda` environment may result in missing header files, causing the installation failure of certain packages.
2. Please pay attention that installing cython in Python 3.6 will raise some error when installing ``Qlib`` from source. If users use Python 3.6 on their machines, it is recommended to *upgrade* Python to version 3.8 or higher, or use `conda`&#039;s Python to install ``Qlib`` from source.

### Install with pip
Users can easily install ``Qlib`` by pip according to the following command.

```bash
  pip install pyqlib
```

**Note**: pip will install the latest stable qlib. However, the main branch of qlib is in active development. If you want to test the latest scripts or functions in the main branch. Please install qlib with the methods below.

### Install from source
Also, users can install the latest dev version ``Qlib`` by the source code according to the following steps:

* Before installing ``Qlib`` from source, users need to install some dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install --upgrade cython
  ```

* Clone the repository and install ``Qlib`` as follows.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git &amp;&amp; cd qlib
    pip install .  # `pip install -e .[dev]` is recommended for development. check details in docs/developer/code_standard_and_dev_guide.rst
    ```

**Tips**: If you fail to install `Qlib` or run the examples in your environment,  comparing your steps and the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test_qlib_from_source.yml) may help you find the problem.

**Tips for Mac**: If you are using Mac with M1, you might encounter issues in building the wheel for LightGBM, which is due to missing dependencies from OpenMP. To solve the problem, install openmp first with ``brew install libomp`` and then run ``pip install .`` to build it successfully. 

## Data Preparation
‚ùó Due to more restrict data security policy. The offical dataset is disabled temporarily. You can try [this data source](https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases) contributed by the community.
Here is an example to download the latest data.
```bash
wget https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases/latest/download/qlib_bin.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data
tar -zxvf qlib_bin.tar.gz -C ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --strip-components=1
rm -f qlib_bin.tar.gz
```

The official dataset below will resume in short future.


----

Load and prepare data by running the following code:

### Get with module
  ```bash
  # get 1d data
  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn

  # get 1min data
  python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min

  ```

### Get from source

  ```bash
  # get 1d data
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn

  # get 1min data
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min

  ```

This dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](scripts/data_collector/), which have been released in
the same repository.
Users could create the same dataset with it. [Description of dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector#description-of-dataset)

*Please pay **ATTENTION** that the data is collected from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup), and the data might not be perfect.
We recommend users to prepare their own data if they have a high-quality dataset. For more information, users can refer to the [related document](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/data.html#converting-csv-format-into-qlib-format)*.

### Automatic update of daily frequency data (from yahoo finance)
  &gt; This step is *Optional* if users only want to try their models and strategies on history data.
  &gt; 
  &gt; It is recommended that users update the data manually once (--trading_date 2021-05-25) and then set it to update automatically.
  &gt;
  &gt; **NOTE**: Users can&#039;t incrementally  update data based on the offline data provided by Qlib(some fields are removed to reduce the data size). Users should use [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance) to download Yahoo data from scratch and then incrementally update it.
  &gt; 
  &gt; For more information, please refer to: [yahoo collector](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/main/scripts/data_collector/yahoo#automatic-update-of-daily-frequency-datafrom-yahoo-finance)

  * Automatic update of data to the &quot;qlib&quot; directory each trading day(Linux)
      * use *crontab*: `crontab -e`
      * set up timed tasks:

        ```
        * * * * 1-5 python &lt;script path&gt; update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir &lt;user data dir&gt;
        ```
        * **script path**: *scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py*

  * Manual update of data
      ```
      python scripts/data_collector/yahoo/collector.py update_data_to_bin --qlib_data_1d_dir &lt;user data dir&gt; --trading_date &lt;start date&gt; --end_date &lt;end date&gt;
      ```
      * *trading_date*: start of trading day

### Checking the health of the data
  * We provide a script to check the health of the data, you can run the following commands to check whether the data is healthy or not.
    ```
    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data
    ```
  * Of course, you can also add some parameters to adjust the test results, such as this.
    ```
    python scripts/check_data_health.py check_data --qlib_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --missing_data_num 30055 --large_step_threshold_volume 94

Welcome to OpenHands (formerly OpenDevin), a platform for software development agents powered by AI.

OpenHands agents can do anything a human developer can: modify code, run commands, browse the web,
call APIs, and yes‚Äîeven copy code snippets from StackOverflow.

Learn more at [docs.all-hands.dev](https://docs.all-hands.dev), or [sign up for OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev) to get started.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; Using OpenHands for work? We&#039;d love to chat! Fill out
&gt; [this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)
&gt; to join our Design Partner program, where you&#039;ll get early access to commercial features and the opportunity to provide input on our product roadmap.

![App screenshot](./docs/static/img/screenshot.png)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è OpenHands Cloud
The easiest way to get started with OpenHands is on [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev),
which comes with $50 in free credits for new users.

## üíª Running OpenHands Locally

OpenHands can also run on your local system using Docker.
See the [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation) guide for
system requirements and more information.

&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; On a public network? See our [Hardened Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation)
&gt; to secure your deployment by restricting network binding and implementing additional security measures.


```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.39
```

You&#039;ll find OpenHands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

When you open the application, you&#039;ll be asked to choose an LLM provider and add an API key.
[Anthropic&#039;s Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
works best, but you have [many options](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/llms).

## üí° Other ways to run OpenHands

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; OpenHands is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation.
&gt; It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in authentication, isolation, or scalability.
&gt;
&gt; If you&#039;re interested in running OpenHands in a multi-tenant environment, please
&gt; [get in touch with us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)
&gt; for advanced deployment options.

You can also [connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem),
run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),
interact with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode),
or run it on tagged issues with [a github action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/github-action).

Visit [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation) for more information and setup instructions.

----------------------------------------


MindsDB enables humans, AI, agents, and applications to get highly accurate answers across sprawled and large scale data sources.

&lt;img width=&quot;1454&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87930824-2624-4c71-ac08-475e12e5475f&quot; /&gt;

[MindsDB has an MCP server built in](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mcp/overview) that enables your MCP applications to connect, unify and respond to questions over large-scale federated data‚Äîspanning databases, data warehouses, and SaaS applications.

## Minds [Demo](https://mdb.ai/register)
Play with [Minds demo](https://mdb.ai/register), and see the power of MindsDB at answering questions from structured to unstructured data, whether it&#039;s scattered across SaaS applications, databases, or... hibernating in data warehouses like that $100 bill in your tuxedo pocket from prom night, lost, waiting to be discovered.
 
## Install MindsDB Server 

MindsDB is an open-source server that can be deployed anywhere - from your laptop to the cloud, and everywhere in between. And yes, you can customize it to your heart&#039;s content.

  * [Using Docker Desktop](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop). This is the fastest and recommended way to get started and have it all running.
  * [Using Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker). This is also simple, but gives you more flexibility on how to further customize your server.
  * [Using PyPI](https://docs.mindsdb.com/contribute/install). This option enables you to contribute to MindsDB.

----------------------------------------

# Core Philosophy: Connect, Unify, Respond

MindsDB&#039;s architecture is built around three fundamental capabilities:

## [Connect](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview) Your Data

You can connect to hundreds of enterprise [data sources (learn more)](https://docs.mindsdb.com/integrations/data-overview). These integrations allow MindsDB to access data wherever it resides, forming the foundation for all other capabilities.

## [Unify](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/overview) Your Data

Once connected, these data sources can be queried using a full SQL dialect, as if they were all part of a single database. MindsDB‚Äôs federated query engine translates your SQL queries and executes them on the appropriate connected data sources.

When working with many data sources, it‚Äôs important to prepare and unify your data before generating responses from it. MindsDB SQL offers virtual tables (views, knowledge bases, ml-models) to allow working with heterogeneous data as if it were unified in a single organized system.

* [**VIEWS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/view) ‚Äì Simplify data access by creating unified views across different sources (no-ETL).
* [**KNOWLEDGE BASES**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases) ‚Äì Index and organize unstructured data for efficient retrieval.
* [**ML MODELS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/model) ‚Äì Apply AI/ML transformations to gain insights from your data.

Unification of data can be automated using JOBs

* [**JOBS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/jobs) ‚Äì Schedule synchronization and transformation tasks for real-time processing.


## [Respond](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) From Your Data

Chat with Your Data

* [**AGENTS**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/agents/agent) ‚Äì Configure built-in agents specialized in answering questions over your connected and unified data.
* [**MCP**](https://docs.mindsdb.com/mcp/overview) ‚Äì Connect to MindsDB through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless interaction.

## Study guide

&gt; Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).

![Imgur](images/OfVllex.png)

**Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?**

**A: No, you don&#039;t need to know everything here to prepare for the interview**.

What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

* How much experience you have
* What your technical background is
* What positions you are interviewing for
* Which companies you are interviewing with
* Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.

Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.
* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.
* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.

## How to approach a system design interview question

&gt; How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions

Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

### Step 2: Create a high level design

Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations

You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)
* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)
* [Latency numbers every programmer should know](#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)

First, you&#039;ll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](https://web.archive.org/web/20221030091841/http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](https://web.archive.org/web/20220530193911/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602114024/https://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126233752/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](https://web.archive.org/web/20220926171507/https://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we&#039;ll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we&#039;ll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.

## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

## Setup for running LLM locally on your machine

**Hardware Requirements:**

To run LLMs locally, you&#039;ll need sufficient hardware. At a minimum, a GPU capable of running Qwen/Deepseek 14B is required. See the FAQ for detailed model/performance recommendations.

**Setup your local provider**  

Start your local provider, for example with ollama:

```sh
ollama serve
```

See below for a list of local supported provider.

**Update the config.ini**

Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to a supported provider and provider_model to a LLM supported by your provider. We recommand reasoning model such as *Qwen* or *Deepseek*.

See the **FAQ** at the end of the README for required hardware.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = True # Whenever you are running locally or with remote provider.
provider_name = ollama # or lm-studio, openai, etc..
provider_model = deepseek-r1:14b # choose a model that fit your hardware
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
agent_name = Jarvis # name of your AI
recover_last_session = True # whenever to recover the previous session
save_session = True # whenever to remember the current session
speak = True # text to speech
listen = False # Speech to text, only for CLI
work_dir =  /Users/mlg/Documents/workspace # The workspace for AgenticSeek.
jarvis_personality = False # Whenever to use a more &quot;Jarvis&quot; like personality (experimental)
languages = en zh # The list of languages, Text to speech will default to the first language on the list
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = True # Whenever to use headless browser, recommanded only if you use web interface.
stealth_mode = True # Use undetected selenium to reduce browser detection
```

Warning: Do *NOT* set provider_name to `openai` if using LM-studio for running LLMs. Set it to `lm-studio`.

Note: Some provider (eg: lm-studio) require you to have `http://` in front of the IP. For example `http://127.0.0.1:1234`

**List of local providers**

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (set `provider_name` to `lm-studio`)|
| openai    | Yes     |  Use openai compatible API (eg: llama.cpp server)  |

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Run with an API** section if your hardware can&#039;t run deepseek locally*

*See the **Config** section for detailled config file explanation.*

---

## Setup to run with an API

Set the desired provider in the `config.ini`. See below for a list of API providers.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = google
provider_model = gemini-2.0-flash
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000 # doesn&#039;t matter
```
Warning: Make sure there is not trailing space in the config.

Export your API key: `export &lt;&lt;PROVIDER&gt;&gt;_API_KEY=&quot;xxx&quot;`

Example: export `TOGETHER_API_KEY=&quot;xxxxx&quot;`

**List of API providers**
  
| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| openai    | Depends  | Use ChatGPT API  |
| deepseek  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                            |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |
| togetherAI | No    | Use together AI API (non-private)                         |
| google | No    | Use google gemini API (non-private)                         |

*We advice against using gpt-4o or other closedAI models*, performance are poor for web browsing and task planning.

Please also note that coding/bash might fail with gemini, it seem to ignore our prompt for format to respect, which are optimized for deepseek r1.

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Config** section for detailled config file explanation.*

---

## Start services and Run

Activate your python env if needed.
```sh
source agentic_seek_env/bin/activate
```

Start required services. This will start all services from the docker-compose.yml, including:
    - searxng
    - redis (required by searxng)
    - frontend

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh # MacOS
start ./start_services.cmd # Window
```

**Options 1:** Run with the CLI interface.

```sh
python3 cli.py
```

We advice you set `headless_browser` to False in the config.ini for CLI mode.

**Options 2:** Run with the Web interface.

Start the backend.

```sh
python3 api.py
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the web interface.

---

## Usage

Make sure the services are up and running with `./start_services.sh` and run the AgenticSeek with `python3 cli.py` for CLI mode or `python3 api.py` then go to `localhost:3000` for web interface.

You can also use speech to text by setting `listen = True` in the config. Only for CLI mode.

To exit, simply say/type `goodbye`.

Here are some example usage:

&gt; *Make a snake game in python!*

&gt; *Search the web for top cafes in Rennes, France, and save a list of three with their addresses in rennes_cafes.txt.*

&gt; *Write a Go program to calculate the factorial of a number, save it as factorial.go in your workspace*

&gt; *Search my summer_pictures folder for all JPG files, rename them with today‚Äôs date, and save a list of renamed files in photos_list.txt*

&gt; *Search online for popular sci-fi movies from 2024 and pick three to watch tonight. Save the list in movie_night.txt.*

&gt; *Search the web for the latest AI news articles from 2025, select three, and write a Python script to scrape their titles and summaries. Save the script as news_scraper.py and the summaries in ai_news.txt in /home/projects*

&gt; *Friday, search the web for a free stock price API, register with supersuper7434567@gmail.com then write a Python script to fetch using the API daily prices for Tesla, and save the results in stock_prices.csv*

*Note that form filling capabilities are still experimental and might fail.*



After you type your query, AgenticSeek will allocate the best agent for the task.

Because this is an early prototype, the agent routing system might not always allocate the right agent based on your query.

Therefore, you should be very explicit in what you want and how the AI might proceed for example if you want it to conduct a web search, do not say:

`Do you know some good countries for solo-travel?`

Instead, ask:

`Do a web search and find out which are the best country for solo-travel`

---

## **Setup to run the LLM on your own server**  

If you have a powerful computer or a server that you can use, but you want to use it from your laptop you have the options to run the LLM on a remote server using our custom llm server. 

On your &quot;server&quot; that will run the AI model, get the ip address

```sh
ip a | grep &quot;inet &quot; | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk &#039;{print $2}&#039; | cut -d/ -f1 # local ip
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip # public ip
```

Note: For Windows or macOS, use ipconfig or ifconfig respectively to find the IP address.

Clone the repository and enter the `server/`folder.


```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek/llm_server/
```

Install server specific requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server script.

```sh
python3 app.py --provider ollama --port 3333
```

You have the choice between using `ollama` and `llamacpp` as a LLM service.


Now on your personal computer:

Change the `config.ini` file to set the `provider_name` to `server` and `provider_model` to `deepseek-r1:xxb`.
Set the `provider_server_address` to the ip address of the machine that will run the model.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = server
provider_model = deepseek-r1:70b
provider_server_address = x.x.x.x:3333
```


Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

---

## Speech to Text

Please note that currently speech to text only work in english.

The speech-to-text functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, set the listen option to True in the config.ini file:

```
listen = True
```

When enabled, the speech-to-text feature listens for a trigger keyword, which is the agent&#039;s name, before it begins processing your input. You can customize the agent&#039;s name by updating the `agent_name` value in the *config.ini* file:

```
agent_name = Friday
```

For optimal recognition, we recommend using a common English name like &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Emma&quot; as the agent name

Once you see the transcript start to appear, say the agent&#039;s name aloud to wake it up (e.g., &quot;Friday&quot;).

Speak your query clearly.

End your request with a confirmation phrase to signal the system to proceed. Examples of confirmation phrases include:
```
&quot;do it&quot;, &quot;go ahead&quot;, &quot;execute&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;thanks&quot;, &quot;would ya&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, &quot;okay?&quot;, &quot;proceed&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, &quot;go on&quot;, &quot;do that&quot;, &quot;go it&quot;, &quot;do you understand?&quot;
```

## Config

Example config:
```
[MAIN]
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
agent_name = Friday
recover_last_session = False
save_session = False
speak = False
listen = False
work_dir =  /Users/mlg/Documents/ai_folder
jarvis_personality = False
languages = en zh
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = False
stealth_mode = False
```

**Explanation**:

- is_local -&gt; Runs the agent locally (True) or on a remote server (False).

- provider_name -&gt; The provider to use (one of: `ollama`, `server`, `lm-studio`, `deepseek-api`)

- provider_model -&gt; The model used, e.g., deepseek-r1:32b.

- provider_server_address -&gt; Server address, e.g., 127.0.0.1:11434 for local. Set to anything for non-local API.

- agent_name -&gt; Name of the agent, e.g., Friday. Used as a trigger word for TTS.

- recover_last_session -&gt; Restarts from last session (True) or not (False).

- save_session -&gt; Saves session data (True) or not (False).

- speak -&gt; Enables voice output (True) or not (False).

- listen -&gt; listen to voice input (True) or not (False).

- work_dir -&gt; Folder the AI will have access to. eg: /Users/user/Documents/.

- jarvis_personality -&gt; Uses a JARVIS-like personality (True) or not (False). This simply change the prompt file.

- languages -&gt; The list of supported language, needed for the llm router to work properly, avoid putting too many or too similar languages.

- headless_browser -&gt; Runs browser without a visible window (True) or not (False).

- stealth_mode -&gt; Make bot detector time harder. Only downside is you have to manually install the anticaptcha extension.

- languages -&gt; List of supported languages. Required for agent routing system. The longer the languages list the more model will be downloaded.

## Providers

The table below show the available providers:

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| server    | Yes    | Host the model on another machine, run your local machine |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (`lm-studio`)             |
| openai    | Depends  | Use ChatGPT API (non-private) or openai compatible API  |
| deepseek-api  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                            |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |
| togetherAI | No    | Use together AI API (non-private)                         |
| google | No    | Use google gemini API (non-private)                         |

To select a provider change the config.ini:

```
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000
```
`is_local`: should be True for any locally running LLM, otherwise False.

`provider_name`: Select the provider to use by it&#039;s name, see the provider list above.

`provider_model`: Set the model to use by the agent.

`provider_server_address`: can be set to anything if you are not using the server provider.

# Known issues

## Chromedriver Issues

**Known error #1:** *chromedriver mismatch*

`Exception: Failed to initialize browser: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 113
Current browser version is 134.0.6998.89 with binary path`

This happen if there is a mismatch between your browser and chromedriver version.

You need to navigate to download the latest version:

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

If you&#039;re using Chrome version 115 or newer go to:

https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

And download the chromedriver version matching your OS.

If this section is incomplete please raise an issue.

##  connection adapters Issues

```
Exception: Provider lm-studio failed: HTTP request failed: No connection adapters were found for &#039;127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions&#039;
```

Make sure you have `http://` in front of the provider IP address :

`provider_server_address = http://127.0.0.1:11434`

## SearxNG base URL must be provided

```
raise ValueError(&quot;SearxNG base URL must be provided either as an argument or via the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable.&quot;)
ValueError: SearxNG base URL must be provided either as an argument or via the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable.
```

Maybe you didn&#039;t move `.env.example` as `.env` ? You can also export SEARXNG_BASE_URL:

`export  SEARXNG_BASE_URL=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8080&quot;`

## FAQ

**Q: What hardware do I need?**  

| Model Size  | GPU  | Comment                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 7B        | 8GB Vram | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended. Performance is poor, frequent hallucinations, and planner agents will likely fail. |
| 14B        | 12 GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 3060) | ‚úÖ Usable for simple tasks. May struggle with web browsing and planning tasks. |
| 32B        | 24+ GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 4090) | üöÄ Success with most tasks, might still struggle with task planning |
| 70B+        | 48+ GB Vram (eg. mac studio) | üí™ Excellent. Recommended for advanced use cases. |

**Q: Why Deepseek R1 over other models?**  

Deepseek R1 excels at reasoning and tool use for its size. We think it‚Äôs a solid fit for our needs other models work fine, but Deepseek is our primary pick.

**Q: I get an error running `cli.py`. What do I do?**  

Ensure local is running (`ollama serve`), your `config.ini` matches your provider, and dependencies are installed. If none work feel free to raise an issue.

**Q: Can it really run 100% locally?**  

Yes with Ollama, lm-studio or server providers, all speech to text, LLM and text to speech model run locally. Non-local options (OpenAI or others API) are optional.

**Q: Why should I use AgenticSeek when I have Manus?**

This started as Side-Project we did out of interest about AI agents. What‚Äôs special about it is that we want to use local model and avoid APIs.
We draw inspiration from Jarvis and Friday (Iron man movies) to make it &quot;cool&quot; but

# üèÜ The Best Machine Learning Engineering Agent!

[MLE-bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench) is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating the performance of AI agents on machine learning engineering tasks. Utilizing datasets from 75 Kaggle competitions, MLE-bench provides robust assessments of AI systems&#039; capabilities in real-world ML engineering scenarios.

R&amp;D-Agent currently leads as the top-performing machine learning engineering agent on MLE-bench:

| Agent | Low == Lite (%) | Medium (%) | High (%) | All (%) |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| R&amp;D-Agent o1-preview | 48.18 ¬± 2.49 | 8.95 ¬± 2.36 | 18.67 ¬± 2.98 | 22.4 ¬± 1.1 |
| R&amp;D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) | 51.52 ¬± 6.21 | 7.89 ¬± 3.33 | 16.67 ¬± 3.65 | 22.45 ¬± 2.45 |
| AIDE o1-preview | 34.3 ¬± 2.4 | 8.8 ¬± 1.1 | 10.0 ¬± 1.9 | 16.9 ¬± 1.1 |

**Notes:**
- **O3(R)+GPT-4.1(D)**: This version is designed to both reduce average time per loop and leverage a cost-effective combination of backend LLMs by seamlessly integrating Research Agent (o3) with Development Agent (GPT-4.1).
- **AIDE o1-preview**: Represents the previously best public result on MLE-bench as reported in the original MLE-bench paper.
- Average and standard deviation results for R&amp;D-Agent o1-preview is based on a independent of 5 seeds and for R&amp;D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) is based on 6 seeds.
- According to MLE-Bench, the 75 competitions are categorized into three levels of complexity: **Low==Lite** if we estimate that an experienced ML engineer can produce a sensible solution in under 2 hours, excluding the time taken to train any models; **Medium** if it takes between 2 and 10 hours; and **High** if it takes more than 10 hours.

You can inspect the detailed runs of the above results online.

# Data Science Agent Preview
Check out our demo video showcasing the current progress of our Data Science Agent under development:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eccbecb-34a4-4c81-bce4-d3f8862f7305

# üåü Introduction
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/scen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our focused scenario&quot; style=&quot;width:80%; &quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

R&amp;D-Agent aims to automate the most critical and valuable aspects of the industrial R&amp;D process, and we begin with focusing on the data-driven scenarios to streamline the development of models and data. 
Methodologically, we have identified a framework with two key components: &#039;R&#039; for proposing new ideas and &#039;D&#039; for implementing them.
We believe that the automatic evolution of R&amp;D will lead to solutions of significant industrial value.


&lt;!-- Tag Cloud --&gt;
R&amp;D is a very general scenario. The advent of R&amp;D-Agent can be your

You can click the links above to view the demo. We&#039;re continuously adding more methods and scenarios to the project to enhance your R&amp;D processes and boost productivity. 

Additionally, you can take a closer look at the examples in our **[üñ•Ô∏è Live Demo](https://rdagent.azurewebsites.net/)**.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://rdagent.azurewebsites.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;docs/_static/demo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Watch the demo&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


# ‚ö° Quick start

You can try above demos by running the following command:

### üê≥ Docker installation.
Users must ensure Docker is installed before attempting most scenarios. Please refer to the [official üê≥Docker page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation instructions.
Ensure the current user can run Docker commands **without using sudo**. You can verify this by executing `docker run hello-world`.

### üêç Create a Conda Environment
- Create a new conda environment with Python (3.10 and 3.11 are well-tested in our CI):
  ```sh
  conda create -n rdagent python=3.10
  ```
- Activate the environment:
  ```sh
  conda activate rdagent
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Install the R&amp;D-Agent
- You can directly install the R&amp;D-Agent package from PyPI:
  ```sh
  pip install rdagent
  ```

### üíä Health check
- rdagent provides a health check that currently checks two things.
  - whether the docker installation was successful.
  - whether the default port used by the [rdagent ui](https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-monitor-the-application-results) is occupied.
  ```sh
  rdagent health_check
  ```


### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- The demos requires following ability:
  - ChatCompletion
  - json_mode
  - embedding query

- For example: If you are using the `OpenAI API`, you have to configure your GPT model in the `.env` file like this.
  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_openai_api_key&gt;
  # EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo
  EOF
  ```
- However, not every API services support these features by default. For example: `AZURE OpenAI`, you have to configure your GPT model in the `.env` file like this.
  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  USE_AZURE=True
  EMBEDDING_OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_azure_openai_api_key&gt;
  EMBEDDING_AZURE_API_BASE=&lt;replace_with_your_azure_endpoint&gt;
  EMBEDDING_AZURE_API_VERSION=&lt;replace_with_the_version_of_your_azure_openai_api&gt;
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  CHAT_OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_azure_openai_api_key&gt;
  CHAT_AZURE_API_BASE=&lt;replace_with_your_azure_endpoint&gt;
  CHAT_AZURE_API_VERSION=&lt;replace_with_the_version_of_your_azure_openai_api&gt;
  CHAT_MODEL=&lt;replace_it_with_the_name_of_your_azure_chat_model&gt;
  EOF
  ```

- We now support LiteLLM as a backend for integration with multiple LLM providers. If you use LiteLLM Backend to use models, you can configure as follows:
  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt; .env
  BACKEND=rdagent.oai.backend.LiteLLMAPIBackend
  # It can be modified to any model supported by LiteLLM.
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  # The backend api_key fully follow the convention of litellm.
  OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;replace_with_your_openai_api_key&gt;
  ```
  
- For more configuration information, please refer to the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_and_configuration.html).

### üöÄ Run the Application

The **[üñ•Ô∏è Live Demo](https://rdagent.azurewebsites.net/)** is implemented by the following commands(each item represents one demo, you can select the one you prefer):

- Run the **Automated Quantitative Trading &amp; Iterative Factors Evolution**:  [Qlib](http://github.com/microsoft/qlib) self-loop factor proposal and implementation application
  ```sh
  rdagent fin_factor
  ```

- Run the **Automated Quantitative Trading &amp; Iterative Model Evolution**: [Qlib](http://github.com/microsoft/qlib) self-loop model proposal and implementation application
  ```sh
  rdagent fin_model
  ```

- Run the **Automated Medical Prediction Model Evolution**: Medical self-loop model proposal and implementation application
  &gt;(1) Apply for an account at [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/). &lt;br /&gt; (2) Request access to FIDDLE preprocessed data: [FIDDLE Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-eicu-fiddle-feature/1.0.0/). &lt;br /&gt;
  (3) Place your username and password in `.env`.
  ```bash
  cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt;&gt; .env
  DM_USERNAME=&lt;your_username&gt;
  DM_PASSWORD=&lt;your_password&gt;
  EOF
  ```
  ```sh
  rdagent med_model
  ```

- Run the **Automated Quantitative Trading &amp; Factors Extraction from Financial Reports**:  Run the [Qlib](http://github.com/microsoft/qlib) factor extraction and implementation application based on financial reports
  ```sh
  # 1. Generally, you can run this scenario using the following command:
  rdagent fin_factor_report --report_folder=&lt;Your financial reports folder path&gt;

  # 2. Specifically, you need to prepare some financial reports first. You can follow this concrete example:
  wget https://github.com/SunsetWolf/rdagent_resource/releases/download/reports/all_reports.zip
  unzip all_reports.zip -d git_ignore_folder/reports
  rdagent fin_factor_report --report_folder=git_ignore_folder/reports
  ```

- Run the **Automated Model Research &amp; Development Copilot**: model extraction and implementation application
  ```sh
  # 1. Generally, you can run your own papers/reports with the following command:
  rdagent general_model &lt;Your paper URL&gt;

  # 2. Specifically, you can do it like this. For more details and additional paper examples, use `rdagent general_model -h`:
  rdagent general_model  &quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09789&quot;
  ```

- Run the **Automated Kaggle Model Tuning &amp; Feature Engineering**:  self-loop model proposal and feature engineering implementation application &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; Using **sf-crime** *(San Francisco Crime Classification)* as an example. &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; 1. Register and login on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) website. &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; 2. Configuring the Kaggle API. &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; (1) Click on the avatar (usually in the top right corner of the page) -&gt; `Settings` -&gt; `Create New Token`, A file called `kaggle.json` will be downloaded. &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; (2) Move `kaggle.json` to `~/.config/kaggle/` &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; (3) Modify the permissions of the kaggle.json file. Reference command: `chmod 600 ~/.config/kaggle/kaggle.json` &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; 3. Join the competition: Click `Join the competition` -&gt; `I Understand and Accept` at the bottom of the [competition details page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sf-crime/data).
  ```bash
  # Generally, you can run the Kaggle competition program with the following command:
  rdagent kaggle --competition &lt;your competition name&gt;

  # Specifically, you need to create a folder for storing competition files (e.g., competition description file, competition datasets, etc.), and configure the path to the folder in your environment. In addition, you need to use chromedriver when you download the competition descriptors, which you can follow for this specific example:
  
  # 1. Install chromedriver.

  # 2. Add the competition description file path to the `.env` file.
  mkdir -p ./git_ignore_folder/kaggle_data
  dotenv set KG_LOCAL_DATA_PATH &quot;$(pwd)/git_ignore_folder/kaggle_data&quot;

  # 3. run the application
  rdagent kaggle --competition sf-crime
  ```
  &gt; **Description of the above example:** &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; - Kaggle competition data is roughly divided into three sections: competition description file (json file) and complete dataset for the competition and simplified dataset for the competition. &lt;br /&gt;
  &gt; - The Kaggle competition data will be downloaded automatically, the download process depends on `chromedriver`, installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scens/kaggle_agent.html#example-guide). &lt;br /&gt;

### üñ•Ô∏è Monitor the Application Results
- You can run the following command for our demo program to see the run logs.

  ```sh
  rdagent ui --port 19899 --log_dir &lt;your log folder like &quot;log/&quot;&gt;
  ```

  **Note:** Although port 19899 is not commonly used, but before you run this demo, you need to check if port 19899 is occupied. If it is, please change it to another port that is not occupied.

  You can check if a port is occupied by running the following command.

  ```sh
  rdagent health_check
  ```

# üè≠ Scenarios

We have applied R&amp;D-Agent to multiple valuable data-driven industrial scenarios.


## üéØ Goal: Agent for Data-driven R&amp;D

In this project, we are aiming to build an Agent to automate Data-Driven R\&amp;D that can
+ üìÑ Read real-world material (reports, papers, etc.) and **extract** key formulas, descriptions of interested **features** and **models**, which are the key components of data-driven R&amp;D .
+ üõ†Ô∏è **Implement** the extracted formulas (e.g., features, factors, and models) in runnable codes.
   + Due to the limited ability of LLM in implementing at once, build an evolving process for the agent to improve performance by learning from feedback and knowledge.
+ üí° Propose **new ideas** based on current knowledge and observations.

&lt;!-- ![Data-Centric R&amp;D Overview](docs/_static/overview.png) --&gt;

## üìà Scenarios/Demos

In the two key areas of data-driven scenarios, model implementation and data building, our system aims to serve two main roles: ü¶æCopilot and ü§ñAgent. 
- The ü¶æCopilot follows human instructions to automate repetitive tasks. 
- The ü§ñAgent, being more autonomous, actively proposes ideas for better results in the future.

The supported scenarios are listed below:

| Scenario/Target | Model Implementation                   | Data Building                                                                      |
| --              | --                                     | --                                                                                 |

Welcome to the Sigma main rule repository. The place where detection engineers, threat hunters and all defensive security practitioners collaborate on detection rules. The repository offers more than 3000 detection rules of different type and aims to make reliable detections accessible to all at no cost.

Currently the repository offers three types of rules:

* [Generic Detection Rules](./rules/) - Are threat agnostic, their aim is to detect a behavior or an implementation of a technique or procedure that was, can or will be used by a potential threat actor.
* [Threat Hunting Rules](./rules-threat-hunting/) - Are broader in scope and are meant to give the analyst a starting point to hunt for potential suspicious or malicious activity
* [Emerging Threat Rules](./rules-emerging-threats/) - Are rules that cover specific threats, that are timely and relevant for certain periods of time. These threats include specific APT campaigns, exploitation of Zero-Day vulnerabilities, specific malware used during an attack,...etc.

## Explore Sigma

To start exploring the Sigma ecosystem, please visit the official website [sigmahq.io](https://sigmahq.io)

### What is Sigma

Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file.

The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.

Sigma is for log files what [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) is for network traffic and [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) is for files.

&lt;picture&gt;

  &lt;img alt=&quot;Sigma Description - A diagram showing Yaml Files (Sigma Rules) moving through a Sigma Convertor, and coming out as many SIEM logos, showing how Sigma rules can be converted to many different available SIEM query languages&quot; src=&quot;./images/Sigma_description_light.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

### Why Sigma

Today, everyone collects log data for analysis. People start working on their own, processing numerous white papers, blog posts and log analysis guidelines, extracting the necessary information and build their own searches and dashboard. Some of their searches and correlations are great and very useful but they lack a standardized format in which they can share their work with others.

Others provide excellent analyses, include IOCs and YARA rules to detect the malicious files and network connections, but have no way to describe a specific or generic detection method in log events. Sigma is meant to be an open standard in which such detection mechanisms can be defined, shared and collected in order to improve the detection capabilities for everyone.

### üåü Key Features

* A continuously growing list of detection and hunting rules, peer reviewed by a community of professional Detection Engineers.
* Vendor agnostic detection rules.

**DeepEval** is a simple-to-use, open-source LLM evaluation framework, for evaluating and testing large-language model systems. It is similar to Pytest but specialized for unit testing LLM outputs. DeepEval incorporates the latest research to evaluate LLM outputs based on metrics such as G-Eval, hallucination, answer relevancy, RAGAS, etc., which uses LLMs and various other NLP models that runs **locally on your machine** for evaluation.

Whether your LLM applications are RAG pipelines, chatbots, AI agents, implemented via LangChain or LlamaIndex, DeepEval has you covered. With it, you can easily determine the optimal models, prompts, and architecture to improve your RAG pipeline, agentic workflows, prevent prompt drifting, or even transition from OpenAI to hosting your own Deepseek R1 with confidence.

# üîå Integrations

- ü¶Ñ LlamaIndex, to [**unit test RAG applications in CI/CD**](https://www.deepeval.com/integrations/frameworks/llamaindex?utm_source=GitHub)
- ü§ó Hugging Face, to [**enable real-time evaluations during LLM fine-tuning**](https://www.deepeval.com/integrations/frameworks/huggingface?utm_source=GitHub)

&lt;br /&gt;

# üöÄ QuickStart

Let&#039;s pretend your LLM application is a RAG based customer support chatbot; here&#039;s how DeepEval can help test what you&#039;ve built.

## Installation

```
pip install -U deepeval
```

## Create an account (highly recommended)

Using the `deepeval` platform will allow you to generate sharable testing reports on the cloud. It is free, takes no additional code to setup, and we highly recommend giving it a try.

To login, run:

```
deepeval login
```

Follow the instructions in the CLI to create an account, copy your API key, and paste it into the CLI. All test cases will automatically be logged (find more information on data privacy [here](https://deepeval.com/docs/data-privacy?utm_source=GitHub)).

## Writing your first test case

Create a test file:

```bash
touch test_chatbot.py
```

Open `test_chatbot.py` and write your first test case to run an **end-to-end** evaluation using DeepEval, which treats your LLM app as a black-box:

```python
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams

def test_case():
    correctness_metric = GEval(
        name=&quot;Correctness&quot;,
        criteria=&quot;Determine if the &#039;actual output&#039; is correct based on the &#039;expected output&#039;.&quot;,
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
        threshold=0.5
    )
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=&quot;What if these shoes don&#039;t fit?&quot;,
        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
        actual_output=&quot;You have 30 days to get a full refund at no extra cost.&quot;,
        expected_output=&quot;We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.&quot;,
        retrieval_context=[&quot;All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.&quot;]
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric])
```

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable (you can also evaluate using your own custom model, for more details visit [this part of our docs](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm?utm_source=GitHub)):

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;...&quot;
```

And finally, run `test_chatbot.py` in the CLI:

```
deepeval test run test_chatbot.py
```

**Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ‚úÖ** Let&#039;s breakdown what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your application&#039;s supposed to output based on this input.
- The variable `expected_output` represents the ideal answer for a given `input`, and [`GEval`](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals) is a research-backed metric provided by `deepeval` for you to evaluate your LLM output&#039;s on any custom custom with human-like accuracy.
- In this example, the metric `criteria` is correctness of the `actual_output` based on the provided `expected_output`.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

[Read our documentation](https://deepeval.com/docs/getting-started?utm_source=GitHub) for more information on more options to run end-to-end evaluation, how to use additional metrics, create your own custom metrics, and tutorials on how to integrate with other tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex.

If you wish to evaluate individual components within your LLM app, you need to run **component-level** evals - a powerful way to evaluate any component within an LLM system.

Simply trace &quot;components&quot; such as LLM calls, retrievers, tool calls, and agents within your LLM application using the `@observe` decorator to apply metrics on a component-level. Tracing with `deepeval` is non-instrusive (learn more [here](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing#dont-be-worried-about-tracing)) and helps you avoid rewriting your codebase just for evals:

```python
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval import evaluate

correctness = GEval(name=&quot;Correctness&quot;, criteria=&quot;Determine if the &#039;actual output&#039; is correct based on the &#039;expected output&#039;.&quot;, evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT])

@observe(metrics=[correctness])
def inner_component():
    # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.
    update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input=&quot;...&quot;, actual_output=&quot;...&quot;))
    return

@observe
def llm_app(input: str):
    inner_component()
    return

evaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden(input=&quot;Hi!&quot;)])
```

You can learn everything about component-level evaluations [here.](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals)

&lt;br /&gt;

## Evaluating Without Pytest Integration

Alternatively, you can evaluate without Pytest, which is more suited for a notebook environment.

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=&quot;What if these shoes don&#039;t fit?&quot;,
    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output=&quot;We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.&quot;,
    retrieval_context=[&quot;All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.&quot;]
)
evaluate([test_case], [answer_relevancy_metric])
```

## Using Standalone Metrics

DeepEval is extremely modular, making it easy for anyone to use any of our metrics. Continuing from the previous example:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=&quot;What if these shoes don&#039;t fit?&quot;,
    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output=&quot;We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.&quot;,
    retrieval_context=[&quot;All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.&quot;]
)

answer_relevancy_metric.measure(test_case)
print(answer_relevancy_metric.score)
# All metrics also offer an explanation
print(answer_relevancy_metric.reason)
```

Note that some metrics are for RAG pipelines, while others are for fine-tuning. Make sure to use our docs to pick the right one for your use case.

## Evaluating a Dataset / Test Cases in Bulk

In DeepEval, a dataset is simply a collection of test cases. Here is how you can evaluate these in bulk:

```python
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric, AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

first_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=&quot;...&quot;, actual_output=&quot;...&quot;, context=[&quot;...&quot;])
second_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=&quot;...&quot;, actual_output=&quot;...&quot;, context=[&quot;...&quot;])

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[first_test_case, second_test_case])

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    &quot;test_case&quot;,
    dataset,
)
def test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):
    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.3)
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)
    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])
```

```bash
# Run this in the CLI, you can also add an optional -n flag to run tests in parallel
deepeval test run test_&lt;filename&gt;.py -n 4
```

&lt;br/&gt;

Alternatively, although we recommend using `deepeval test run`, you can evaluate a dataset/test cases without using our Pytest integration:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate(dataset, [answer_relevancy_metric])
# or
dataset.evaluate([answer_relevancy_metric])
```

## Inference
The [LLaDA-8B-Base](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Base) and [LLaDA-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Instruct) are uploaded
in Huggingface. Please first install `transformers==4.38.2` and employ the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to load.

```angular2html
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&#039;GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Base&#039;, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(&#039;GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Base&#039;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
```

We provide `get_log_likelihood()` and `generate()` functions in `get_log_likelihood.py` 
and `generate.py` respectively, for conditional likelihood evaluation and conditional generation.

You can directly run `python chat.py` to have multi-round conversations with LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

In addition, please refer to our paper and [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md) for more details about the inference methods.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning

We will not provide the training framework and data as most open-source LLMs do.

However, the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLaDA are straightforward. If 
you have a codebase for training an autoregressive model, you can modify it to 
adapt to LLaDA with just a few lines of code.

We provide guidelines for the pre-training and SFT of LLaDA in [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md). 
You can also refer to [SMDM](https://github.com/ML-GSAI/SMDM), which has a similar training process to LLaDA 
and has open-sourced the training framework.

## Evaluation

We use two evaluation methods: conditional likelihood estimation and conditional generation. For the base model, conditional likelihood estimation is applied to specific metrics and conditional generation to the rest. For the Instruct model, conditional generation is used for all metrics.

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992), we implement conditional likelihood estimation using the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) library, while conditional generation is performed with an internal library, as lm-evaluation-harness lacks support for certain metrics (i.e., HumanEval-FIM). Please refer to Appendix B.5. of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992) for all evaluation details.

**2025.05.04.** We now provide evaluation code based on the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) for the LLaDA-Base, including conditional likelihood estimation and conditional generation. However, for the Instruct model (both LLama3-Instruct and LLaDA-Instruct), we encountered some bugs. We are still debugging the issue. 

Please refer to [EVAL.md](EVAL.md) for the usage of the evaluation code and the BUG details. Any help in resolving this bug would be sincerely appreciated.

## FAQ
Here, we address some common questions about LLaDA.

### 0. How do I train my own LLaDA?
Please refer to [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md) for the guidelines. 
You can also refer to [SMDM](https://github.com/ML-GSAI/SMDM), which follows the same training 
process as LLaDA and has open-sourced its code.


### 1. What is the difference between LLaDA and BERT?

Our motivation is not to improve BERT, nor to apply image generation methods like [MaskGIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04200) 
to text. **Our goal is to explore a theoretically complete language modeling approach ‚Äî masked diffusion models.** 
During this process, we simplified the approach and discovered that the loss function of masked diffusion models 
is related to the loss functions of BERT and MaskGIT. You can find our theoretical research process in Question 7.

Specifically, LLaDA employs a masking ratio that varies randomly between 0 and 1, while BERT uses 
a fixed ratio. This subtle difference has significant implications. **The training
objective of LLaDA is an upper bound on the negative log-likelihood of the model 
distribution, making LLaDA a generative model.** This enables LLaDA to naturally 
perform in-context learning, instruction-following, and ensures Fisher consistency 
for scalability with large datasets and models. You can also find a direct answer 
to this question in Section 2.1 of our paper.


### 2. What is the relationship between LLaDA and Transformer?
Network structure and probabilistic modeling are two distinct approaches that collectively form the 
foundation of language models. LLaDA, like GPT, adopts the 
Transformer architecture. The key difference lies in the probabilistic modeling approach: GPT 
utilizes an autoregressive next-token prediction method, 
while LLaDA employs a diffusion model for probabilistic modeling.


### 3. What is the sampling efficiency of LLaDA?
Currently, LLaDA&#039;s sampling speed is slower than the autoregressive baseline for three reasons: 
1. LLaDA samples with a fixed context length;
2. LLaDA cannot yet leverage techniques like KV-Cache;
3. LLaDA achieves optimal performance when the number of sampling steps equals the response length.
Reducing the number of sampling steps leads to a decrease in performance, as detailed in Appendix B.4 
and Appendix B.6 of our paper.

In this work, we aim to explore the upper limits of LLaDA&#039;s capabilities, **challenging the assumption 
that the key LLM abilities are inherently tied to autoregressive models**. We will continue 
to optimize its efficiency in the future. We believe this research approach is reasonable, 
as verifying the upper limits of diffusion language models&#039; capabilities will provide us with
more resources and sufficient motivation to optimize efficiency.

Recall the development of diffusion models for images, from [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) 
to the [Consistency model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11081), where sampling speed accelerated nearly 
1000 times over the course of 4 years. **We believe there is significant room for optimization in LLaDA&#039;s 
sampling efficiency as well**. Current solutions, including semi-autoregressive sampling (as 
detailed in [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md)), can mitigate the fixed context length issue, and 
[consistency distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05415) can reduce the number of sampling steps. In
addition, some [cache methods](https://github.com/maomaocun/dLLM-cache) can also be adapted by LLaDA.


### 4. What is the training stability of LLaDA?
For details on the pre-training process of LLaDA, please refer to Section 2.2 of our paper. 
During the total pre-training on 2.3T tokens, we encountered a training crash (loss becoming NaN) 
only once at 1.2T tokens. Our solution was to resume the checkpoint and reduce 
the learning rate from 4e-4 to 1e-4.


### 5. Why is the final answer &quot;72&quot; generated earlier than the intermediate calculation step (e.g., 12 √ó 4 = 48) in Tab4?

**The mask predictor has successfully predicted the reasoning process. However, during the 
remasking process, the reasoning steps are masked out again.** As shown in the figure 
below, the non-white background represents the model&#039;s generation process, while the 
white-background boxes indicate the predictions made by the mask predictor at each step. 
We adopt a randomly remasking strategy.

&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./imgs/diff_remask.gif&quot; style=&quot;width: 80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

### 6. Why does LLaDA answer &#039;Bailing&#039; when asked &#039;Who are you&#039;?
This is because our pre-training and SFT data were designed for training an autoregressive model, 
whereas LLaDA directly utilizes data that contains identity markers.


### 7. Our journey in developing LLaDA?
LLaDA is built upon our two prior works, [RADD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03736) and 
[SMDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18514). 

RADD demonstrated that the **training objective of LLaDA serves as an upper bound on the negative 
log-likelihood** of the model‚Äôs distribution, a conclusion also supported by [MD4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04329) 
and [MDLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07524). 
Furthermore, RADD was the first to theoretically prove that **masked diffusion models do not require time t 
as an input to Transformer**. This insight provides the theoretical 
justification for LLaDA‚Äôs unmodified use of the Transformer architecture. Lastly, 
RADD showed that **the training objective of masked diffusion models is equivalent to that of 
any-order autoregressive models**, offering valuable insights into how masked diffusion models can 
overcome the reversal curse.

SMDM introduces the first **scaling law** for masked diffusion models and demonstrates that, with the 
same model size and training data, masked diffusion models can achieve downstream benchmark results 
on par with those of autoregressive models. Additionally, SMDM presents a simple, **unsupervised 
classifier-free guidance** method that greatly improves downstream benchmark performance, which has 
been adopted by LLaDA.

## Overview

**`mcp-agent`** is a simple, composable framework to build agents using [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

**Inspiration**: Anthropic announced 2 foundational updates for AI application developers:

1. [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) - a standardized interface to let any software be accessible to AI assistants via MCP servers.
2. [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) - a seminal writeup on simple, composable patterns for building production-ready AI agents.

`mcp-agent` puts these two foundational pieces into an AI application framework:

1. It handles the pesky business of managing the lifecycle of MCP server connections so you don&#039;t have to.
2. It implements every pattern described in Building Effective Agents, and does so in a _composable_ way, allowing you to chain these patterns together.
3. **Bonus**: It implements [OpenAI&#039;s Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) pattern for multi-agent orchestration, but in a model-agnostic way.

Altogether, this is the simplest and easiest way to build robust agent applications. Much like MCP, this project is in early development.
We welcome all kinds of [contributions](/CONTRIBUTING.md), feedback and your help in growing this to become a new standard.

## Get Started

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects:

```bash
uv add &quot;mcp-agent&quot;
```

Alternatively:

```bash
pip install mcp-agent
```

### Quickstart

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; The [`examples`](/examples) directory has several example applications to get started with.
&gt; To run an example, clone this repo, then:
&gt;
&gt; ```bash
&gt; cd examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent # Or any other example
&gt; cp mcp_agent.secrets.yaml.example mcp_agent.secrets.yaml # Update API keys
&gt; uv run main.py
&gt; ```

Here is a basic &quot;finder&quot; agent that uses the fetch and filesystem servers to look up a file, read a blog and write a tweet. [Example link](./examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent/):

&lt;details open&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;finder_agent.py&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
import asyncio
import os

from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp
from mcp_agent.agents.agent import Agent
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm_openai import OpenAIAugmentedLLM

app = MCPApp(name=&quot;hello_world_agent&quot;)

async def example_usage():
    async with app.run() as mcp_agent_app:
        logger = mcp_agent_app.logger
        # This agent can read the filesystem or fetch URLs
        finder_agent = Agent(
            name=&quot;finder&quot;,
            instruction=&quot;&quot;&quot;You can read local files or fetch URLs.
                Return the requested information when asked.&quot;&quot;&quot;,
            server_names=[&quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;filesystem&quot;], # MCP servers this Agent can use

## Why use `mcp-agent`?

There are too many AI frameworks out there already. But `mcp-agent` is the only one that is purpose-built for a shared protocol - [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It is also the most lightweight, and is closer to an agent pattern library than a framework.

As [more services become MCP-aware](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers), you can use mcp-agent to build robust and controllable AI agents that can leverage those services out-of-the-box.

## Examples

Before we go into the core concepts of mcp-agent, let&#039;s show what you can build with it.

In short, you can build any kind of AI application with mcp-agent: multi-agent collaborative workflows, human-in-the-loop workflows, RAG pipelines and more.

### Claude Desktop

You can integrate mcp-agent apps into MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

#### mcp-agent server

This app wraps an mcp-agent application inside an MCP server, and exposes that server to Claude Desktop.
The app exposes agents and workflows that Claude Desktop can invoke to service of the user&#039;s request.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7807cffd-dba7-4f0c-9c70-9482fd7e0699

This demo shows a multi-agent evaluation task where each agent evaluates aspects of an input poem, and
then an aggregator summarizes their findings into a final response.

**Details**: Starting from a user&#039;s request over text, the application:

- dynamically defines agents to do the job
- uses the appropriate workflow to orchestrate those agents (in this case the Parallel workflow)

&gt; for developing and contributing this example!

### Streamlit

You can deploy mcp-agent apps using Streamlit.

#### Gmail agent

This app is able to perform read and write actions on gmail using text prompts -- i.e. read, delete, send emails, mark as read/unread, etc.
It uses an MCP server for Gmail.

### Marimo

[Marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) is a reactive Python notebook that replaces Jupyter and Streamlit.
Here&#039;s the &quot;file finder&quot; agent from [Quickstart](#quickstart) implemented in Marimo:

### Python

You can write mcp-agent apps as Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

#### Swarm

This example demonstrates a multi-agent setup for handling different customer service requests in an airline context using the Swarm workflow pattern. The agents can triage requests, handle flight modifications, cancellations, and lost baggage cases.

## Core Components

The following are the building blocks of the mcp-agent framework:

- **[MCPApp](./src/mcp_agent/app.py)**: global state and app configuration
- **MCP server management**: [`gen_client`](./src/mcp_agent/mcp/gen_client.py) and [`MCPConnectionManager`](./src/mcp_agent/mcp/mcp_connection_manager.py) to easily connect to MCP servers.
- **[Agent](./src/mcp_agent/agents/agent.py)**: An Agent is an entity that has access to a set of MCP servers and exposes them to an LLM as tool calls. It has a name and purpose (instruction).
- **[AugmentedLLM](./src/mcp_agent/workflows/llm/augmented_llm.py)**: An LLM that is enhanced with tools provided from a collection of MCP servers. Every Workflow pattern described below is an `AugmentedLLM` itself, allowing you to compose and chain them together.

Everything in the framework is a derivative of these core capabilities.

## Workflows

mcp-agent provides implementations for every pattern in Anthropic‚Äôs [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), as well as the OpenAI [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) pattern.
Each pattern is model-agnostic, and exposed as an `AugmentedLLM`, making everything very composable.

### AugmentedLLM

[AugmentedLLM](./src/mcp_agent/workflows/llm/augmented_llm.py) is an LLM that has access to MCP servers and functions via Agents.

LLM providers implement the AugmentedLLM interface to expose 3 functions:

- `generate`: Generate message(s) given a prompt, possibly over multiple iterations and making tool calls as needed.
- `generate_str`: Calls `generate` and returns result as a string output.
- `generate_structured`: Uses [Instructor](https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor) to return the generated result as a Pydantic model.

Additionally, `AugmentedLLM` has memory, to keep track of long or short-term history.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Example&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
from mcp_agent.agents.agent import Agent
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm_anthropic import AnthropicAugmentedLLM

finder_agent = Agent(
    name=&quot;finder&quot;,
    instruction=&quot;You are an agent with filesystem + fetch access. Return the requested file or URL contents.&quot;,
    server_names=[&quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;filesystem&quot;],
)

async with finder_agent:
   llm = await finder_agent.attach_llm(AnthropicAugmentedLLM)

   result = await llm.generate_str(
      message=&quot;Print the first 2 paragraphs of https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents&quot;,
      # Can override model, tokens and other defaults
   )
   logger.info(f&quot;Result: {result}&quot;)

   # Multi-turn conversation
   result = await llm.generate_str(
      message=&quot;Summarize those paragraphs in a 128 character tweet&quot;,
   )
   logger.info(f&quot;Result: {result}&quot;)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### [Parallel](src/mcp_agent/workflows/parallel/parallel_llm.py)

![Parallel workflow (Image credit: Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F406bb032ca007fd1624f261af717d70e6ca86286-2401x1000.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75)

Fan-out tasks to multiple sub-agents and fan-in the results. Each subtask is an AugmentedLLM, as is the overall Parallel workflow, meaning each subtask can optionally be a more complex workflow itself.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **[Link to full example](examples/workflows/workflow_parallel/main.py)**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Example&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
proofreader = Agent(name=&quot;proofreader&quot;, instruction=&quot;Review grammar...&quot;)
fact_checker = Agent(name=&quot;fact_checker&quot;, instruction=&quot;Check factual consistency...&quot;)
style_enforcer = Agent(name=&quot;style_enforcer&quot;, instruction=&quot;Enforce style guidelines...&quot;)

grader = Agent(name=&quot;grader&quot;, instruction=&quot;Combine feedback into a structured report.&quot;)

parallel = ParallelLLM(
    fan_in_agent=grader,
    fan_out_agents=[proofreader, fact_checker, style_enforcer],
    llm_factory=OpenAIAugmentedLLM,
)

result = await parallel.generate_str(&quot;Student short story submission: ...&quot;, RequestParams(model=&quot;gpt4-o&quot;))
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### [Router](src/mcp_agent/workflows/router/)

![Router workflow (Image credit: Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5c0c0e9fe4def0b584c04d37849941da55e5e71c-2401x1000.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75)

Given an input, route to the `top_k` most relevant categories. A category can be an Agent, an MCP server or a regular function.

mcp-agent provides several router implementations, including:

- [`EmbeddingRouter`](src/mcp_agent/workflows/router/router_embedding.py): uses embedding models for classification
- [`LLMRouter`](src/mcp_agent/workflows/router/router_llm.py): uses LLMs for classification

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **[Link to full example](examples/workflows/workflow_router/main.py)**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Example&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
def print_hello_world:
     print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

finder_agent = Agent(name=&quot;finder&quot;, server_names=[&quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;filesystem&quot;])
writer_agent = Agent(name=&quot;writer&quot;, server_names=[&quot;filesystem&quot;])

llm = OpenAIAugmentedLLM()
router = LLMRouter(
    llm=llm,
    agents=[finder_agent, writer_agent],
    functions=[print_hello_world],
)

results = await router.route( # Also available: route_to_agent, route_to_server
    request=&quot;Find and print the contents of README.md verbatim&quot;,
    top_k=1
)
chosen_agent = results[0].result
async with chosen_agent:
    ...
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### [IntentClassifier](src/mcp_agent/workflows/intent_classifier/)

A close sibling of Router, the Intent Classifier pattern identifies the `top_k` Intents that most closely match a given input.
Just like a Router, mcp-agent provides both an [embedding](src/mcp_agent/workflows/intent_classifier/intent_classifier_embedding.py) and [LLM-based](src/mcp_agent/workflows/intent_classifier/intent_classifier_llm.py) intent classifier.

### [Evaluator-Optimizer](src/mcp_agent/workflows/evaluator_optimizer/evaluator_optimizer.py)

![Evaluator-optimizer workflow (Image credit: Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F14f51e6406ccb29e695da48b17017e899a6119c7-2401x1000.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75)

One LLM (the ‚Äúoptimizer‚Äù) refines a response, another (the ‚Äúevaluator‚Äù) critiques it until a response exceeds a quality criteria.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **[Link to full example](examples/workflows/workflow_evaluator_optimizer/main.py)**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Example&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
optimizer = Agent(name=&quot;cover_letter_writer&quot;, server_names=[&quot;fetch&quot;], instruction=&quot;Generate a cover letter ...&quot;)
evaluator = Agent(name=&quot;critiquer&quot;, instruction=&quot;Evaluate clarity, specificity, relevance...&quot;)

llm = EvaluatorOptimizerLLM(
    optimizer=optimizer,
    evaluator=evaluator,
    llm_factory=OpenAIAugmentedLLM,
    min_rating=QualityRating.EXCELLENT, # Keep iterating until the minimum quality bar is reached
)

result = await eo_llm.generate_str(&quot;Write a job cover letter for an AI framework developer role at LastMile AI.&quot;)
print(&quot;Final refined cover letter:&quot;, result)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### [Orchestrator-workers](src/mcp_agent/workflows/orchestrator/orchestrator.py)

![Orchestrator workflow (Image credit: Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8985fc683fae4780fb34eab1365ab78c7e51bc8e-2401x1000.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75)

A higher-level LLM generates a plan, then assigns them to sub-agents, and synthesizes the results.
The Orchestrator workflow automatically parallelizes steps that can be done in parallel, and blocks on dependencies.

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt;
&gt; **[Link to full example](examples/workflows/workflow_orchestrator_worker/main.py)**

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Example&lt;/summary&gt;

```python
finder_agent = Agent(name=&quot;finder&quot;, server_names=[&quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;filesystem&quot;])
writer_agent = Agent(name=&quot;writer&quot;, server_names=[&quot;filesystem&quot;])
proofreader = Agent(name=&quot;proofreader&quot;, ...)
fact_checker = Agent(name=&quot;fact_checker&quot;, ...)
style_enforcer = Agent(name=&quot;style_enforcer&quot;, instructions=&quot;Use APA style guide from ...&quot;, server_names=[&quot;fetch&quot;])

orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    llm_factory=AnthropicAugmentedLLM,
    available_agents=[finder_agent, writer_agent, proofreader, fact_checker, style_enforcer],
)

task = &quot;Load short_story.md, evaluate it, produce a graded_report.md with multiple feedback aspects.&quot;
result = await orchestrator.generate_str(task, RequestParams(model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;))
print(result)
```

&lt;/details&gt;

### [Swarm](src/mcp_agent/workflows/swarm/swarm.py)

OpenAI has an experimental multi-agent pattern called [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm), which we provide a model-agnostic reference implementation for in mcp-agent.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/openai/swarm/blob/main/assets/swarm_diagram.png?raw=true&quot; width=500 /&gt;

The mcp-agent Swarm pattern works seamlessly with MCP servers, and is exposed as an `AugmentedLLM`, allowing for composability with other patterns above

**Qiskit**  is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.

This library is the core component of Qiskit, which contains the building blocks for creating and working with quantum circuits, quantum operators, and primitive functions (Sampler and Estimator).
It also contains a transpiler that supports optimizing quantum circuits, and a quantum information toolbox for creating advanced operators.

For more details on how to use Qiskit, refer to the documentation located here:

&lt;https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/&gt;


## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit via ``pip``:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

Pip will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/install-qiskit-source).

## Create your first quantum program in Qiskit

Now that Qiskit is installed, it&#039;s time to begin working with Qiskit. The essential parts of a quantum program are:
1. Define and build a quantum circuit that represents the quantum state
2. Define the classical output by measurements or a set of observable operators
3. Depending on the output, use the Sampler primitive to sample outcomes or the Estimator primitive to estimate expectation values.

Create an example quantum circuit using the `QuantumCircuit` class:

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# 1. A quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state |000&gt; + i |111&gt; / ‚àö2
qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
qc.h(0)             # generate superposition
qc.p(np.pi / 2, 0)  # add quantum phase
qc.cx(0, 1)         # 0th-qubit-Controlled-NOT gate on 1st qubit
qc.cx(0, 2)         # 0th-qubit-Controlled-NOT gate on 2nd qubit
```

This simple example creates an entangled state known as a [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) $(|000\rangle + i|111\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. It uses the standard quantum gates: Hadamard gate (`h`), Phase gate (`p`), and CNOT gate (`cx`). 

Once you&#039;ve made your first quantum circuit, choose which primitive you will use. Starting with the Sampler,
we use `measure_all(inplace=False)` to get a copy of the circuit in which all the qubits are measured:

```python
# 2. Add the classical output in the form of measurement of all qubits
qc_measured = qc.measure_all(inplace=False)

# 3. Execute using the Sampler primitive
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorSampler
sampler = StatevectorSampler()
job = sampler.run([qc_measured], shots=1000)
result = job.result()
print(f&quot; &gt; Counts: {result[0].data[&#039;meas&#039;].get_counts()}&quot;)
```
Running this will give an outcome similar to `{&#039;000&#039;: 497, &#039;111&#039;: 503}` which is `000` 50% of the time and `111` 50% of the time up to statistical fluctuations.
To illustrate the power of the Estimator, we now use the quantum information toolbox to create the operator $XXY+XYX+YXX-YYY$ and pass it to the `run()` function, along with our quantum circuit. Note that the Estimator requires a circuit _**without**_ measurements, so we use the `qc` circuit we created earlier.

```python
# 2. Define the observable to be measured 
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
operator = SparsePauliOp.from_list([(&quot;XXY&quot;, 1), (&quot;XYX&quot;, 1), (&quot;YXX&quot;, 1), (&quot;YYY&quot;, -1)])

# 3. Execute using the Estimator primitive
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorEstimator
estimator = StatevectorEstimator()
job = estimator.run([(qc, operator)], precision=1e-3)
result = job.result()
print(f&quot; &gt; Expectation values: {result[0].data.evs}&quot;)
```

Running this will give the outcome `4`. For fun, try to assign a value of +/- 1 to each single-qubit operator X and Y 
and see if you can achieve this outcome. (Spoiler alert: this is not possible!)

Using the Qiskit-provided `qiskit.primitives.StatevectorSampler` and `qiskit.primitives.StatevectorEstimator` will not take you very far.
The power of quantum computing cannot be simulated on classical computers and you need to use real quantum hardware to scale to larger quantum circuits.
However, running a quantum circuit on hardware requires rewriting to the basis gates and connectivity of the quantum hardware.
The tool that does this is the [transpiler](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler), and Qiskit includes transpiler passes for synthesis, optimization, mapping, and scheduling.
However, it also includes a default compiler, which works very well in most examples.
The following code will map the example circuit to the `basis_gates = [&quot;cz&quot;, &quot;sx&quot;, &quot;rz&quot;]` and a linear chain of qubits $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$ with the `coupling_map = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]`.

```python
from qiskit import transpile
qc_transpiled = transpile(qc, basis_gates=[&quot;cz&quot;, &quot;sx&quot;, &quot;rz&quot;], coupling_map=[[0, 1], [1, 2]], optimization_level=3)
```

### Executing your code on real quantum hardware

Qiskit provides an abstraction layer that lets users run quantum circuits on hardware from any vendor that provides a compatible interface. 
The best way to use Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides optimized implementations of Sampler and Estimator for a given hardware platform. This runtime may involve using pre- and post-processing, such as optimized transpiler passes with error suppression, error mitigation, and, eventually, error correction built in. A runtime implements `qiskit.primitives.BaseSamplerV2` and `qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimatorV2` interfaces. For example,
some packages that provide implementations of a runtime primitive implementation are:

* https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime

Qiskit also provides a lower-level abstract interface for describing quantum backends. This interface, located in
``qiskit.providers``, defines an abstract `BackendV2` class that providers can implement to represent their
hardware or simulators to Qiskit. The backend class includes a common interface for executing circuits on the backends; however, in this interface each provider may perform different types of pre- and post-processing and return outcomes that are vendor-defined. Some examples of published provider packages that interface with real hardware are:

* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-ionq
* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-aqt-provider
* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider
* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-quantinuum-provider
* https://github.com/rigetti/qiskit-rigetti

&lt;!-- This is not an exhaustive list, and if you maintain a provider package please feel free to open a PR to add new providers --&gt;

You can refer to the documentation of these packages for further instructions
on how to get access and use these systems.

# AutoGen

**AutoGen** is a framework for creating multi-agent AI applications that can act autonomously or work alongside humans.

## Installation

AutoGen requires **Python 3.10 or later**.

```bash
# Install AgentChat and OpenAI client from Extensions
pip install -U &quot;autogen-agentchat&quot; &quot;autogen-ext[openai]&quot;
```

The current stable version is v0.4. If you are upgrading from AutoGen v0.2, please refer to the [Migration Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/migration-guide.html) for detailed instructions on how to update your code and configurations.

```bash
# Install AutoGen Studio for no-code GUI
pip install -U &quot;autogenstudio&quot;
```

## Quickstart

### Hello World

Create an assistant agent using OpenAI&#039;s GPT-4o model. See [other supported models](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/tutorial/models.html).

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

async def main() -&gt; None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;)
    agent = AssistantAgent(&quot;assistant&quot;, model_client=model_client)
    print(await agent.run(task=&quot;Say &#039;Hello World!&#039;&quot;))
    await model_client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Web Browsing Agent Team

Create a group chat team with a web surfer agent and a user proxy agent
for web browsing tasks. You need to install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library).

```python
# pip install -U autogen-agentchat autogen-ext[openai,web-surfer]
# playwright install
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import UserProxyAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient
from autogen_ext.agents.web_surfer import MultimodalWebSurfer

async def main() -&gt; None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=&quot;gpt-4o&quot;)
    # The web surfer will open a Chromium browser window to perform web browsing tasks.
    web_surfer = MultimodalWebSurfer(&quot;web_surfer&quot;, model_client, headless=False, animate_actions=True)
    # The user proxy agent is used to get user input after each step of the web surfer.
    # NOTE: you can skip input by pressing Enter.
    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(&quot;user_proxy&quot;)
    # The termination condition is set to end the conversation when the user types &#039;exit&#039;.
    termination = TextMentionTermination(&quot;exit&quot;, sources=[&quot;user_proxy&quot;])
    # Web surfer and user proxy take turns in a round-robin fashion.
    team = RoundRobinGroupChat([web_surfer, user_proxy], termination_condition=termination)
    try:
        # Start the team and wait for it to terminate.
        await Console(team.run_stream(task=&quot;Find information about AutoGen and write a short summary.&quot;))
    finally:
        await web_surfer.close()
        await model_client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### AutoGen Studio

Use AutoGen Studio to prototype and run multi-agent workflows without writing code.

```bash
# Run AutoGen Studio on http://localhost:8080
autogenstudio ui --port 8080 --appdir ./my-app
```

## Why Use AutoGen?

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;autogen-landing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AutoGen Landing&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The AutoGen ecosystem provides everything you need to create AI agents, especially multi-agent workflows -- framework, developer tools, and applications.

The _framework_ uses a layered and extensible design. Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.

- [Core API](./python/packages/autogen-core/) implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.
- [AgentChat API](./python/packages/autogen-agentchat/) implements a simpler but opinionated¬†API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.
- [Extensions API](./python/packages/autogen-ext/) enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.

The ecosystem also supports two essential _developer tools_:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/microsoft/autogen/refs/heads/main/python/packages/autogen-studio/docs/ags_screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;AutoGen Studio Screenshot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- [AutoGen Studio](./python/packages/autogen-studio/) provides a no-code GUI for building multi-agent applications.
- [AutoGen Bench](./python/packages/agbench/) provides a benchmarking suite for evaluating agent performance.

You can use the AutoGen framework and developer tools to create applications for your domain. For example, [Magentic-One](./python/packages/magentic-one-cli/) is a state-of-the-art multi-agent team built using AgentChat API and Extensions API that can handle a variety of tasks that require web browsing, code execution, and file handling.

With AutoGen you get to join and contribute to a thriving ecosystem. We host weekly office hours and talks with maintainers and community. We also have a [Discord server](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord) for real-time chat, GitHub Discussions for Q&amp;A, and a blog for tutorials and updates.

## Try it now

Try the Claude Sonnet powered PR-Agent instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@CodiumAI-Agent` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The agent will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:

```
@CodiumAI-Agent /review
```

and the agent will respond with a review of your PR.

Note that this is a promotional bot, suitable only for initial experimentation.
It does not have &#039;edit&#039; access to your repo, for example, so it cannot update the PR description or add labels (`@CodiumAI-Agent /describe` will publish PR description as a comment). In addition, the bot cannot be used on private repositories, as it does not have access to the files there.

## Qodo Merge üíé

[Qodo Merge](https://www.qodo.ai/pricing/) is a hosted version of PR-Agent, provided by Qodo. It is available for a monthly fee, and provides the following benefits:

1. **Fully managed** - We take care of everything for you - hosting, models, regular updates, and more. Installation is as simple as signing up and adding the Qodo Merge app to your GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repo.
2. **Improved privacy** - No data will be stored or used to train models. Qodo Merge will employ zero data retention, and will use an OpenAI account with zero data retention.
3. **Improved support** - Qodo Merge users will receive priority support, and will be able to request new features and capabilities.
4. **Extra features** - In addition to the benefits listed above, Qodo Merge will emphasize more customization, and the usage of static code analysis, in addition to LLM logic, to improve results.
See [here](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/overview/pr_agent_pro/) for a list of features available in Qodo Merge.

## How it works

The following diagram illustrates PR-Agent tools and their flow:

![PR-Agent Tools](https://www.qodo.ai/images/pr_agent/diagram-v0.9.png)

Check out the [PR Compression strategy](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) page for more details on how we convert a code diff to a manageable LLM prompt

## Why use PR-Agent?

A reasonable question that can be asked is: `&quot;Why use PR-Agent? What makes it stand out from existing tools?&quot;`

Here are some advantages of PR-Agent:

- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single LLM call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.
- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.
- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the &#039;/review&#039; tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.
- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Action, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT, Claude, Deepseek, ...)

## Data privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Agent

- If you host PR-Agent with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

### Qodo-hosted Qodo Merge üíé

- When using Qodo Merge üíé, hosted by Qodo, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, Qodo-hosted Qodo Merge will use Qodo‚Äôs proprietary models ‚Äî if this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests‚Äô data ‚Äî Qodo Merge will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

### Qodo Merge Chrome extension

- The [Qodo Merge Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/qodo-merge-ai-powered-cod/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user&#039;s repo or pull request code.

# Ansible

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles
configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,
ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex
changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible [website](https://ansible.com/).

## Design Principles

* Have an extremely simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.
* Manage machines quickly and in parallel.
* Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
  leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
* Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
  friendly.
* Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
* Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
  software.
* Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
* Be usable as non-root.
* Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.

## Use Ansible

You can install a released version of Ansible with `pip` or a package manager. See our
[installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for details on installing Ansible
on a variety of platforms.

Power users and developers can run the `devel` branch, which has the latest
features and fixes, directly. Although it is reasonably stable, you are more likely to encounter
breaking changes when running the `devel` branch. We recommend getting involved
in the Ansible community if you want to run the `devel` branch.

## Communication

Join the Ansible forum to ask questions, get help, and interact with the
community.

* [Get Help](https://forum.ansible.com/c/help/6): Find help or share your Ansible knowledge to help others.
  Use tags to filter and subscribe to posts, such as the following:
  * Posts tagged with [ansible](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/ansible)
  * Posts tagged with [ansible-core](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/ansible-core)
  * Posts tagged with [playbook](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/playbook)
* [Social Spaces](https://forum.ansible.com/c/chat/4): Meet and interact with fellow enthusiasts.
* [News &amp; Announcements](https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/5): Track project-wide announcements including social events.
* [Bullhorn newsletter](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#the-bullhorn): Get release announcements and important changes.

## Contribute to Ansible

* Check out the [Contributor&#039;s Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Read [Community Information](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community) for all
  kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project,
  including how to submit bug reports and code to Ansible.
* Submit a proposed code update through a pull request to the `devel` branch.
* Talk to us before making larger changes
  to avoid duplicate efforts. This not only helps everyone
  know what is going on, but it also helps save time and effort if we decide
  some changes are needed.

## Coding Guidelines

We document our Coding Guidelines in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/). We particularly suggest you review:

* [Contributing your module to Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.html)
* [Conventions, tips, and pitfalls](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.html)

## Branch Info

* The `devel` branch corresponds to the release actively under development.
* The `stable-2.X` branches correspond to stable releases.
* Create a branch based on `devel` and set up a [dev environment](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html#common-environment-setup) if you want to open a PR.
* See the [Ansible release and maintenance](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) page for information about active branches.

&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; #### FastMCP 2.0 &amp; The Official MCP SDK
&gt;
&gt; FastMCP is the standard framework for building MCP servers and clients. FastMCP 1.0 was incorporated into the [official MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).
&gt;
&gt; **This is FastMCP 2.0,** the actively maintained version that significantly expands on 1.0&#039;s basic server-building capabilities by introducing full client support, server composition, OpenAPI/FastAPI integration, remote server proxying, built-in testing tools, and more.
&gt;
&gt; FastMCP 2.0 is the complete toolkit for modern AI applications. Ready to upgrade or get started? Follow the [installation instructions](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation), which include specific steps for upgrading from the official MCP SDK.

---

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a new, standardized way to provide context and tools to your LLMs, and FastMCP makes building MCP servers and clients simple and intuitive. Create tools, expose resources, define prompts, and connect components with clean, Pythonic code.

```python
# server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(&quot;Demo üöÄ&quot;)

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Add two numbers&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return a + b

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    mcp.run()
```

Run the server locally:
```bash
fastmcp run server.py
```

### üìö Documentation

FastMCP&#039;s complete documentation is available at **[gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com)**, including detailed guides, API references, and advanced patterns. This readme provides only a high-level overview.

Documentation is also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/), which is a simple markdown standard that LLMs can consume easily. 

There are two ways to access the LLM-friendly documentation:
- [`llms.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) is essentially a sitemap, listing all the pages in the documentation.
- [`llms-full.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) contains the entire documentation. Note this may exceed the context window of your LLM.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (similar to `GET` requests; load info into context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (similar to `POST`/`PUT` requests; execute actions)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates)
- And more!

FastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building and interacting with these servers.

## Why FastMCP?

The MCP protocol is powerful but implementing it involves a lot of boilerplate - server setup, protocol handlers, content types, error management. FastMCP handles all the complex protocol details and server management, so you can focus on building great tools. It&#039;s designed to be high-level and Pythonic; in most cases, decorating a function is all you need.

While the core server concepts of FastMCP 1.0 laid the groundwork and were contributed to the official MCP SDK, **FastMCP 2.0 (this project) is the actively developed successor**, adding significant enhancements and entirely new capabilities like a powerful **client library**, server **proxying**, **composition** patterns, **OpenAPI/FastAPI integration**, and much more.

FastMCP aims to be:

üöÄ **Fast:** High-level interface means less code and faster development

üçÄ **Simple:** Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate

üêç **Pythonic:** Feels natural to Python developers

üîç **Complete:** FastMCP aims to provide a full implementation of the core MCP specification for both servers and clients

## Installation

We recommend installing FastMCP with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv pip install fastmcp
```

For full installation instructions, including verification, upgrading from the official MCPSDK, and developer setup, see the [**Installation Guide**](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation).

## Core Concepts

These are the building blocks for creating MCP servers and clients with FastMCP.

### The `FastMCP` Server

The central object representing your MCP application. It holds your tools, resources, and prompts, manages connections, and can be configured with settings like [authentication providers](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/fastmcp#authentication).

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a server instance
mcp = FastMCP(name=&quot;MyAssistantServer&quot;)
```

Learn more in the [**FastMCP Server Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/fastmcp).

### Tools

Tools allow LLMs to perform actions by executing your Python functions (sync or async). Ideal for computations, API calls, or side effects (like `POST`/`PUT`). FastMCP handles schema generation from type hints and docstrings. Tools can return various types, including text, JSON-serializable objects, and even images using the [`fastmcp.Image`](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools#return-values) helper.

```python
@mcp.tool()
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -&gt; float:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Multiplies two numbers.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return a * b
```

Learn more in the [**Tools Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools).

### Resources &amp; Templates

Resources expose read-only data sources (like `GET` requests). Use `@mcp.resource(&quot;your://uri&quot;)`. Use `{placeholders}` in the URI to create dynamic templates that accept parameters, allowing clients to request specific data subsets.

```python
# Static resource
@mcp.resource(&quot;config://version&quot;)
def get_version(): 
    return &quot;2.0.1&quot;

# Dynamic resource template
@mcp.resource(&quot;users://{user_id}/profile&quot;)
def get_profile(user_id: int):
    # Fetch profile for user_id...
    return {&quot;name&quot;: f&quot;User {user_id}&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;active&quot;}
```

Learn more in the [**Resources &amp; Templates Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources).

### Prompts

Prompts define reusable message templates to guide LLM interactions. Decorate functions with `@mcp.prompt()`. Return strings or `Message` objects.

```python
@mcp.prompt()
def summarize_request(text: str) -&gt; str:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Generate a prompt asking for a summary.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return f&quot;Please summarize the following text:\n\n{text}&quot;
```

Learn more in the [**Prompts Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts).

### Context

Access MCP session capabilities within your tools, resources, or prompts by adding a `ctx: Context` parameter. Context provides methods for:
*   **Logging:** Log messages to MCP clients with `ctx.info()`, `ctx.error()`, etc.
*   **LLM Sampling:** Use `ctx.sample()` to request completions from the client&#039;s LLM.
*   **HTTP Request:** Use `ctx.http_request()` to make HTTP requests to other servers.
*   **Resource Access:** Use `ctx.read_resource()` to access resources on the server
*   **Progress Reporting:** Use `ctx.report_progress()` to report progress to the client.
*   and more...

To access the context, add a parameter annotated as `Context` to any mcp-decorated function. FastMCP will automatically inject the correct context object when the function is called.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(&quot;My MCP Server&quot;)

@mcp.tool()
async def process_data(uri: str, ctx: Context):
    # Log a message to the client
    await ctx.info(f&quot;Processing {uri}...&quot;)

    # Read a resource from the server
    data = await ctx.read_resource(uri)

    # Ask client LLM to summarize the data
    summary = await ctx.sample(f&quot;Summarize: {data.content[:500]}&quot;)

    # Return the summary
    return summary.text
```

Learn more in the [**Context Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context).

### MCP Clients

Interact with *any* MCP server programmatically using the `fastmcp.Client`. It supports various transports (Stdio, SSE, In-Memory) and often auto-detects the correct one. The client can also handle advanced patterns like server-initiated **LLM sampling requests** if you provide an appropriate handler.

Critically, the client allows for efficient **in-memory testing** of your servers by connecting directly to a `FastMCP` server instance via the `FastMCPTransport`, eliminating the need for process management or network calls during tests.

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async def main():
    # Connect via stdio to a local script
    async with Client(&quot;my_server.py&quot;) as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print(f&quot;Available tools: {tools}&quot;)
        result = await client.call_tool(&quot;add&quot;, {&quot;a&quot;: 5, &quot;b&quot;: 3})
        print(f&quot;Result: {result.text}&quot;)

    # Connect via SSE
    async with Client(&quot;http://localhost:8000/sse&quot;) as client:
        # ... use the client
        pass
```

To use clients to test servers, use the following pattern:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

mcp = FastMCP(&quot;My MCP Server&quot;)

async def main():
    # Connect via in-memory transport
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        # ... use the client
```

FastMCP also supports connecting to multiple servers through a single unified client using the standard MCP configuration format:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

# Standard MCP configuration with multiple servers
config = {
    &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
        &quot;weather&quot;: {&quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://weather-api.example.com/mcp&quot;},
        &quot;assistant&quot;: {&quot;command&quot;: &quot;python&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;./assistant_server.py&quot;]}
    }
}

# Create a client that connects to all servers
client = Client(config)

async def main():
    async with client:
        # Access tools and resources with server prefixes
        forecast = await client.call_tool(&quot;weather_get_forecast&quot;, {&quot;city&quot;: &quot;London&quot;})
        answer = await client.call_tool(&quot;assistant_answer_question&quot;, {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;What is MCP?&quot;})
```

Learn more in the [**Client Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client) and [**Transports Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/transports).

## Advanced Features

FastMCP introduces powerful ways to structure and deploy your MCP applications.

### Proxy Servers

Create a FastMCP server that acts as an intermediary for another local or remote MCP server using `FastMCP.as_proxy()`. This is especially useful for bridging transports (e.g., remote SSE to local Stdio) or adding a layer of logic to a server you don&#039;t control.

Learn more in the [**Proxying Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/proxy).

### Composing MCP Servers

Build modular applications by mounting multiple `FastMCP` instances onto a parent server using `mcp.mount()` (live link) or `mcp.import_server()` (static copy).

Learn more in the [**Composition Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/composition).

### OpenAPI &amp; FastAPI Generation

Automatically generate FastMCP servers from existing OpenAPI specifications (`FastMCP.from_openapi()`) or FastAPI applications (`FastMCP.from_fastapi()`), instantly bringing your web APIs to the MCP ecosystem.

Learn more: [**OpenAPI Integration**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/openapi) | [**FastAPI Integration**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/fastapi).

## Running Your Server

The main way to run a FastMCP server is by calling the `run()` method on your server instance:

```python
# server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(&quot;Demo üöÄ&quot;)

@mcp.tool()
def hello(name: str) -&gt; str:
    return f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    mcp.run()  # Default: uses STDIO transport
```

FastMCP supports three transport protocols:

**STDIO (Default)**: Best for local tools and command-line scripts.
```python
mcp.run(transport=&quot;stdio&quot;)  # Default, so transport argument is optional
```

**Streamable HTTP**: Recommended for web deployments.
```python
mcp.run(transport=&quot;streamable-http&quot;, host=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, port=8000, path=&quot;/mcp&quot;)
```

**SSE**: For compatibility with existing SSE clients.
```python
mcp.run(transport=&quot;sse&quot;, host=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, port=8000)
```

See the [**Running Server Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/running-server) for more details.

# üëã Hello

I build open source AI apps. To finance my work i also build paid versions of my code. But feel free to use the free code. I post features and new projects on https://twitter.com/philz1337x

# üîé Upscaling with Flux

Flux Upscaling is now available at [ClarityAI.co/flux-upscaler](http://clarityai.co/flux-upscaler) and is not open-source

- It supports Flux LoRas with a style or a face
- It&#039;s very good at faces, text, art, and generating error-free images

# üöÄ Options to use Clarity-Upscaler

Note that this repository is an implementation for cog. If you are not familiar with cog, I recommend the easier solutions. The free options are ComfyUI and A1111, while the paid but easy-to-use options are my app ClarityAI.co and the ComfyUI API Node.

## üßë‚Äçüíª App

The simplest option to use Clarity is with the app at [ClarityAI.co](https://ClarityAI.co)

## ‚öôÔ∏è API

To integrate Clarity Upscaler with an API into your application use: [ClarityAI.co/API](https://ClarityAI.co/api)

## üê∞ ComfyUI

### 1. API node

1. Open ComfyUI Manager, search for Clarity AI, and install the node.
2. Create an API key at: [ClarityAI.co/ComfyUI](https://ClarityAI.co/comfyui)
3. Add the API key to the node as a) envirement variable `CAI_API_KEY` OR b) to a `cai_platform_key.txt` text file OR c) in `api_key_override` field of the node.

Full instructions: https://github.com/philz1337x/ComfyUI-ClarityAI

### 2. Free workflow

1. Download the repo https://github.com/philz1337x/ComfyUI-ClarityAI and use the file free-wokflow.json

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cog

If you are not familiar with cog read: &lt;a href=https://github.com/replicate/cog/blob/main/docs/getting-started-own-model.md&gt;cog docs&lt;/a&gt;

- run `download_weights.py`

- predict with cog:

```su
cog predict -i image=&quot;link-to-image&quot;
```

## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è A1111 webUI

For a detailed explanation, use the tutorial in this post: https://x.com/philz1337x/status/1830504764389380466

https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
