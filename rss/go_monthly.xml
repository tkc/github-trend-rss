# Overview

**Eino[&#039;aino]** (pronounced similarly to &quot;I know&quot;) aims to be the ultimate LLM application development framework in Golang. Drawing inspirations from many excellent LLM application development frameworks in the open-source community such as LangChain &amp; LlamaIndex, etc., as well as learning from cutting-edge research and real world applications, Eino offers an LLM application development framework that emphasizes on simplicity, scalability, reliability and effectiveness that better aligns with Golang programming conventions.

What Eino provides are:
- a carefully curated list of **component** abstractions and implementations that can be easily reused and combined to build LLM applications
- a powerful **composition** framework that does the heavy lifting of strong type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection, option assignment, etc. for the user.
- a set of meticulously designed **API** that obsesses on simplicity and clarity.
- an ever-growing collection of best practices in the form of bundled **flows** and **examples**.
- a useful set of tools that covers the entire development cycle, from visualized development and debugging to online tracing and evaluation.

With the above arsenal, Eino can standardize, simplify, and improve efficiency at different stages of the AI application development cycle:
![](.github/static/img/eino/eino_concept.jpeg)

# A quick walkthrough

Use a component directly:
```Go
model, _ := openai.NewChatModel(ctx, config) // create an invokable LLM instance
message, _ := model.Generate(ctx, []*Message{
    SystemMessage(&quot;you are a helpful assistant.&quot;),
    UserMessage(&quot;what does the future AI App look like?&quot;)})
```

Of course, you can do that, Eino provides lots of useful components to use out of the box. But you can do more by using orchestration, for three reasons:
- orchestration encapsulates common patterns of LLM application.
- orchestration solves the difficult problem of processing stream response by the LLM.
- orchestration handles type safety, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment for you.

Eino provides two set of APIs for orchestration

| API      | Characteristics and usage                                             |
| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain    | Simple chained directed graph that can only go forward.               |
| Graph    | Cyclic or Acyclic directed graph. Powerful and flexible.              |

Let&#039;s create a simple chain: a ChatTemplate followed by a ChatModel.

![](.github/static/img/eino/simple_chain.png)

```Go
chain, _ := NewChain[map[string]any, *Message]().
           AppendChatTemplate(prompt).
           AppendChatModel(model).
           Compile(ctx)

chain.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;what&#039;s your name?&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a graph that uses a ChatModel to generate answer or tool calls, then uses a ToolsNode to execute those tools if needed.

![](.github/static/img/eino/tool_call_graph.png)

```Go
graph := NewGraph[map[string]any, *schema.Message]()

_ = graph.AddChatTemplateNode(&quot;node_template&quot;, chatTpl)
_ = graph.AddChatModelNode(&quot;node_model&quot;, chatModel)
_ = graph.AddToolsNode(&quot;node_tools&quot;, toolsNode)
_ = graph.AddLambdaNode(&quot;node_converter&quot;, takeOne)

_ = graph.AddEdge(START, &quot;node_template&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_template&quot;, &quot;node_model&quot;)
_ = graph.AddBranch(&quot;node_model&quot;, branch)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_tools&quot;, &quot;node_converter&quot;)
_ = graph.AddEdge(&quot;node_converter&quot;, END)

compiledGraph, err := graph.Compile(ctx)
if err != nil {
return err
}
out, err := r.Invoke(ctx, map[string]any{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;Beijing&#039;s weather this weekend&quot;})
```

Now let&#039;s create a &#039;ReAct&#039; agent: A ChatModel binds to Tools. It receives input Messages and decides independently whether to call the Tool or output the final result. The execution result of the Tool will again become the input Message for the ChatModel and serve as the context for the next round of independent judgment.

![](.github/static/img/eino/react.png)

We provide a complete implementation for ReAct Agent out of the box in the `flow` package. Check out the code here: [flow/agent/react](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino/blob/main/flow/agent/react/react.go)

Our implementation of ReAct Agent uses Eino&#039;s **graph orchestration** exclusively, which provides the following benefits out of the box:
- Type checking: it makes sure the two nodes&#039; input and output types match at compile time.
- Stream processing: concatenates message stream before passing to chatModel and toolsNode if needed, and copies the stream into callback handlers.
- Concurrency management: the shared state can be safely read and written because the StatePreHandler is concurrency safe.
- Aspect injection: injects callback aspects before and after the execution of ChatModel if the specified ChatModel implementation hasn&#039;t injected itself.
- Option assignment: call options are assigned either globally, to specific component type or to specific node.

For example, you could easily extend the compiled graph with callbacks:
```Go
handler := NewHandlerBuilder().
  OnStartFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, input CallbackInput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onStart, runInfo: %v, input: %v&quot;, info, input)
    }).
  OnEndFn(
    func(ctx context.Context, info *RunInfo, output CallbackOutput) context.Context) {
        log.Infof(&quot;onEnd, runInfo: %v, out: %v&quot;, info, output)
    }).
  Build()
  
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))
```

or you could easily assign options to different nodes:
```Go
// assign to All nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler))

// assign only to ChatModel nodes
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithChatModelOption(WithTemperature(0.5))

// assign only to node_1
compiledGraph.Invoke(ctx, input, WithCallbacks(handler).DesignateNode(&quot;node_1&quot;))
```

# Key Features

## Rich Components

- Encapsulates common building blocks into **component abstractions**, each have multiple **component implementations** that are ready to be used out of the box.
    - component abstractions such as ChatModel, Tool, ChatTemplate, Retriever, Document Loader, Lambda, etc.
    - each component type has an interface of its own: defined Input &amp; Output Type, defined Option type, and streaming paradigms that make sense.
    - implementations are transparent. Abstractions are all you care about when orchestrating components together.

- Implementations can be nested and captures complex business logic.
    - ReAct Agent, MultiQueryRetriever, Host MultiAgent, etc. They consist of multiple components and non-trivial business logic.
    - They are still transparent from the outside. A MultiQueryRetriever can be used anywhere that accepts a Retriever.

## Powerful Orchestration

- Data flows from Retriever / Document Loaders / ChatTemplate to ChatModel, then flows to Tools and parsed as Final Answer. This directed, controlled flow of data through multiple components can be implemented through **graph orchestration**.
- Component instances are graph nodes, and edges are data flow channels.
- Graph orchestration is powerful and flexible enough to implement complex business logic:
  - type checking, stream processing, concurrency management, aspect injection and option assignment are handled by the framework.
  - branch out execution at runtime, read and write global state, or do field level data mapping using workflow(currently in alpha stage).


## Complete Stream Processing

- Stream processing is important because ChatModel outputs chunks of messages in real time as it generates them. It&#039;s especially important with orchestration because more components need to handle streaming data.
- Eino automatically **concatenates** stream chunks for downstream nodes that only accepts non-stream input, such as ToolsNode.
- Eino automatically **boxes** non stream into stream when stream is needed during graph execution.  
- Eino automatically **merges** multiple streams as they converge into a single downward node.
- Eino automatically **copies** stream as they fan out to different downward node, or is passed to callback handlers.
- Orchestration elements such as **branch** and **state handlers** are also stream aware.
- With these streaming processing abilities, the streaming paradigms of components themselves become transparent to the user. 
- A compiled Graph can run with 4 different streaming paradigms:

| Streaming Paradigm | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoke             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns non-stream type O                     |
| Stream             | Accepts non-stream type I and returns stream type StreamReader[O]           |
| Collect            | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns non-stream type O           |
| Transform          | Accepts stream type StreamReader[I] and returns stream type StreamReader[O] |

## Highly Extensible Aspects (Callbacks)

- Aspects handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, tracing, metrics, etc., as well as exposing internal details of component implementations.
- Five aspects are supported: **OnStart, OnEnd, OnError, OnStartWithStreamInput, OnEndWithStreamOutput**.
- Developers can easily create custom callback handlers, add them during graph run via options, and they will be invoked during graph run.
- Graph can also inject aspects to those component implementations that do not support callbacks on their own.

## What is Milvus?

🐦 [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) is a high-performance vector database built for scale. It powers AI applications by efficiently organizing and searching vast amounts of unstructured data, such as text, images, and multi-modal information.

🧑‍💻 Written in Go and C++, Milvus implements hardware accelaration for CPU/GPU to achieve best-in-class vector search performance. Thanks to its [fully-distributed and K8s-native architecture](https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md#What-Makes-Milvus-so-Scalable), Milvus can scale horizontally, handle tens of thousands of search queries on billions of vectors, and keep data fresh with real-time streaming updates. Milvus also supports [Standalone mode](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) for single machine deployment. [Milvus Lite](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus_lite.md) is a lightweight version good for quickstart in python with `pip install`.

## Quickstart

```python
$ pip install -U pymilvus
```
This installs `pymilvus`, the Python SDK for Milvus. Use `MilvusClient` to create a client:
```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient
```

* `pymilvus` also includes Milvus Lite for quickstart. To create a local vector database, simply instantiate a client with a local file name for persisting data:

  ```python
  client = MilvusClient(&quot;milvus_demo.db&quot;)
  ```

* You can also specify the credentials to connect to your deployed [Milvus server](https://milvus.io/docs/authenticate.md?tab=docker) or [Zilliz Cloud](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/quick-start):

  ```python
  client = MilvusClient(
    uri=&quot;&lt;endpoint_of_self_hosted_milvus_or_zilliz_cloud&gt;&quot;,
    token=&quot;&lt;username_and_password_or_zilliz_cloud_api_key&gt;&quot;)
  ```

With the client, you can create collection:
```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name=&quot;demo_collection&quot;,
    dimension=768,  # The vectors we will use in this demo has 768 dimensions
)
```

Ingest data:
```python
res = client.insert(collection_name=&quot;demo_collection&quot;, data=data)
```

Perform vector search:

```python
query_vectors = embedding_fn.encode_queries([&quot;Who is Alan Turing?&quot;, &quot;What is AI?&quot;])
res = client.search(
    collection_name=&quot;demo_collection&quot;,  # target collection
    data=query_vectors,  # a list of one or more query vectors, supports batch
    limit=2,  # how many results to return (topK)
    output_fields=[&quot;vector&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;subject&quot;],  # what fields to return
)
```

## Why Milvus

Milvus is designed to handle vector search at scale. It stores vectors, which are learned representations of unstructured data, together with other scalar data types such as integers, strings, and JSON objects. Users can conduct efficient vector search with metadata filtering or hybrid search. Here are why developers choose Milvus as the vector database for AI applications:

**High Performance at Scale and High Availability**  
  * Milvus features a [distributed architecture](https://milvus.io/docs/architecture_overview.md ) that separates [compute](https://milvus.io/docs/data_processing.md#Data-query) and [storage](https://milvus.io/docs/data_processing.md#Data-insertion). Milvus can horizontally scale and adapt to diverse traffic patterns, achieving optimal performance by independently increasing query nodes for read-heavy workload and data node for write-heavy workload. The stateless microservices on K8s allow [quick recovery](https://milvus.io/docs/coordinator_ha.md#Coordinator-HA) from failure, ensuring high availability. The support for [replicas](https://milvus.io/docs/replica.md) further enhances fault tolerance and throughput by loading data segments on multiple query nodes. See [benchmark](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-benchmark-tool) for performance comparison.


**Support for Various Vector Index Types and Hardware Acceleration**  
  * Milvus separates the system and core vector search engine, allowing it to support all major vector index types that are optimized for different scenarios, including HNSW, IVF, FLAT (brute-force), SCANN, and DiskANN, with [quantization-based](https://milvus.io/docs/index.md?tab=floating#IVFPQ) variations and [mmap](https://milvus.io/docs/mmap.md). Milvus optimizes vector search for advanced features such as [metadata filtering](https://milvus.io/docs/scalar_index.md#Scalar-Index) and [range search](https://milvus.io/docs/single-vector-search.md#Range-search). Additionally, Milvus implements hardware acceleration to enhance vector search performance and supports GPU indexing, such as NVIDIA&#039;s [CAGRA](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs).


**Flexible Multi-tenancy and Hot/Cold Storage**
  * Milvus supports [multi-tenancy](https://milvus.io/docs/multi_tenancy.md#Multi-tenancy-strategies) through isolation at database, collection, partition, or partition key level. The flexible strategies allow a single cluster to handle hundreds to millions of tenants, also ensures optimized search performance and flexible access control. Milvus enhances cost-effectiveness with hot/cold storage. Frequently accessed hot data can be stored in memory or on SSDs for better performance, while less-accessed cold data is kept on slower, cost-effective storage. This mechanism can significantly reduce costs while maintaining high performance for critical tasks.

**Sparse Vector for Full Text Search and Hybrid Search**
  * In addition to semantic search through dense vector, Milvus also natively supports [full text search](https://milvus.io/docs/full-text-search.md) with BM25 as well as learned sparse embedding such as SPLADE and BGE-M3. Users can store sparse vector and dense vector in the same collection, and define functions to rerank results from multiple search requests. See examples of [Hybrid Search with semantic search + full text search](https://milvus.io/docs/full_text_search_with_milvus.md).

**Data Security and Fine-grain Access Control**
  * Milvus ensures data security by implementing mandatory user authentication, TLS encryption, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). User authentication ensures that only authorized users with valid credentials can access the database, while TLS encryption secures all communications within the network. Additionally, RBAC allows for fine-grained access control by assigning specific permissions to users based on their roles. These features make Milvus a robust and secure choice for enterprise applications, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

Milvus is trusted by AI developers to build applications such as text and image search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and recommendation systems. Milvus powers [many mission-critical business]((https://milvus.io/use-cases)) for startups and enterprises.

## Ecosystem and Integration
   Milvus integrates with a comprehensive suite of [AI development tools](https://milvus.io/docs/integrations_overview.md), such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI and HuggingFace, making it an ideal vector store for GenAI applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Milvus works with both open-source embedding models and embedding service, in text, image and video modalities. Milvus also provides a convenient util [`pymilvus[model]`](https://milvus.io/docs/embeddings.md), users can use the simple wrapper code to transform unstructured data into vector embeddings and leverage reranking models for optimized search results. The Milvus ecosystem also includes [Attu](https://github.com/zilliztech/attu?tab=readme-ov-file#attu) for GUI-based administration, [Birdwatcher](https://milvus.io/docs/birdwatcher_overview.md) for system debugging, [Prometheus/Grafana](https://milvus.io/docs/monitor_overview.md) for monitoring, [Milvus CDC](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus-cdc-overview.md) for data synchronization, [VTS](https://github.com/zilliztech/vts?tab=readme-ov-file#vts) for data migration and data connectors for [Spark](https://milvus.io/docs/integrate_with_spark.md#Spark-Milvus-Connector-User-Guide), [Kafka](https://github.com/zilliztech/kafka-connect-milvus?tab=readme-ov-file#kafka-connect-milvus-connector), [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/milvus), and [Airbyte](https://milvus.io/docs/integrate_with_airbyte.md) to build search pipelines.

evcc believes in open source software. We&#039;re committed to provide best in class EV charging experience.
Maintaining evcc consumes time and effort. With the vast amount of different devices to support, we depend on community and vendor support to keep evcc alive.

While evcc is open source, we would also like to encourage vendors to provide open source hardware devices, public documentation and support open source projects like ours that provide additional value to otherwise closed hardware. Where this is not the case, evcc requires &quot;sponsor token&quot; to finance ongoing development and support of evcc.

            <h2>README</h2><pre>## What is Dagger?

Dagger is an open-source runtime for composable workflows. It&#039;s perfect for systems with many moving parts and a strong need for **repeatability**, **modularity**, **observability** and **cross-platform support**. This makes it a great choice for AI agents and CI/CD workflows.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/static/img/dagger-factory.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

## Key Features

- **Containerized Workflow Execution:** Transform code into containerized, composable operations. Build reproducible workflows in any language with custom environments, parallel processing, and seamless chaining.

- **Universal Type System:** Mix and match components from any language with type-safe connections. Use the best tools from each ecosystem without translation headaches.

- **Automatic Artifact Caching:** Operations produce cacheable, immutable artifacts — even for LLMs and API calls. Your workflows run faster and cost less.

- **Built-in Observability:** Full visibility into operations with tracing, logs, and metrics. Debug complex workflows and know exactly what&#039;s happening.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/static/img/cloud-trace.gif&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

- **Open Platform:** Works with any compute platform and tech stack — today and tomorrow. Ship faster, experiment freely, and don’t get locked into someone else&#039;s choices.

- **LLM Augmentation:** Native integration of any LLM that automatically discovers and uses available functions in your workflow. Ship mind-blowing agents in just a few dozen lines of code.

- **Interactive Terminal:** Directly interact with your workflow or agents in real-time through your terminal. Prototype, test, debug, and ship even faster.

## About

The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler
[protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).
It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which
translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the
[`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotations in your service definitions.

This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.

&lt;/div&gt;

## Docs

You can read our docs at:

- https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

## Testimonials

&gt; We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day,
&gt; and have been since 2018 and through all of that,
&gt; we have never had any issues with it.
&gt;
&gt; _- William Mill, [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/)_

## Background

gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming
languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is
combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional
RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining
backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by
gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful
JSON architecture.

This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service.
A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all
that&#039;s needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.

## Installation

### Compile from source

The following instructions assume you are using
[Go Modules](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) for dependency
management. Use a
[tool dependency](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
to track the versions of the following executable packages:

```go
// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc&quot;
    _ &quot;google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go&quot;
)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to resolve the versions. Install by running

```sh
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This will place four binaries in your `$GOBIN`;

- `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`
- `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
- `protoc-gen-go`
- `protoc-gen-go-grpc`

Make sure that your `$GOBIN` is in your `$PATH`.

### **Using the `tool` Directive in Go 1.24**

Starting from Go 1.24, the `tool` directive in `go.mod` provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate `tools.go` file with blank imports.

#### **Tracking Tools in `go.mod`**

Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the `tool` directive in `go.mod` to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:

```go
module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
```

#### **Managing Tool Dependencies**

To add tools to your module, use the `-tool` flag with `go get`:

```sh
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

This automatically updates `go.mod`, adding the tools under the `tool` directive along with `require` statements to ensure version tracking.

### Install Tools

Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the `go.mod` file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```sh
go install ./...
```

### Download the binaries

You may alternatively download the binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
We generate [SLSA3 signatures](slsa.dev) using the OpenSSF&#039;s [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) during the release process. To verify a release binary:

1. Install the verification tool from [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation).
2. Download the provenance file `attestation.intoto.jsonl` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest).
3. Run the verifier:

```shell
slsa-verifier -artifact-path &lt;the-binary&gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &lt;the-tag&gt;
```

Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.

## Usage

### 1.Define your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) service using protocol buffers

`your_service.proto`:

```protobuf
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
```

### 2. Generate gRPC stubs

This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:

Here&#039;s an example `buf.gen.yaml` you can use to generate the stubs with [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf):

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

With this file in place, you can generate your files using `buf generate`.

&gt; For a complete example of using `buf generate` to generate protobuf stubs, see
&gt; [the boilerplate repo](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).
&gt; For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see
&gt; [the official documentation](https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage).

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, here&#039;s an example of what a command
might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.

### 4. Generate reverse-proxy using `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway`

At this point, you have 3 options:

- no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.)
  - this will work on any `.proto` file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar
- additional `.proto` modifications to use a custom mapping
  - relies on parameters in the `.proto` file to set custom HTTP mappings
- no `.proto` modifications, but use an external configuration file
  - relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings
  - mostly useful when the source proto file isn&#039;t under your control

#### 1. Using the default mapping

This requires no additional modification to the `.proto` file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin.
The `generate_unbound_methods` should be enabled.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 2. With custom annotations

Add a [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46)
annotation to your .proto file

`your_service.proto`:

```diff
 syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1&quot;;
+
+import &quot;google/api/annotations.proto&quot;;
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: &quot;/v1/example/echo&quot;
+      body: &quot;*&quot;
+    };
+  }
 }
```

&gt; You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler.
&gt; If you are using [buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), this dependency can
&gt; be added to the `deps` array in your `buf.yaml` under the name
&gt; `buf.build/googleapis/googleapis`:
&gt;
&gt; ```yaml
&gt; version: v2
&gt; name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
&gt; deps:
&gt;   - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&gt; ```
&gt;
&gt; Always run `buf dep update` after adding a dependency to your `buf.yaml`.

See [a_bit_of_everything.proto](examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto)
for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior
and generated OpenAPI output.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required
dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found
by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the
[googleapis repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), and providing
them to `protoc` when running. The files you will need are:

```
google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
```

Here&#039;s what a `protoc` execution might look like:

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

#### 3. External configuration

If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can
alternatively use an external
[gRPC Service Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config) file.
[Check our documentation](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/)
for more information. This is best combined with the `standalone=true` option
to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files
generated by the source protobuf file.

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like with this option enabled:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

With `protoc` (just the grpc-gateway stubs):

```sh
protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

### 5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server

```go
package main

import (
  &quot;context&quot;
  &quot;flag&quot;
  &quot;net/http&quot;

  &quot;github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure&quot;
  &quot;google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog&quot;

  gw &quot;github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service&quot;  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String(&quot;grpc-server-endpoint&quot;,  &quot;localhost:9090&quot;, &quot;gRPC server endpoint&quot;)
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8081&quot;, mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
```

### 6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using `protoc-gen-openapiv2`

Here&#039;s what a `buf.gen.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
```

To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by `protoc-gen-openapiv2`, we need
another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using
`buf`, you can add the `buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` dependency
to your `deps` array:

```yaml
version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
```

With `protoc` (just the swagger file):

```sh
protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
```

If you are using `protoc` to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf
files from the `protoc-gen-openapiv2/options` directory of this repository,
and providing them to `protoc` when running.

Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods;
use the `generate_unbound_methods` option to enable this.

It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings
with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.

`/v1/{name=projects/*}` and `/v1/{name=organizations/*}` both become `/v1/{name}`. When
this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a &quot;\_1&quot; (or &quot;\_2&quot; etc) suffix
to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become
`/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}`. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the &quot;/&quot; that is
part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to
accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or
UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See
[Customizing Your Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/)
for more information.

## Usage with remote plugins

As an alternative to all of the above, you can use `buf` with
[remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage)
to manage plugin versions and generation. An example `buf.gen.yaml` using remote
plugin generation looks like this:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
```

This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same
version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using `v2.16.2`, run

```shell
$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
```

To get the same version of the runtime in your `go.mod`.

Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like [grpc_api_configuration](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file).

## Video intro

This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer [@JohanBrandhorst](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst) provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

## Parameters and flags

When using `buf` to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through
the `opt` field in your `buf.gen.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
```

During code generation with `protoc`, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed
through `protoc` using one of 2 patterns:

- as part of the `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out` `protoc` parameter: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_out=&lt;flags&gt;:&lt;path&gt;`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
```

- using additional `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt` parameters: `--&lt;tool_suffix&gt;_opt=&lt;flag&gt;[,&lt;flag&gt;]*`

```sh
--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
```

Cobra is a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications.

Cobra is used in many Go projects such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) to
name a few. [This list](site/content/projects_using_cobra.md) contains a more extensive list of projects using Cobra.

# Overview

Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI
interfaces similar to git &amp; go tools.

Cobra provides:
* Easy subcommand-based CLIs: `app server`, `app fetch`, etc.
* Fully POSIX-compliant flags (including short &amp; long versions)
* Nested subcommands
* Global, local and cascading flags
* Intelligent suggestions (`app srver`... did you mean `app server`?)
* Automatic help generation for commands and flags

# Concepts

Cobra is built on a structure of commands, arguments &amp; flags.

**Commands** represent actions, **Args** are things and **Flags** are modifiers for those actions.

The best applications read like sentences when used, and as a result, users
intuitively know how to interact with them.

The pattern to follow is
`APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE`
    or
`APPNAME COMMAND ARG --FLAG`.

A few good real world examples may better illustrate this point.

In the following example, &#039;server&#039; is a command, and &#039;port&#039; is a flag:

    hugo server --port=1313

In this command we are telling Git to clone the url bare.

    git clone URL --bare

## Commands

Command is the central point of the application. Each interaction that
the application supports will be contained in a Command. A command can
have children commands and optionally run an action.

In the example above, &#039;server&#039; is the command.

[More about cobra.Command](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra#Command)

## Flags

A flag is a way to modify the behavior of a command. Cobra supports
fully POSIX-compliant flags as well as the Go [flag package](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/).
A Cobra command can define flags that persist through to children commands
and flags that are only available to that command.

In the example above, &#039;port&#039; is the flag.

Flag functionality is provided by the [pflag
library](https://github.com/spf13/pflag), a fork of the flag standard library
which maintains the same interface while adding POSIX compliance.

# Installing
Using Cobra is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library.

```
go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest
```

Next, include Cobra in your application:

```go
import &quot;github.com/spf13/cobra&quot;
```

# Usage
`cobra-cli` is a command line program to generate cobra applications and command files.
It will bootstrap your application scaffolding to rapidly
develop a Cobra-based application. It is the easiest way to incorporate Cobra into your application.

It can be installed by running:

```
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

For complete details on using the Cobra-CLI generator, please read [The Cobra Generator README](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/blob/main/README.md)

For complete details on using the Cobra library, please read [The Cobra User Guide](site/content/user_guide.md).

![Moby Project logo](docs/static_files/moby-project-logo.png &quot;The Moby Project&quot;)

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.

It provides a &quot;Lego set&quot; of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.

## Principles

Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

- Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
- Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container systems, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
- Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
- Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

## Audience

The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.

## Relationship with Docker

The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.

The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only. For customers who want enterprise or commercial support, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) are the appropriate products for these use cases.

K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage
your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes
for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.

---

## Note...

K9s is not pimped out by a big corporation with deep pockets.
It is a complex OSS project that demands a lot of my time to maintain and support.
K9s will always remain OSS and therefore free! That said, if you feel k9s makes your day to day Kubernetes journey a tad brighter, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring us!](https://github.com/sponsors/derailed)
Your donations will go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge!

**Thank you!**

## Building From Source

 K9s is currently using GO v1.23.X or above.
 In order to build K9s from source you must:

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Build and run the executable

      ```shell
      make build &amp;&amp; ./execs/k9s
      ```

---

## Running with Docker

### Running the official Docker image

  You can run k9s as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s
  ```

  For default path it would be:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s
  ```

### Building your own Docker image

  You can build your own Docker image of k9s from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with the following:

  ```shell
  docker build -t k9s-docker:v0.0.1 .
  ```

  You can get the latest stable `kubectl` version and pass it to the `docker build` command with the `--build-arg` option.
  You can use the `--build-arg` option to pass any valid `kubectl` version (like `v1.18.0` or `v1.19.1`).

  ```shell
  KUBECTL_VERSION=$(make kubectl-stable-version 2&gt;/dev/null)
  docker build --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=${KUBECTL_VERSION} -t k9s-docker:0.1 .
  ```

  Run your container:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config k9s-docker:0.1
  ```

---

## PreFlight Checks

* K9s uses 256 colors terminal mode. On `Nix system make sure TERM is set accordingly.

    ```shell
    export TERM=xterm-256color
    ```

* In order to issue resource edit commands make sure your EDITOR and KUBE_EDITOR env vars are set.

    ```shell
    # Kubectl edit command will use this env var.
    export KUBE_EDITOR=my_fav_editor
    ```

* K9s prefers recent kubernetes versions ie 1.28+

### View K9s logs

```shell
tail -f /Users/fernand/.local/data/k9s/k9s.log
```

### Start K9s in debug mode

```shell
k9s -l debug
```

### Customize logs destination

You can override the default log file destination either with the `--logFile` argument:

```shell
k9s --logFile /tmp/k9s.log
less /tmp/k9s.log
```

Or through the `K9S_LOGS_DIR` environment variable:

```shell
K9S_LOGS_DIR=/var/log k9s
less /var/log/k9s.log
```

## Key Bindings

K9s uses aliases to navigate most K8s resources.

## K9s Configuration

  K9s keeps its configurations as YAML files inside of a `k9s` directory and the location depends on your operating system. K9s leverages [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link](https://github.com/adrg/xdg/blob/master/README.md). If you are still confused a quick `k9s info` will reveal where k9s is loading its configurations from. Alternatively, you can set `K9S_CONFIG_DIR` to tell K9s the directory location to pull its configurations from.

  | Unix            | macOS                              | Windows               |
  |-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
  | `~/.config/k9s` | `~/Library/Application Support/k9s` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\k9s`  |

  &gt; NOTE: This is still in flux and will change while in pre-release stage!

You can now override the context portForward default address configuration by setting an env variable that can override all clusters portForward local address using `K9S_DEFAULT_PF_ADDRESS=a.b.c.d`

  ```yaml
  # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml
  k9s:
    # Enable periodic refresh of resource browser windows. Default false
    liveViewAutoRefresh: false
    # The path to screen dump. Default: &#039;%temp_dir%/k9s-screens-%username%&#039; (k9s info)
    screenDumpDir: /tmp/dumps

## &lt;a id=&quot;popeye&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Popeye Configuration

K9s has integration with [Popeye](https://popeyecli.io/), which is a Kubernetes cluster sanitizer.  Popeye itself uses a configuration called `spinach.yml`, but when integrating with K9s the cluster-specific file should be name `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/share/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/spinach.yml`.  This allows you to have a different spinach config per cluster.

---

## Node Shell

By enabling the nodeShell feature gate on a given cluster, K9s allows you to shell into your cluster nodes. Once enabled, you will have a new `s` for `shell` menu option while in node view. K9s will launch a pod on the selected node using a spec

# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib

This is a repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. 

The official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the &quot;core&quot; distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.

Each component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there&#039;s a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.

## Stability levels

Stability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Gated features

Some features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

## Support

Each component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.

The OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.

Even though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.

### No Over-Representation

A community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer. Job changes and similar events might result in over-representation, and no new maintainers from the same company can be promoted until representation is balanced again. In the event of confusion or concern, the OpenTelemetry Collector SIG will defer to the CNCF definition of &quot;same employer&quot;.

## PRs and Reviews

When creating a PR please follow the process [described
here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-structure-prs-to-get-expedient-reviews).

New PRs will be automatically associated with the reviewers based on
[CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs will be also automatically assigned to one of the
maintainers or approvers for facilitation.

The facilitator is responsible for helping the PR author and reviewers to make progress
or if progress cannot be made for closing the PR.

If the reviewers do not have approval rights the facilitator is also responsible
for the official approval that is required for the PR to be merged and if the facilitator
is a maintainer they are responsible for merging the PR as well.

The facilitator is not required to perform a thorough review, but they are encouraged to
enforce Collector best practices and consistency across the codebase and component
behavior. The facilitators will typically rely on codeowner&#039;s detailed review of the code
when making the final approval decision.

Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.

It has the following **unique** features:

-   Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators.
-   Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated.
-   Ability to dive into both map keys and values for validation
-   Handles type interface by determining it&#039;s underlying type prior to validation.
-   Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see [Valuer](https://golang.org/src/database/sql/driver/types.go?s=1210:1293#L29)
-   Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
-   Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting FieldError
-   Customizable i18n aware error messages.
-   Default validator for the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework; upgrading from v8 to v9 in gin see [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/master/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)

A Call for Maintainers
----------------------

Please read the discussiong started [here](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/discussions/1330) if you are interested in contributing/helping maintain this package.

Installation
------------

Use go get.

	go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10

Then import the validator package into your own code.

	import &quot;github.com/go-playground/validator/v10&quot;

Error Return Value
-------

Validation functions return type error

They return type error to avoid the issue discussed in the following, where err is always != nil:

* http://stackoverflow.com/a/29138676/3158232
* https://github.com/go-playground/validator/issues/134

Validator returns only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check if the error returned is not nil, and if it&#039;s not check if error is InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn&#039;t ) type cast it to type ValidationErrors like so:

```go
err := validate.Struct(mystruct)
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
 ```

Usage and documentation
------

Please see https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 for detailed usage docs.

##### Examples:

- [Simple](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/simple/main.go)
- [Custom Field Types](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/custom/main.go)
- [Struct Level](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/struct-level/main.go)
- [Translations &amp; Custom Errors](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/blob/master/_examples/translations/main.go)
- [Gin upgrade and/or override validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/v9/_examples/gin-upgrading-overriding)
- [wash - an example application putting it all together](https://github.com/bluesuncorp/wash)

Baked-in Validations
------

### Special Notes:
- If new to using validator it is highly recommended to initialize it using the `WithRequiredStructEnabled` option which is opt-in to new behaviour that will become the default behaviour in v11+. See documentation for more details.
```go
validate := validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())
```

### Fields:

| Tag | Description |
| - | - |
| eqcsfield | Field Equals Another Field (relative)|
| eqfield | Field Equals Another Field |
| fieldcontains | Check the indicated characters are present in the Field |
| fieldexcludes | Check the indicated characters are not present in the field |
| gtcsfield | Field Greater Than Another Relative Field |
| gtecsfield | Field Greater Than or Equal To Another Relative Field |
| gtefield | Field Greater Than or Equal To Another Field |
| gtfield | Field Greater Than Another Field |

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; 最新版Docker镜像：`calciumion/new-api:latest`  
&gt; 默认账号root 密码123456

### 多机部署注意事项
- 必须设置环境变量 `SESSION_SECRET`，否则会导致多机部署时登录状态不一致
- 如果公用Redis，必须设置 `CRYPTO_SECRET`，否则会导致多机部署时Redis内容无法获取

### 部署要求
- 本地数据库（默认）：SQLite（Docker部署必须挂载`/data`目录）
- 远程数据库：MySQL版本 &gt;= 5.7.8，PgSQL版本 &gt;= 9.6

### 部署方式

#### 使用宝塔面板Docker功能部署
安装宝塔面板（**9.2.0版本**及以上），在应用商店中找到**New-API**安装即可。
[图文教程](BT.md)

#### 使用Docker Compose部署（推荐）
```shell
# 下载项目
git clone https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api.git
cd new-api
# 按需编辑docker-compose.yml
# 启动
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 直接使用Docker镜像
```shell
# 使用SQLite
docker run --name new-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data calciumion/new-api:latest

# 使用MySQL
docker run --name new-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e SQL_DSN=&quot;root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi&quot; -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data calciumion/new-api:latest
```

## 渠道重试与缓存
渠道重试功能已经实现，可以在`设置-&gt;运营设置-&gt;通用设置`设置重试次数，**建议开启缓存**功能。

### 缓存设置方法
1. `REDIS_CONN_STRING`：设置Redis作为缓存
2. `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`：启用内存缓存（设置了Redis则无需手动设置）

&lt;br&gt;

**NetBird combines a configuration-free peer-to-peer private network and a centralized access control system in a single platform, making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.**

**Connect.** NetBird creates a WireGuard-based overlay network that automatically connects your machines over an encrypted tunnel, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

**Secure.** NetBird enables secure remote access by applying granular access policies while allowing you to manage them intuitively from a single place. Works universally on any infrastructure.

### Quickstart with NetBird Cloud

- Download and install NetBird at [https://app.netbird.io/install](https://app.netbird.io/install)
- Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.
- Check NetBird [admin UI](https://app.netbird.io/).
- Add more machines.

### Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird

&gt; This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the [Advanced guide with a custom identity provider](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider) for installations with different IDPs.

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- A Linux VM with at least **1CPU** and **2GB** of memory.
- The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports **80** and **443** and UDP ports: **3478**, **49152-65535**.
- **Public domain** name pointing to the VM.

**Software requirements:**
- Docker installed on the VM with the docker-compose plugin ([Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. In most distributions
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo yum install jq`
- [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
  Usually available in the official repositories and can be installed with `sudo apt install curl` or `sudo yum install curl`

**Steps**
- Download and run the installation script:
```bash
export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com; curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started-with-zitadel.sh | bash
```
- Once finished, you can manage the resources via `docker-compose`

### A bit on NetBird internals
-  Every machine in the network runs [NetBird Agent (or Client)](client/) that manages WireGuard.
-  Every agent connects to [Management Service](management/) that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).
-  NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in [pion/ice library](https://github.com/pion/ice) to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.
-  Connection candidates are discovered with the help of [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) servers.
-  Agents negotiate a connection through [Signal Service](signal/) passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.
-  Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and a p2p connection isn&#039;t possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server. 
 
[Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.

### Community projects
-  [NetBird installer script](https://github.com/physk/netbird-installer)
-  [NetBird ansible collection by Dominion Solutions](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/dominion_solutions/netbird/)

**Note**: The `main` branch may be in an *unstable or even broken state* during development.
For stable versions, see [releases](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases).

### Support acknowledgement

In November 2022, NetBird joined the [StartUpSecure program](https://www.forschung-it-sicherheit-kommunikationssysteme.de/foerderung/bekanntmachungen/startup-secure) sponsored by The Federal Ministry of Education and Research of The Federal Republic of Germany. Together with [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) NetBird brings the security best practices and simplicity to private networking.

### Testimonials
We use open-source technologies like [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/), [Pion ICE (WebRTC)](https://github.com/pion/ice), [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn), and [Rosenpass](https://rosenpass.eu). We very much appreciate the work these guys are doing and we&#039;d greatly appreciate if you could support them in any way (e.g., by giving a star or a contribution).

            <h2>README</h2><pre>Testify - Thou Shalt Write Tests
================================

&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; Testify is being maintained at v1, no breaking changes will be accepted in this repo.  
&gt; [See discussion about v2](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/discussions/1560).

[![Build Status](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/stretchr/testify) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see https://go.dev/doc/code#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify
  * Use [testifylint](https://github.com/Antonboom/testifylint) (via [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)) to avoid common mistakes
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

[`assert`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, &quot;they should be equal&quot;)

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, &quot;they should not be equal&quot;)

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn&#039;t nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, &quot;Something&quot;, object.Value)

  }

}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, &quot;they should be equal&quot;)

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, &quot;they should not be equal&quot;)

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn&#039;t nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(&quot;Something&quot;, object.Value)
  }
}
```

[`require`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/require &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.
These functions must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function, not from other goroutines created during the test.
Otherwise race conditions may occur.

See [t.FailNow](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.FailNow) for details.

[`mock`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can set up expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
  &quot;testing&quot;
  &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/mock&quot;
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct{
  mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we&#039;re just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {

  args := m.Called(number)
  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)

}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // set up expectations
  testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, 123).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)


}

// TestSomethingWithPlaceholder is a second example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
// This time using a placeholder. Placeholders might be used when the
// data being passed in is normally dynamically generated and cannot be
// predicted beforehand (eg. containing hashes that are time sensitive)
func TestSomethingWithPlaceholder(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
  testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)


}

// TestSomethingElse2 is a third example that shows how you can use
// the Unset method to cleanup handlers and then add new ones.
func TestSomethingElse2(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
  mockCall := testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

  // remove the handler now so we can add another one that takes precedence
  mockCall.Unset()

  // return false now instead of true
  testObj.On(&quot;DoSomething&quot;, mock.Anything).Return(false, nil)

  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/latest/) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

[`suite`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite &quot;API documentation&quot;) package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; [!WARNING]
&gt; The suite package does not support parallel tests. See [#934](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/issues/934).

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object-oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with &#039;go test&#039; as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    &quot;testing&quot;
    &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
    &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/suite&quot;
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including a T() method which
// returns the current testing context
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with &quot;Test&quot; are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for &#039;go test&#039; to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

`Suite` object has assertion methods:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    &quot;testing&quot;
    &quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/suite&quot;
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with &quot;Test&quot; are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
}

// In order for &#039;go test&#039; to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

**ntfy** (pronounced &quot;*notify*&quot;) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) 
notification service. With ntfy, you can **send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts** from any computer, 
**without having to sign up or pay any fees**. If you&#039;d like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do 
so since ntfy is open source.

You can access the free version of ntfy at **[ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)**. There is also an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android)
available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/),
as well as an [open source iOS app](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios) available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347).

OpenTelemetry-Go is the [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
It provides a set of APIs to directly measure performance and behavior of your software and send this data to observability platforms.

### Compatibility

OpenTelemetry-Go ensures compatibility with the current supported versions of
the [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy):

&gt; Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
&gt; For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release.

For versions of Go that are no longer supported upstream, opentelemetry-go will
stop ensuring compatibility with these versions in the following manner:

- A minor release of opentelemetry-go will be made to add support for the new
  supported release of Go.
- The following minor release of opentelemetry-go will remove compatibility
  testing for the oldest (now archived upstream) version of Go. This, and
  future, releases of opentelemetry-go may include features only supported by
  the currently supported versions of Go.

Currently, this project supports the following environments.

| OS       | Go Version | Architecture |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | 386          |
| Ubuntu   | 1.24       | arm64        |
| Ubuntu   | 1.23       | arm64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.24       | amd64        |
| macOS 13 | 1.23       | amd64        |
| macOS    | 1.24       | arm64        |
| macOS    | 1.23       | arm64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.23       | amd64        |
| Windows  | 1.24       | 386          |
| Windows  | 1.23       | 386          |

While this project should work for other systems, no compatibility guarantees
are made for those systems currently.

## Getting Started

You can find a getting started guide on [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/getting-started/).

OpenTelemetry&#039;s goal is to provide a single set of APIs to capture distributed
traces and metrics from your application and send them to an observability
platform. This project allows you to do just that for applications written in
Go. There are two steps to this process: instrument your application, and
configure an exporter.

### Instrumentation

To start capturing distributed traces and metric events from your application
it first needs to be instrumented. The easiest way to do this is by using an
instrumentation library for your code. Be sure to check out [the officially
supported instrumentation
libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

If you need to extend the telemetry an instrumentation library provides or want
to build your own instrumentation for your application directly you will need
to use the
[Go otel](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel)
package. The [examples](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/examples)
are a good way to see some practical uses of this process.

### Export

Now that your application is instrumented to collect telemetry, it needs an
export pipeline to send that telemetry to an observability platform.

All officially supported exporters for the OpenTelemetry project are contained in the [exporters directory](./exporters).

| Exporter                              | Logs | Metrics | Traces |
|---------------------------------------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|
| [OTLP](./exporters/otlp/)             |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Prometheus](./exporters/prometheus/) |      |    ✓    |        |
| [stdout](./exporters/stdout/)         |  ✓   |    ✓    |   ✓    |
| [Zipkin](./exporters/zipkin/)         |      |         |   ✓    |

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a &quot;planning&quot; step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.

- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.

The present repository contains the source code of the Datadog Agent version 7 and version 6. Please refer to the [Agent user documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) for information about differences between Agent v5, Agent v6 and Agent v7. Additionally, we provide a list of prepackaged binaries for an easy install process [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings/agent/latest?platform=overview)

**Note:** the source code of Datadog Agent v5 is located in the
[dd-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent) repository.

## Documentation

The general documentation of the project, including instructions for installation
and development, is located under [the docs directory](docs) of the present repo.

## Getting started

To build the Agent you need:
 * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.23 or later. You&#039;ll also need to set your `$GOPATH` and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your path.
 * Python 3.11+ along with development libraries for tooling. You will also need Python 2.7 if you are building the Agent with Python 2 support.
 * Python dependencies. You may install these with `pip install dda`.
 * CMake version 3.15 or later and a C++ compiler

**Note:** you may want to use a python virtual environment to avoid polluting your
      system-wide python environment with the agent build/dev dependencies. You can
      create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` and then use the `dda inv agent.build`
      parameters `--python-home-3=&lt;venv_path&gt;` to use the virtual environment&#039;s
      interpreter and libraries. By default, this environment is only used for dev dependencies.

**Note:** You may have previously installed `invoke` via brew on MacOS, or `pip` in
      any other platform. We recommend you use the version pinned in the requirements
      file for a smooth development/build experience.

**Note:** You can enable auto completion for invoke tasks. Use the command below to add the appropriate line to your `.zshrc` file.
      `echo &quot;source &lt;(dda inv --print-completion-script zsh)&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc`

Builds and tests are orchestrated with `invoke`, type `dda inv --list` on a shell
to see the available tasks.

To start working on the Agent, you can build the `main` branch:

1. Checkout the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
2. cd into the project folder: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
3. Install go tools: `dda inv install-tools` (if you have a timeout error, you might need to prepend the `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,https://goproxy.io,direct` env var to the command).
4. Create a development `datadog.yaml` configuration file in `dev/dist/datadog.yaml`, containing a valid API key: `api_key: &lt;API_KEY&gt;`. You can either start with an empty one or use the full one generated by the Agent build from Step 5 (located in `cmd/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` after the build finishes).
5. Build the agent with `dda inv agent.build --build-exclude=systemd`.

     You can specify a custom Python location for the agent (useful when using
     virtualenvs):

       dda inv agent.build \
         --python-home-3=$GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/venv3

    Running `dda inv agent.build`:

     * Discards any changes done in `bin/agent/dist`.
     * Builds the Agent and writes the binary to `bin/agent/agent`.
     * Copies files from `dev/dist` to `bin/agent/dist`. See `https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/dev/dist/README.md` for more information.

     If you built an older version of the agent, you may have the error `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.`. To solve the issue, you should remove `CMakeCache.txt` from `rtloader` folder with `rm rtloader/CMakeCache.txt`.

     Please note that the [trace agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/) needs to be built and run separately.



Please refer to the [Agent Developer Guide](docs/dev/README.md) for more details. For instructions
on setting up a windows dev environment, refer to [Windows Dev Env](devenv).

## Testing

Run unit tests using `dda inv test`.
```
dda inv test --targets=./pkg/aggregator
```

You can also use `dda inv linter.go` to run just the go linters.
```
dda inv linter.go
```

When testing code that depends on [rtloader](/rtloader), build and install it first.
```
dda inv rtloader.make &amp;&amp; dda inv rtloader.install
dda inv test --targets=./pkg/collector/python
```

## Run

You can run the agent with:
```
./bin/agent/agent run -c bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml
```

The file `bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` is copied from `dev/dist/datadog.yaml` by `dda inv agent.build` and must contain a valid api key.

### Run a JMX check
In order to run a JMX based check locally, you must have:
1. A copy of a JMXFetch `jar` copied to `dev/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar`
2. `java` available on your `$PATH`

For detailed instructions, see [JMX checks](./docs/dev/checks/jmxfetch.md)

&lt;br&gt;

## Installation

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a new directory called `glance` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir glance &amp;&amp; cd glance &amp;&amp; curl -sL https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xzf - --strip-components 2
```

*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Other files you may want to edit&lt;/summary&gt;

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS
&lt;/details&gt;

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker compose manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Then, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config &amp;&amp; wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs glance
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual binary installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Precompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).

### Linux

Visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it&#039;s placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:

```bash
/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml
```

To grab a starting template for the config file, run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml
```

### Windows

Download and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you&#039;re on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.



&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Glance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:
* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)
* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&amp;show=glance)
* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Building from source

Choose one of the following methods:

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build binary with Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) &gt;= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
go build -o build/glance .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you&#039;re testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build project and Docker image with Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To build the project and image using just Docker, run:

*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*

```bash
docker build -t owner/glance:latest .
```

If you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:

```bash
docker push owner/glance:latest
```

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## FAQ
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the information on the page update automatically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How frequently do widgets update?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
No requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I create my own widgets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:
* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites
* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML
* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL
* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I change the title of a widget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

Yes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget&#039;s configuration:

```yaml
- type: rss
  title: My custom title

- type: markets
  title: My custom title

- type: videos
  title: My custom title

# and so on for all widgets...
```
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

## Feature requests

New feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Feature requests are tagged with one of the following:

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release
* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community
* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn&#039;t currently align with the project&#039;s goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date

&lt;br&gt;

## Contributing guidelines

* Before working on a new feature it&#039;s preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you&#039;d like to implement it yourself
* Please don&#039;t submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, backlog&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; or icebox&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use `dev` for the base branch if you&#039;re adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`
* Avoid introducing new dependencies
* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes
* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`
* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable
* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible
* No `package.json`

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1] [2] [3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;

[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation

[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear

[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][], [vulcand][], [Doorman][], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Maintainers

[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).

## Getting started

### Getting etcd

The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].

For more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).

[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases

### Running etcd

First start a single-member cluster of etcd.

If etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:

```bash
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
```

The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:

```bash
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let&#039;s set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```bash
etcdctl put mykey &quot;this is awesome&quot;
etcdctl get mykey
```

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)
* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)

### etcd TCP ports

The [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.

[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

### Running a local etcd cluster

First install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.

Our [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:

```bash
goreman start
```

This will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.

Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.

Follow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.

### Install etcd client v3

```bash
go get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3
```

### Next steps

Now it&#039;s time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

* Read the full [documentation].
* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].
* Explore the full gRPC [API].
* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].
* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
* [Tune etcd][tuning].

### Community meetings

etcd contributors and maintainers meet every week at `11:00` AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday and meetings alternate between community meetings and issue triage meetings. Meeting agendas are recorded in a [shared Google doc][shared-meeting-notes] and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.

Issue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don&#039;t have to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get started contributing.

The meeting lead role is rotated for each meeting between etcd maintainers or sig-etcd leads and is recorded in a [shared Google sheet][shared-rotation-sheet].

Meeting recordings are uploaded to the official etcd [YouTube channel].

**[We are hiring!](https://www.loft.sh/careers) Come build the future of remote development environments with us.**

DevPod is a client-only tool to create reproducible developer environments based on a [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/) on any backend. Each developer environment runs in a container and is specified through a [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/). Through DevPod providers, these environments can be created on any backend, such as the local computer, a Kubernetes cluster, any reachable remote machine, or in a VM in the cloud.

![Codespaces](docs/static/media/codespaces-but.png)

You can think of DevPod as the glue that connects your local IDE to a machine where you want to develop. So depending on the requirements of your project, you can either create a workspace locally on the computer, on a beefy cloud machine with many GPUs, or a spare remote computer. Within DevPod, every workspace is managed the same way, which also makes it easy to switch between workspaces that might be hosted somewhere else.

![DevPod Flow](docs/static/media/devpod-flow.gif)

## Quickstart

Download DevPod Desktop:
- [MacOS Silicon/ARM](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_macos_aarch64.dmg)
- [MacOS Intel/AMD](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_macos_x64.dmg)
- [Windows](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_windows_x64_en-US.msi)
- [Linux AppImage](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_linux_amd64.AppImage)

Take a look at the [DevPod Docs](https://devpod.sh/docs/getting-started/install) for more information.

## Why DevPod?

DevPod reuses the open [DevContainer standard](https://containers.dev/) (used by GitHub Codespaces and VSCode DevContainers) to create a consistent developer experience no matter what backend you want to use.

Compared to hosted services such as Github Codespaces, JetBrains Spaces, or Google Cloud Workstations, DevPod has the following advantages:
* **Cost savings**: DevPod is usually around 5-10 times cheaper than existing services with comparable feature sets because it uses bare virtual machines in any cloud and shuts down unused virtual machines automatically.
* **No vendor lock-in**: Choose whatever cloud provider suits you best, be it the cheapest one or the most powerful, DevPod supports all cloud providers. If you are tired of using a provider, change it with a single command.
* **Local development**: You get the same developer experience also locally, so you don&#039;t need to rely on a cloud provider at all.
* **Cross IDE support**: VSCode and the full JetBrains suite is supported, all others can be connected through simple ssh.
* **Client-only**: No need to install a server backend, DevPod runs only on your computer.
* **Open-Source**: DevPod is 100% open-source and extensible. A provider doesn&#039;t exist? Just create your own.
* **Rich feature set**: DevPod already supports prebuilds, auto inactivity shutdown, git &amp; docker credentials sync, and many more features to come.
* **Desktop App**: DevPod comes with an easy-to-use desktop application that abstracts all the complexity away. If you want to build your own integration, DevPod offers a feature-rich CLI as well.
